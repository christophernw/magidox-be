first off pray,an then remember this life is no joke but it is something that you only have one of,try to always keep your head held high an your mind open that hey things are bad but they could be worse,an if things are worse you have to be strong you just have to put your self around positive things,loved ones an have someone you can talk to.If there is family members,a friend or someone you can talk.Have something or someone that is positive around.No matter what life throws at you a break up with someone special,death,drugs,or whatever always remember there is always life ahead of you an you can make it.Be strong an remember that you are in control an you can do this.Remember put all the negative things behind you are to the side even an put positive things in your life.Because there is always tomorrow,an there is love out there do not ever give up.because you are a strong person do not ever forget that,no matter what has happen or will happen. no matter what you have an will always be strong. because it takes strength to do what you did [ask for help]it takes a lot for someone to reach out to someone for advise.

A counselor is someone who is not a doctor but has special training in talking to people and helping them with their problems. Your school guidance counselor is one type of counselor. Many social workers are counselors. A priest or rabbi can be a spiritual counselor. There are even counselors who just help people find out what they'd be good at for a career. . . When you have personal problems, trouble at home, or are feeling bad and need to talk to someone, you most likely would want to see a social worker. Social workers who counsel are usually called counselors or therapists. Again, they are not doctors, but they know how to talk to people who have issues and suggest ways to resolve them. They may refer you to a doctor if they feel you need extra help to resolve your problems. They will have the letters CSW or MSW after their names.

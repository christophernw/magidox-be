A person is supposed to eat every 4 hours(it takes so long for complete digestion of the food).. . When we have not eaten food for some time,the stomach is empty.the stomach wall will secrete acids(HCl) and enzymes for digestion of food wether food is present in stomach or not...this results in accumulation of acid and enzymes in the stomach which causes the "grumbling noise" in the stomach.. . This signal's to the brain that the body needs food...thereby causing hunger pangs.

Sure...dog is a delicacy here. I'm sure it will be welcomed.. . But in all seriousness, the hassles involved when bringing a dog into China, and then returning to your own country will be numerous, not to say expensive. . . Unless you are ultra-patient and ultra-rich, I advise you to keep the dog at home.

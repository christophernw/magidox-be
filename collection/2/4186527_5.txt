It's very hard to get the big chains to carry your book if you're not working through an agent, but you can always try going to independent bookstores and seeing if they will carry your book for you - many will probably say no, but you may be able to schedule a book signing or two, and if they are interested in the book, they may carry it.. . This is especially true for "local" books (things only of interest to people in your immediate geographic area) that they know people won't getting elsewhere.

This could be one of many things, and i would suggest you visit your doctor.  However, when i experienced the same symptoms, it was caused by stress from my job that in turn made me prone to a kidney infection.  To be on the safe side, whilst you are waiting for an appointment at your doctor's surgery, remember to drink lots of water during the day and before bed.  it could be that you are dehydrated due to an infection.. . Go to the docs though!  and good luck

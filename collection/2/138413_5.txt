To add to what thychael88 said, there's also history. . Fact: 'Old Bill' was King William IV, whose constables were an early form of police.  . Fact: Constables of the watch were sometimes nicknamed for the bills, or billhooks they carried as weapons.. . Those constables were Vill's (William) bills (police). I propose that this is the origin of the nickname Bill connected to the name William.

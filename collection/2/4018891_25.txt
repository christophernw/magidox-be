All you have to do is google the word, if it comes back copyrighted, then  you have to contact the entity that has the publishing rights of the name. It's a bit tedious, and it might take some time to accomplish, but you're better off doing things legit, than face legal action once their corporate lawyers catch wind of your infraction. Once  you find out who has the legal rights over the name, all you have to do is make a request in writing to use the name. Sometimes they are cool about it and will allow you to use the name for free, the only thing you'll have to do is list that they have authorized it on your book credit's portion. Sometimes they will charge you a fee, but it's usually bereable. Good luck.

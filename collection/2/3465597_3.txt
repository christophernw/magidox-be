Excellent question! I couldn't find any reliable source to answer, so I only have mildly plausible theories to offer.  As others said, the Tetragrammaton (YHWH, Yahweh) is the forbidden name of God. The name cannot be said aloud, except by the High Priest on one special occasion; indeed, no one is sure how it should be pronounced. Also, it is only one of many names of God. . . So, early Christian theologians may not have used the name prominently because:. (a) as a Jewish sect, the taboo was still very strong against that name, in both the mind of the writers and the followers. . (b) Christian theologians may have wanted to differentiate the cult from mainstream Judaism by not mentioning any name of God at all, but simply calling him 'Lord' or 'Father'. Especially if Jesus didn't use the name himself (taboo!). I know no Ancient Greek to read the originals, so this is purely speculative.. . (c) The New Testament was written in Greek; YHWH has many layers of meaning in Hebrew, but none in Greek. Early Christians may have simply disfavoured the name, since 'Lord' was more meaningful.. . The name Jehovah *does* appear a few times in King James translation of the old Testament, so I suppose (a) and maybe (b) are the causes, and (c) is the main reason: the name fell out of use because there was no tradition of using it.

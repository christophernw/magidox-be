care to give a specific example?. . where does one passage totally disagree with another?. . and don't use your justification for disagreeing as a lack of physical evidence. . we actually lack the physical evidence that dinosaurs were ever alive (think about it, all we have are bones, that's not evidence that they were alive), we lack evidence that we evolved from monkeys (think about it, we have no eye-witness accounts) and we lack physical evidence for wind (you can't see wind, you only see the results from wind--moving trees, things falling over, moving clouds--wind is moving air which is invisible). . before you question a faith or a belief system that is centered on a metaphysical point...consider questioning any system of belief built upon the collective data of persons that are dead with observations that are justifiable only by collective agreement.

You made a big, and common, mistake.. . You paid off the bill without getting the creditor to agree to remove the listing from your credit report.  Now that he has your money, don't count on any cooperation from them.. . You can try contacting the credit reporting agency, but be advised the best they will do is show the loan is paid off.  But other "negative" information will remain, such as late payments, or the fact it went to collections.. . They will not change or remove this information.  The only way to get it changed is through the Creditor.....the guy who now has your money and couldn't care less about your ruined credit history.. . Do not let anyone tell you the creditor can't change/remove negative information on your report.  They are lying!. . Several credit collectors have posted on this forum that you can not do it, but fail to supply a single place where I can verify their claims.  Until that time, I will go by what the Fair Credit Reporting Act says.  . . Creditors can and will change/remove this information.  You just need some leverage.  You gave that away when you paid your bill in full.. . All you can do now is politely ask the creditor to change your record.  You can also post a comment in your credit report explaining your side, and protest the report.  But it rarely works.. . Read the links below for help.

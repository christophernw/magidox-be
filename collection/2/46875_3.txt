I think, because it is about for a limited time.  It should be about a lifestyle change.  That will not only change you physically but personally.  Sometimes there are underlying issues that need to be resolved.  You cannot expect to go on a diet and loose say "10 lbs." and then stay that way.  It is about consistency.  If you just excercise it won't work, if you just eat right that won't work---it needs to be a combination of both.  Plus personal work.  Journaling emotions and when you eat.  Talking to someone.  Find the issues with the excercise and healthy eatting and then it will become a success.  And do not forget to switch up excercise programs.  Pilates, yoga, strength training, cardio, cycling... Good luck!

An anti-depressant/anti-psychotic prescription. Try prayer. I was on anti-depressants and honestly, they made matters worse. You can try to think yourself better. It worked for me. I just kept praying and telling myself I wasn't sick and I'm drug free, just happy being me. Life is too short to go through it unhappy. I'll keep you in my prayers. Good luck!

It isn't a contradiction in terms.. . A democracy can manifest itself in many ways. If the people choose to have strict limitations on their individual liberties they can do that (theoretically you could have a communist democracy). People can also choose to have a government which wields very little control over individuals.. . It is apparently infinitely debatable the degree to which the state should have influence on the myriad elements of society and individuals.

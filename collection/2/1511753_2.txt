Get him lots of bones to chew on.Get him this new toy that has a recorder inside-it lets you record your voice and it goes off  each time he squeezes it.I think it helps to leave the tv on or whatever you would have on if you were home.. Also, a playmate would be nice if you can afford it.They also like to be near something that smells like you so leave something with your scent on it for them to chew on.

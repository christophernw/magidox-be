It's legal to buy or publish 'Mein Kampf' in most European countries, but quite a few ban it as part of legislation against glorifying or promoting Fascism. . . Officially, Mein Kampf cannot be purchased in Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland, but the book is readily available in Russia, Romania and the UK (where it sells a regular 3,000 copies annually).

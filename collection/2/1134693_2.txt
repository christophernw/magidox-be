Military arrest!!!  Well that is easy one. The military holds a higher standard then the normal laws that you are thinking of. Such as any cival servant that commits adultery is subject to a fine and time in the blockade. Usually these cases are taken care of through fines but in extreme cases they are prosecuted. To the full extint of the law and codes of conduct.

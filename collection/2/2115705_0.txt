Mostly in textbooks about history you don't see many blacks, so it's a way to bring their history forward.  But, I see no reason to not to integrate all races into history instead of specifying a month for anyone.  In the US we have seen the persecution of many races in and out of our country and this is a place where all of us should be recognized for our accomplishements equally.

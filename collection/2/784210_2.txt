I've always heard they call them "beaners" because racist people will claim all they eat is beans.. I think it's the whole Hispanic race. I don't really know. I've never heard "Lawn Makers" that's a new one to me. Every race as far as I know has a racist name given to them by judgemental punks, I care not to name them all off.

Maybe because of psychological effects. When theories are taught in school, especially in geometry, they are being proved and deemed as a "law" or something. Because of that, students think that theories are something that cannot be contradicted. Just like a fact. I suppose they consider a fact more obvious than a theory but technically the same.

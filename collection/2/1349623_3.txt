I found this in one of my psych textbooks a long time ago...and I kept it because I think it really makes sense: . "Human beings are motivated to maintain a positive picture of themselves, in part by justifying their past behavior, and under certain specifiable conditions, this leads them to do things that at first may seem surprising of paradoxal-for example, to prefer people and things for whom they have suffered to people and things they associate with ease and pleasure."

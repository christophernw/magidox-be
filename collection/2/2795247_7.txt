that's why sometimes if someone asks my religion...i am often hesitant to answer "Christian"...i don't agree with views...and a lot of Christians will say that I am not Christian because of this...i do not see anything wrong with being gay...i think some people hide there small, unaccepting minds behind a veil of religion just as others hide behind sheets.. . **oh, boy am I going to be hated on here.

stretch everyday and yoga would also help . and exercise for like 1 hr everyday to lose weight. eat but not as much make sure to have a good breakfast though and dont eat as much junk food. stretch when there is a commercial(when watching tv)get a good night sleep so you wont get tired during ballet classes ask teacher for advice remember to always point your toes, your movements have to be smooth.always do the best you can.if you are tired dont give up until you are done with your ballet classes.practice the movements u think u need too improve when u have extra time.maybe have your teacher teach u alone a few times a week.do solos for performances (it helps you improve a little faster)do yoga a few times a week too.

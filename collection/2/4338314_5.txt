I think it is starve fever and feed the cold. Colds are bugs viruses that can't be cured they have to be passed from one to the next or at least through a person. (LIKE 24 HR BUG).There are no antibiotics for them you just deal with them. Fever is usually a syptom of an infection that can be cured with antibiotics (like an ear infection). I know you can get really nautious and throw up if you eat dairy with a fever( spoils in your stomache). so I avoid that. To pass the time for kids and adults with a cold you make them "food with love". The kind of homemade soup that always make you feel better. I am not sure if this is the way the saying really goes, it is just what I think. It makes sense.

In Arabic the name 'Lina' can mean noble or tender. If you are referring to it as a short form of the European name 'Alina,' then it has various meanings including bright, beautiful, or kind. In some European countries by adding 'lina' to the end of a name, it turns it into a pet name/affectionate name.

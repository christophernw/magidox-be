And He said to the man, "You listened to your wife and ate the fruit which I told you not to eat.  because of what you have done, the ground will be under a curse.  You will have to work hard all your life to make it produce enough food for you.  It will produce weeds and thorns, and you will have to eat wild plants.  You will have to work hard and sweat to make the soil produce anything until yougo back to the soil from which you were formed.  You were made from soil, and you will become soil again."   (Genesis 3:17-19)

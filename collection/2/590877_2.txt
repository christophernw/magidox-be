Fish don't necessary "swallow" water to get oxygen. They actually absorb it into their blood stream through their gills.. . In water, you can't see it, but there is actually air/oxygen molecules mixed in with the water molecules. When this water/oxygen mixture passes over their gills, the oxygen is absorbed into their blood stream, much the same way that oxygen is absorbed into human's lungs when we breathe air. . . However, don't go trying to breathe in water expecting to breathe like a fish - they certainly have some specialized processes in order to absorb the small amount of oxygen that is in the water.

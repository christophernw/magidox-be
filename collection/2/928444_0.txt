Well, if I had to explain it I'd say it was ED.  Not that I'm a RUSHIE or really anxious to dwell on his... well, problem.  Although I don't think its a surprise to anyone, regardless of the political point of view that they espouse that he'd have trouble "south of the border."  Kind of ironic actually.

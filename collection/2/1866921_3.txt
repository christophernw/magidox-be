The static you are hearing is caused by your spark plugs. Your  power wire to your radio is picking up the noise of the spark. You can either try to run a separate power wire straight to your car battery (with the appropriate fuses inline) or you can purchase a noise filter at any car stereo shop. Running a wire straight to the battery is the best option, as the filters can sometimes not get all of the noise out. Also, make sure your radio chassis is properly grounded to the frame of the car.

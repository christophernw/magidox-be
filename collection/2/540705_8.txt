This is more to prevent you from getting the hicups.  Very simple but takes a while to get used to this good habbit.  Try to chew many many times when you eat.  Meat and fish, about 100 times, vegitables and fruits about 60 times, soft food about 30-50 times.   This helps digest food well so it is easy on your stomach.  You often get the hiccups when your stomach is tired or upset.  So if your stomach is working smoothly, you will have less chance for the hiccups!

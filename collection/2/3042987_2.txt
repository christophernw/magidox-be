Do sports or activities that requires focus, quick analysis of the situation and reacting quickly and appropriately. For example, martial arts. You have to move your body & body parts to avoid damage and counter attacks but at the same time focus on the opponent's weakness, your offense and your approach.. . In my opinion, reflex solely depends on the person's focus.

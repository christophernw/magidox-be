I wouldn't tip anything, because a tip is for service.  If there's a change jar on the counter, toss a few coins in if you feel so inclined.  If you regularly get take-out from one place, and they're super-nice, it might be nice to get them a Christmas gift like a big box of gourmet cookies or something.  You'll probably find it leads to freebies in the future, too!

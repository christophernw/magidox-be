Don't know why you're asking this question, but my guess is that it's the alliteration ("Kabbages & Kings") that has caused the phrase to reverberate in your memory. I see that others have already identified the poem as Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky"--in it, you can find scads of examples of alliteration ("Of SHoes & SHips & Sealing wax...") & other wordplay.

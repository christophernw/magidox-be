I am guessing you are very young.. This is NOT the forum to get good advice.  So ask your parents.  If they are unwilling to answer your questions, ask your family physician or a state licensed family counselor.  Ask him / her for the title of a good text book, or a good video series or audio tape series. If you wish to have personal training,  ask your physician or spiritual advisor for the name of a licensed family therapist trained for sexual therapy.. Whatever you do to pursue this information, do so with your partner so that you arrive at a mutual understanding of each other's needs and desires and how to share this intimacy to edify your partner and yourself.

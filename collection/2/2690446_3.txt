The arrangement of amino acids in proteins causes for countless unique shapes in the proteins.  The function of a protein is determined by its shape, and the shape is determined by the arrangement of the 20 amino acids.  Different amino acids do different things to the shape, such as forming hydrogen bonds and disulfide bridges.  These shapes are what makes each protein unique and give them vastly different functions.

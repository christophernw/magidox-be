Panting can be a sign of distress.  Check your dog's tummy.  If it feels hard, there is something going on and you need to get your dog to a vet right away.. . When a dog doesn't eat and is panting, it is usually a sign of illness...especially if there is no obvious reason for the panting (like a walk or being hot).

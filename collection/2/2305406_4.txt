I remember this from social studies. Rats that had tick/fleas on them caused it. After the flea/tick was done with the rodent, it would latch on the thing that is alive that it is close to. It would then suck your blood. It sometimes ate so much that it would regurgitate back into the person's body. That's how they got the plague. You know what, back then, if they would take a bath everyday, this would not have happened!! Back then, they thought it was cool to brag about how long they haven't taken a bath!!

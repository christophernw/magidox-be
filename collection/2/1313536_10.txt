Market Liberals are those who believe that the government should not interfere with free markets, and that the best way to ensure economic prosperity is to allow the private sector to grow.  They want little government regulation, although recognize that some may be necessary to avoid injustice.  Think for instance the laws that were approved early in the 20th century to deal with issues like child labor and to regulate the maximum hours in a work-day.. . Socialists want the government to control the means of production and dictate where the economy goes.  There are some similarities with communism except that a true socialist believes in democratic elections and decisions reached as result of political processes of discussion.  Communists believe in a dictatorship and have no tolerance for dissent.

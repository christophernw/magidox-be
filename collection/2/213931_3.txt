Since they are rather young, maybe you can go with "creative" play toys like blocks!  Legos are great, too.  They can build stuff and rebuild depending upon their moods.. . Play Dough toys are fun, too. They are great for rainy days and when they have to stay inside.. . Also- if you have nieces- jump ropes are fun. . . If they like to play dress up, there are toys and things you can buy that they can dress up and play act.  . . Coloring books and crayons are fun, too.  Sometimes simple gifts are fun, too!

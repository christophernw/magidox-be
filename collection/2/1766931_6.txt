The difference between a colonoscopy and an endoscopy is that a colonoscopy is when the doctor sticks a scope through your rectem after they sudate you where you won't feel the pain. An endoscopy is when the doctor puts the scope down your throat and look at you orally and they spray that thing in your mouth into the throat and stomach. Plus they numb you up with Max anesthesia and shoot you up with a shot of good medicine to sudate you and put you to sleep where you won't feel the pain.

LOL my cat did the same thing all the time.  I'd get so mad, brand new loaf of bread on the counter, wake up it'd be shredded and no bread left.  My ex boyfriend fixed that, said ok, you want bread here you go.  Gave him bread in his food bowl, sat there for 2 days.  Cat got the hint.  Now I've got a dog that does that if I don't put it away.. . I'd recommend getting a bread box, I've got one of those plastic containers with a lid, holds a loaf of bread.

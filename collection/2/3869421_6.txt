Agnosticism because I really don't know which religion is right.  In heading that path I realized that mine is actually the one true faith because I have 100% certainty and faith in the fact that I really don't know for sure.. . Go ahead.  Ask yourself: could this guy be telling the truth?  See!  You believe I don't know too!  Another convert!  YEAH!

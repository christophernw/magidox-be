The nazis did kill Jews - it's not a fairy tale. It has unfortunately been used by many as an excuse to persecute others. I agree Palestine is also real. But is the state of Israel real? I don't know. But no doubt about it, what the Americans are doing - the terrorist acts they are committing in the middle east are wrong. It's not just the Israelis ya know. People need to stop Bush and his war on oil before anymore people die.

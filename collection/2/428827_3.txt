AHA!!! This is a trick question because there is No "obvious"  solution to spiritual needs. Each person must find the solution to their spiritual needs in their own way. There is no ONE way. Each individual truth is as unique as each individual who seeks it. Instead of relying on a system that a man has told you that was given from God, look within yourself and have the courage and morality to see real truth and work for enlightenment that will show you real truth and real spiritual fulfillment .

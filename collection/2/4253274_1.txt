let me tell you something.... my hair is naturally blonde...and i don't know WHY people dye their hair this color!!! i hate it. dark hair is so much prettier, and you don't have all of those blonde jokes to deal with. i'm not even jk...what pisses me off is when people tell me blonde jks and expect me not to get it....and what pisses me off even more is that i'm usually WAY more intelligent than the people that think that...it's so stupid

Yes of course it is!  LIke all those NIcole Richies and Lindsey Lohans, they need to eat.. Being plus sized is just fine, its a problem when you are obese or anorexic.  I am  a "big girl" but I love the way I look, okay I'll admit I would like to shed some pounds and gain some muscle after havin my child but I am greatful for my body and I wouldn't want to be a unatractive anorexic girl or a great big obese slob.

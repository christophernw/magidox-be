This really should be a very long answer. However I will try and give you a very short summary that will not cover all the reasons.. . 1. After WWI Germany was split up and placed in a huge economical depression. They were looking for someone to blame.. . 2. The Jews were and easy target. Even though most Jews in Germany were as poor as everyone else, there were several owned Jewish business and rich ppl. Ironical Hitler was backed by several rich Germans.. . 3. Hitler needed someone to blame to stir hatred which is the easiest emotion to twist.. . 4. Hitler felt that one "Pure" arions were the Master Race and that anyone else was inferior. Which is also ironic because he was part Jewish.. . 5. Hitler did not limit his hatred to just Jews, they were the bulk of ppl he murder.

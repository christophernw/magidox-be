A prediction is when you are predicting/ using information to try and anticipate what will happen next looking forward.. An inference is when you are drawing a conclusion about what the author thinks but isn't actually saying by reading between the lines.  For instance, if someone were to statements criticizing the current policies in Iraq, you might infer that they disapproved of the president's handling of the situation.  They didn't actually say it but you might draw that out of the other things they said.

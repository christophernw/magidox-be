According to the Bible (the recognized authority on God and Sin), homesexuality and abortion are sins!  JUST AS ARE divorce, saying the Lords name in vain, stealing in all forms, and so on and so on and so on!!. God will judge everyone in their or His time!  . Pray for those who are so closed minded, as they surely do not look with the same eyes as Jesus.  Jesus did not run from "sinners"  THANK GOD!!!  Instead He ran TO THEM!!   He would tell them that they are sinning...but he would LOVE THEM!   . The Bible also says "for all have sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God"!   . Be true to your heart...do what is right....love everyone that you can...even the judgemental ones!. Don't be angry at them...they are blind!!. Peace...

I'm going to guess on this and I'm sorry if it's wrong.  This is out of the christian bible... god gave man a list of things that were clean to eat and things that were not.  I think it went something like if it has cloven hooves and chews it's cud then it's clean, otherwise it's a no no.  If you'd like I could look it up.  I think I remember where it is in there.

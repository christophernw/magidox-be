Nonsense!  If you want to  be husband and wife, you go over to the States on a tourist visa .... get married post haste ... send in the papers to the immigration, and bob's your uncle!  You can't be deported even if your tourist visa has expired IF you've filed your papers with the INS ... if you're married to a U.S.citizen you WILL get your green card ... unless of course you're a terrorist or hardened criminal .... loads of people have done it ... while you're waiting on the green card, you can always get pregnant ... give birth here ... and hey presto, you're the mother of an American citizen ... :). . And oh Angela, you CAN go back and visit abroad if you want to ... while you're waiting on your green card, you just have to fill in another form saying you want to go abroad, and return to the U.S. ... again,that will cost you a few bucks, but well worth it ...

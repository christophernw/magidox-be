We do a program called Partners in Education  where local businesses help out with donations or our wish lists every year. WalMart ( I know....evil) is a real big help to us.  Sometimes attorneys offices are looking for a tie to the community and they will sponsor or help out in ways that others can't.  Try local not national branches of banks as well.

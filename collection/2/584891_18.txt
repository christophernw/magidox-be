We don't really know the *true* reason.  This will probably come about in Book 7.  There are many theories on this.  My personal one is that it's the best way for DD to protect Harry.  He know has a spy in V's camp that is very well trusted and is in a position to deal real damage when Harry needs it.. . I wrote a long thing about it a while back, but DD can still advise Harry through the dead and through the paintings in his old office.

Maugham gave a kind of interesting answer in his book "The Razor's Edge."  He used the simile of weaving rugs (probably a thought taken from Greek mythology, where the three Fates were represented as a spinner, measurer, and a cutter, determining the length of a  life.)  Maugham writes that the pattern of each person's life is intricate, beautiful, valuable and unique, just like an oriental rug.  So each life has its own meaning, independent of others.  You do the weaving; you determine the pattern. "Timshel," thou mayest, as Steinbeck wrote.

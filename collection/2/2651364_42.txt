It's not really their fault. Some portion of their bible (I think) says that they have to go around "witnessing" (ie trying to convert you) if they want to be get into heaven. Yeah, it's pretty irritating. . . It's also a teensy bit contradictory with the whole "Do unto others..." bit. Do you think they like it when other people try to convert them? Particularly by telling them that they are going to burn in hell unless they accept a fundamentally illogical belief structure RIGHT NOW? I would have to say, probably not. So, quit doing it unto me.

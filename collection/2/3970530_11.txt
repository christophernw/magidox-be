I use daily disposables, I tend to leave them in a few days at a time.  They weren't acuvue though the were the cheapest brand available.  If they made me uncomfortable, I would take them out, use eye drops and just use glasses for a while.  If you definitely have the right prescription, maybe you are rubbing your eyes too hard and its giving you a headache.  What you should try is just roll your eyes, very briefly.  Or get one of those special eye masks with the blue gel, available at boots.  Best advice though is to tell your optician.

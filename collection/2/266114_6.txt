"Lion Spider," you said it.. When you "call" yourself white, you "call" us black.. When you "call" blacks colored, your not. . But when blacks come in shades, you tan instead of except yourself and others.. That's a fact set and made by your American "white" society.. . Blacks are aware of their shades, we just can't (racism) and choose not to play them out in this society (our choice).. . I have nothing against irish descent, just a** ppl like "Lion Spider.".

it is islamic law there.. . regarding jenova' post:. .   in india no muslims are procecuted. even after the riots they keep creating and partition of the country they caused.. .   IF IT WAS TRUE THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SECOND LARGE POPULATION OF MUSLIMS IN INDIA. NOR THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MANY REFUGEES FROM NEIGHBOURING ISLAMIC COUNTRIES.. .   we have  bagladeshis , many Afagan refugees and even some pakistani regugees. pakistani came when some years ago they were facing problems in kerachi riots. . .   at the time of partition we had 14% muslim population. only a small no of muslim migrated there. and we have AT LEAST 20% MUSLIM POPULATION TODAY. in kashmeer they systematically killed hindus or forced many of them to leave the state. kashmeeri hindus are refugees in their own country . . .   hindus never procecuted anybody in the history of 10,000 years. its other way round here.

OF COURSE WE GET ALONG!!!!  Just look at aussies and new zealanders when they're overseas..even if they don't know eachother it's like they're best friends, I ended up being best friends with a new zealander that I met by chance in london (I'm Aussie)...But we're like family, just like you can rip the piss out of your little brother, or your wierd uncle, aussies and kiwi's rip the piss out of each other, but, also like family, if anyone other than family starts ripping the piss out of one of us, the other jumps straight to their defense...yep, we love eachother, even if kiwi's do have intimate affairs with sheep...eeewe!!

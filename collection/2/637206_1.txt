If you're qualified and well-resourced, opening a school in Dubai would be a great idea. Dubai is in a huge economic boom right now, and is only going to grow in the next few years. Major companies and investors are sending families there and those kids all need a place to go to school. It would be an excellent business and educational idea, but please go heavy on the educational aspect of your business...nothing worse than a school that opens its doors for the sake of "business."

when you are a baby in the Episcopal church at your baptism your parents and god parents take vows for you. After taking confirmation classes that explain the church and it's belief then you are able to confirm those vows if it is your wish as a mature person ( usually 13 years old and up ) as to whether it is your choice to join the church,.,, thus confirming the vows that were taken for you.

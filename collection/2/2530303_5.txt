Because some people have traumatic experiences as being raped, for instance.. Then you have people, who have "accidents" and know that they won't be able to cope with a family life because they have no money, no family stability and who'd rather prevent a child from suffering.. You can't always judge people's deeds and actions.. Wait for you to find yourself in a difficult situation, without any help around to judge!. Stop those awful generalization! A woman is not just a womb!

Why are you only talking about developing countries? Developed countries have per capita pollution emission much higher than developing countries. In fact the world's largest polluter is USA.. . Anyways for the betterment of all of us, there is a need to adopt Kyoto Protocol urgently by all countries.. Find viable non-conventional resources for energy such as solar, wind, bio-gas energy.. Have  stringently implemented waste disposal norms.. Plant more trees, save mangroves and prevent coastal areas from being commercially exploited (We all saw what happened because of this...Tsunami Disaster, Katrina...losses could have been minimized).

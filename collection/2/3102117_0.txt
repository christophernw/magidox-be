This is typical of commodity type products.  Items where the typical consumer is not able to discern or is unaware of product differences, they often use price as the selection criterion.  Companies use advertising to try to educate customers as to why their product is better (ex: cleans the engine).  Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.

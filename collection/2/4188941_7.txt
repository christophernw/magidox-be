we are supposed to think of sex as this forbidden thing that no one should see until they want a baby.  Ciggarettes although deadly was formerly considered to be fine (look at commercials for smokes featuring cartoon characters).  Now we are being more health consoius and smoking will someday be as acceptable as looking at boobs.

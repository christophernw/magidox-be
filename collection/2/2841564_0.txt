A couple of questions for you...  Did it read normal before the oil change and did they (you) use the same viscosity oil as you had before?  Does it read normal at higher RPM's? Thin or diluted oil will cause a low reading. BUT Unless you have run the motor low on oil (or it has many many miles on it) it is likely the sending unit.  Have the pressure checked with a mechanical gauge.  If the gauge is reading corrrect then you may have very thin and diluted oil OR have bad main bearings.  A clogged pickup screen usually shows up at higher RPM's so likely that is not it.   I have a stock 1950 dodge car with a "soft crank" that reads zero at idle and has for 30 years.  The motor is still getting oil but your main bearing clearance sets the pressure reading.  Worn bearings (or in my case the crank) will allow the gauge to read low because there is excess oil flow from the bearing areas.  I overhauled a small block chevy that the owner demanded very tight clearances and the gauge would read over 100 PSI on startup and carry 65-70 at idle.  Clearance was extremely tight on that one.

The Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) system and valve feed engine crankcase vapors back into the intake to be burned again. Before emissions controls, the crankcase was simply vented directly to the atmosphere. So when you open up the dipstick hole it could throw the PCV pressure/vacuum balance off enough to stall the car, but I've never tried it myself. I'll have to try it and see if my car stalls when I pull the oil dipstick out. You could check your PCV valve to see if it still rattles when you shake it. It's an emissions maintenance item and I simply clean them every so often, but at 100,000 miles you might install a new PCV valve if recommended for your car.

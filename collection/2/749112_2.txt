In theoretical work, such as theoretical physics and cosmology, researchers are limited to mathematical proofs. Occasionally an experiment may be performed or an observation may be made that indirectly strengthen or weaken a theoretical hypothesis.. . Einstine did not live long enough to see all of his theories tested..one of them is being tested right now using the most spherical balls ever made. They have been launched into orbit and will hopefully tell us more about gravity and space.

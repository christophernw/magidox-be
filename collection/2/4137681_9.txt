Since you've listed this under etiquette, I'm going to assume you're talking about teaching children manners.  The best way to teach manners is to be a good example.  Don't use a nasty tone of voice when speaking to people, say "please," "thank you" and "excuse me" no matter who you are talking to.  You get the picture.

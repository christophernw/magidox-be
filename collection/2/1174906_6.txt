It is because the sun is composed of hydrogen atoms which combine to form Helium atoms this reaction is called nuclear fussion. This reaction produces very hot temperature which enables the reaction to continue. . But after a very long time the sun will stop shinning because hydrogen atoms will be finished all together. It will take about 500 million years ahead.

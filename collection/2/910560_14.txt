Hey, but after ALL you said about religion and the christian. faith....the God who we know in through His Son Jesus Christ REALLY LOVES YOU!!!!  At 15 you should be thankful. that you can have a full life ahead with an eternal purpose.. You don't have to believe in Him just yet but at least get to know Jesus before you start "nailing Him to the cross". And as you get to know Him....start asking Him some of the. questions that you have on your mind or heart. From just. your question alone..... I understand.....let me give you . and insight .....True Christianity is about a relationship with Jesus.....Religion is all about a belief in God by . good works.

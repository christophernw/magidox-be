Force simply means amount of quantity vector (physically) that cause a body with mass to accelerate. Force as a vector can act at various direction affecting the overall movement of a body. It is described in the unit Newton (N). To understand more, get to know the three principles of the famous Newton's Law. Generally, force can be used widely in terms like acceleration, gravity or anything else concerning movement. force is usually calculated the same way we count acceleration, that's velocity over time.

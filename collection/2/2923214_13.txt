It is certainly NOT the sound of your blood. If it were:. 1. you would hear a pulse, not a steady whoosh. 2. it would be louder if your heart was beating faster, say after exercise, which it is not. . It is most likely due to the fact that the shell captures and focuses certain frequencies of ambient noise from the environment that your brain would otherwise filter out as being "background".. . (Your brain filters most background noise out. For instance, are the birds singing now? Are you sure? Can you hear them? And how come you can hear someone talk to you in a crowd when the noise of all the voices in the crowd is louder than them?)

Seeing a psychologist. About 6 weeks of cognitive behavoral therapy is just as effective as medication without the awful side effects and it starts working right away and you won't have to switch meds every few months like you might with medication. Also try change your diet. Eat healthy, get enough sleep and exercise. . . Don't bother with St. John's wort. It doesn't help clinical depression and is a medication with it's own set of side effects. It can cause complications when taking other medication for example it reduces the effectiveness of birth control pills. It's not a good thing and you may as well take prozac if you are really depressed not just a bit down.

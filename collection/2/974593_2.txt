This is a good question. Critics of the guest worker program proposed by GWB argue that it penalizese skilled documented workers as it effectively takes them out of "the green card race". We have heard comments such as "erwarding bad behaviour and so on". The reality is that the path to a GC is not easy, whether under the proposed guest worker program or under H/L visa category. Therefore, the impact will be negligble in this respect. These programs will probably run parallel to each other with little over lap.

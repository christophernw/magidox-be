The answer is in the wings. Wings are designed to go one way aerodanamically.  Look at airplanes. Have you ever seen one reverse?  They can do that only in the ground, and even then they have to use their motors..  The fly has to perch, physically turn around using its little legs, then fly back if they have to reverse direction.

Shut up and listen. Really just tell your friend that Gods people will be known by their works. Don't hate him, just listen and watch.  Christians, can be annoying, i know i am one :). debate with him, challenge him. ready the bible yourself and question him. As iron sharpens iron so a man sharpens the countanence of his friends.. . Have patience.

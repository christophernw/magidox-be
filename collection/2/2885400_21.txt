We wash them because they collect body soil and who knows what else. Think about it, you dont wash a towel for say about a month. Do you know how much bacteria and dirt collect on that towel, and Im pretty sure you dry your face with it. Do you want feet and butt bacteria on your face after you think you are clean, I think not.

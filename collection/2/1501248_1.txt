That previous answer is good. Basically an atom stores a tremendous amount of energy. Particularly for it's size. You've seen those huge power plants that belch thick white clouds of smoke into the air right? Imagine producing multiple times that amount of energy and only requiring a fraction of the space. Like running your car off of a battery the size of a nine volt. The problem is there is no real clean, effective, and most important "cost efficient" way to produce it.

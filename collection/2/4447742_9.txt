No it's not laziness, otherwise they wouldn't have taken the time to sign up for Answers and post the question.. . Some people don't know how to use search directories very well yet.. Some people are new to the Internet.. . Some questions are asked by very professional people who want direct answers from individuals, not from research on the Internet.. . And have you ever got lost on the Internet searching for information? I have - it sucks! Some sites make you register or sign up or pay for information and they blast you with pop-ups and "You've Just Won an Apple iPod" when all you've won is a sorry web site tricking you into a survey and there is no prize - or laziness - in that!

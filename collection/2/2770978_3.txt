Phuket for a honeymoon...are you looking to have a threesome?. If so then it would be a good place to go, otherwise forget it. If you like Thai food and architecture spend a few days in Bangkok seeing the temple etc, and then fly to Koh Samui and relax on the beach or the other way around. If you decide on Bali book into one of the nicer hotels in Nusa Dua, 5 star hotels there are very cheap but you wont find anywhere near as much architecture to see there, its more of a resort area.

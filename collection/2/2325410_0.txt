Depends upon which f-150 you have.... . The one called a f-150 heritage (looks like a 97-03 model) probably needs to have the throttle body cleaned or needs to find the air leak if you are having idle problems. But idle is non adjustable cause it uses a Idle motor for idle.. . The new body style f-150s, forget it..uses drive by wire... computer controls everything including basic opening... do the checks above if you have idle concerns.

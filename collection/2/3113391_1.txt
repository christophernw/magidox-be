I do this to mine all the time. After you wash it and while it is still wet, put it in a ponytail and put hair ties in the ponytail every inch all the way to the end. Let it dry like that and your hair is almost straight. Lasts for days. You can adjust the poof by how tight the ponytail is and how far apart the hair ties are.

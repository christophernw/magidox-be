I agree with the first post.  All, starts from within.. . Look at our oceans, parks and I truly have never considered it, but lately on the news about elephants in the zoos being in danger of extinction.  Wow.  That really blew my mind.  I never thought of it!!!  But, when I heard it, it all made sense.. . How would we, people like to be confined to an area similar to what we are accustomed but be closed in?  They need their natural environment.. . Of late, I myself, have been turning to "Alternative" products to do my part in supporting our environment and educate people on the harmful products we personally use and the chemical manufacturers we support by using their unhealthy products.

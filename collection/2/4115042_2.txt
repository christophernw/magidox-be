Stupid is relative.  I agree that people who spell incorrectly and use terrible grammar seem to be uneducated, lazy and most likely have very low self esteem.  However, I try to imagine reasons why people, especially on this site, come off like the sterotypical hillbilly, redneck, moron etc.  Here are the reasons I use to keep myself from going mad:. 1. English is not their native language. 2. They only have three fingers, their spell check is broken and they are blind. 3. They are three years old. 4. Their brain is slowly being destroyed by alien slugs, or syphillis.. 5. They have been in a box for twenty years and have had no contact with the ooutside world or other human beings (this one explains the content of some of the questions as well).. . So, by remembering these excuses, I can keep my anger and shame for these people under control.  However, if you read some of my answers, you'll see it doesn't always work.

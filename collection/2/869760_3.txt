I think a douch bag may be an actuall term for those little wax coated bags you used to find in public bathrooms for, you know, a douch bottle or used pad.  I think somehow it morphed into a slang term that guys use to call each other, uhh...a nasty douch bag related name?  lol  I have no freakin clue.

Your partner may be a carrier, in which he may not break out with any visible sores, but would still have the virus and pass it to anyone whom he has sexual contact with. Go to another doctor and get a second opinion. You could also ask your doctor if it's possible for you to have had it for several years without an outbreak. Or, call annoymously to the doctor's office and ask to speak with a nurse. She would know as well.

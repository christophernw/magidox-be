The Christian idea of revenge originates from the fact that especially the Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus. This also explains the extreme hatred against Jews in the medieval world that has to some extent survived until today. The fact that the Holy City was captured by the Muslims inspired the idea of revenge against the Islam world (starting with the crusades). This element of revenge was present in Christian doctrine until very recently, and still survives to some extent today.

maybe you saw these magic tricks wherein the magician pulls the head of the chicken..this is not true, chickens cannot live without a head. it is purely a trick wherein the magician hides a fake head of a chicken and acts like he can pull the head of the chicken wherein reality the magician only hides the head below the chicken's breast

AMEN. . If everyone is so scared about the sanctity and value of marriage being destroyed, why not outlaw divorce? I know a myriad of divorced couples. I know gay people, I know religious people, I know religious gay people, and I know that marriage is between the people getting married. Just because 2 people are of different sexes doesn't make them more committed, more loyal, happier in a marriage! Hey, I am a spiritual person, I know what the bible says. Back in 30 A.D., things were a little different. The bible also says that women shouldn't ever wear makeup and they should keep their hair in braids. Back in the day, this made sense for many reasons, as did sex stipulations on marriage. The bible was written by humans. Not God.

They do if they have to, but nobody WANTS to be uncomfortable. If a white person, a black person, a latino/a, an asian person, or anyone else can get better work, surely they would take it. Right?. . I am white, but when I was a kid I worked in my uncle's corn and peanut fields occasionally to earn some spending money. It was hot, dirty, uncomfortable work but it paid much better than mowing lawns. When I was in college I worked two summers in a shipyard, which was even hotter, dirtier, and more uncomfortable, but it paid really well. When I graduated I found work that was not hot or dirty, only occasionally uncomfortable, and sometimes stressful, but it paid REALLY well. That is why I went to college in the first place really.. . Race does not necessarily have anything to do with it.. . Those who are afraid of immigrants fear that they will work for VERY low pay and that this will depress the wages of EVERYONE. Many are also afraid of cultural pollution, but I really can't explain why since I don't understand that one myself.

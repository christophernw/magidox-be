I think that everyone is essentially afraid of the unknown, so by confessing the other person is afraid that they might not truly know the other person. this fear pushes people away. humans don't like to be vulnerable! so confessions bring truth to a relationship and sometimes the truth scares the other person, but the truth ultimately binds. truth is the only thing that humans can depend on.

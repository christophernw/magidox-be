Blood flowing through the body warm/cools it.  Ever notice when its hot outside, and you get hot, your blood veins are more visable.  They are moving near the surface of the skin to try to release heat to cool the body along with sweat.. . Also when your cold, the blood vessels move away from the skin in order to retain heat.  Thats what you loose color in your skin.

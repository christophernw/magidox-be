I think flying the Confederate flag says one thing: "I consider myself a Confederate. An American, but a resident of the south, and my southern heritage is what matters most to me". I don't think these people realize that the men who fought for the Confederacy committed treason. Had we lost the American Revolution, not only would America not exist as we know it, but the founders we admire would've been tried for treason. They all would have hung from ropes for saying the things they said. We won, but 90 years later a group of Americans decided to change the country again. They seceded from the Union, formed their own nation, with their own president, and fought us hand to hand on American soil. In the end, America came out on top. The Confederate flag has nothing to do with slavery. It's not about "white pride" or "southern pride", it's about a Nation, a nation that no longer exists. Do any other countries continue to fly the flag they used before a revolution (it's a legit question, I honestly don't know)? I don't THINK they do. Lincoln could've tried every souther general, the President of the Confederacy, and countless othere "Confederates" with treason. By American law, they all could've been hanged. He didn't. Lincoln pardoned every one, allowing them to live. How did the south thank him? By placing their OLD flag on every bumper sticker, notebook, baseball cap and hanging it on every flagpole they can get their hands on. I am all for free speech, but I think the past needs to be put to rest. I don't agree with immigrants pleading for civil rights, while waving their home flags. I am all for heritage, but there is a limit.

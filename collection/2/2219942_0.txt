Dan kennedy said it best.. Get up out of you seat, and if you can, walk around, use your hand gesturers as if you were talking to a friend.. That way you sound more conversational and animated by using your hands. You may need a head set to do this, but it does work.. If you sit in one place you can't sound like you're alive as if you were moving around and talking at the same time.

The sun (and all other stars) don't "burn" in the usual sense of the word. Instead they all convert the element hydrogen to helium. This process is called nuclear fusion and is the same thing that happens with a hydrogen bomb. The sun is a continuous hydrogen bomb that's been "exploding" for the last 4.5-billion years!

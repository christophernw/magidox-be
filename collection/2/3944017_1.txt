erm, i think it;s both. . th wind blows , so wave crest andd troughs are formed. and seen. yet again, it;s the currects under the water that actually cause the water to "move ". .  in actual fact, water waves are tansverse. meaning that they dont move . so if your ball is thrown out at  sea on a beach. you'd notice it;;; bob up and down but it doesnt seem to get any closer. . . btw gravationall and wind, i;d say gravational; effect is a better answer. .  hpe this helps .

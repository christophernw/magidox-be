1) Not enough pay for the degrees that you have to have and the potential in student loans accrued.  . . 2)  Everyone blames you for student failure, even if the student doesn't do anything in school.. . 3) Too many teachers retiring.  This is coupled with the relatively small population of Gen X'ers, so not as many people to become teachers.. . 4) Stigma against it.  There is the common misconception around the phrase "Those who can't, teach."  It isn't true, but it scares off some of those people who would make excellent teachers.

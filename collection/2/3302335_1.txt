Watch tv.  My dad watched the Flintstones when he first came to Canada and he learned a lot that way.  Honestly, cartoons are very direct in teaching English, and you can be guaranteed they're speak proper english, not like on comedy shows or anything.  TV programming for the evening is aimed at people who speak colloquial, or "slang" English.. . Surround yourself with friends and people.  Listen to how they talk.  Go to a cafe or casual restaurant and listen to other people talking amongst themselves.. . Read the newspaper or, if you don't mind, read children's books.  . . Good luck!

God is only one  abstract word and  is used to make categories between people and to divide them,although I respect those who believe and I like to read about ancient cults  to know the ancients' past convictions but I always  remember the proverb: divide to conquer, and religion is the best for that quote.. I stopped beleiving when I found out that religion is for wars and used as a tool to stir  people emotions to kill each other

No way.. In Asia, most of the homosexuals are poor, less educated or illiterate, or lower middle class who are like plumbers and stuff.. The rich people never show if they're gay. In Asia, you've got to either be straight or a closet gay if you want to be sucessful and liked.. Or be an entertainer and make your homosexual identity like your screen identity that you carry around.. Tough, but that's the way the world is. I hate seeing homosexuals being discriminated upon. Why should their sexual identity be a hinderance to their success?!

Oh...I understand what you mean..... I personally am not "thin" at all....I'm a very "chubby" person...even though I'm not fat in America...but I'm considered fat from where I'm from, which is Asia.. I can tell you why.... They think thinner girls look better and weaker making the guys feel good about themselves.. I hate that too...I try to lose weight because I'm fat for asian standard and I want to go out with someone from where I'm from...so I try to lose weight but I personally don't like it..... I wish there were guys out there that do like "big women".... But I believe there are...just have to look hard.. Good luck. ^^

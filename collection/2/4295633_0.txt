Synchro motors are usually operated in pairs (that remain synchronized!).  For example a synchro motor may be rotated many degrees when the wheel on the bridge is repositioned to steer a large ship.  A second synchro motor in the steering gear room connected to the first motor senses an imbalance in its electric circuitry and rotates the same amount to duplicat movement of the wheel.  The second synchro is then used to control the steerin gear engine controls until the rudder is repositioned as desired by the bridge.

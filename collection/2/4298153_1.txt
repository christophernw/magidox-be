Two notes, all churches are made by men including the ones created by the apostles.  All are man made Churches, but the question is does God reside there as well.. . The word Catholic comes from two Greek words, kata holos, which means all embracing or according to the whole.  So you say you believe in a holy church that embraces all.  In doing so you are explicitly rejecting division.  It can also mean "according to the whole," which would mean you are rejecting those beliefs that are decided by one segment of Christianity instead of in a joint process of all groups together.. . I know this because I belong to the part of the Church that still speaks Greek (not Methodist).

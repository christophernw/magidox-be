make a standard solution of some kind and put some of this inside the material and knot it, put it in a beaker of water of known volume for a certain period of time and them remove it.  Then titrate or spectroscopically analyse the water in the beaker.. . This works well with dyes for spectroscopy and starch/iodine solutions for titrations.

There are these options:. . 1. Jet Airways . (Highly Recommended). . 2. Spice Jet . (unless they serve spices to the passengers and make them). . 3. Indian Airlines . (they treat passengers in first class like royals & get a lifevest and a airmask if an emergency and economy class passengers gets no lifevests and no airmasks & they treated them like crap). . 4. Air India . (Never will take it. Gave our family such a hard time at depature & arrival in India.. . 5. Kingfisher Airlines . (best of all is they serve free beer and also serve foergin beer, too)

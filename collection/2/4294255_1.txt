Stem cell is the overarching umbrella term which includes cells inside the bone marrow. There are two types of stem cells, embryonic and adult. The controversial one is the embryonic because you have destroy an embryo to obtain such cells.  Adult stem cells are divided into several categories, two of which are found inside bone marrow.  One is called hematopoietic and the other mesenchymal.  The former generates the blood cells, red and white, and the latter generates the cell necessary for bone, cartilage, and muscle formation.

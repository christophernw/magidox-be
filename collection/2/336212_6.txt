Because it is. When you have a group of people like the palestinians who  promote suicide bombings on innocent people in hotels, buses, restaurants etc.it is self defense when you retaliate.  You dont know who was on that beach.  I know the palestinians have been through a lot but it is really hard to sympathize with a group of people who defend themselves by killing innocents all the time.  And look who they voted for, Hamas.  Live by the sword and die by the sword.

That depends on how you define the verb "to do.". . For some it might mean "work" as in the physics definition of work.  You have exert a force against an object.  Hmmm, interesting enough just by existing we are exerting a force against the earth in collusion with gravity.  Ok then.. . In the end. I think it really is impossible to do nothing.  Which is what makes it so annoying when people say that they're not doing anything!

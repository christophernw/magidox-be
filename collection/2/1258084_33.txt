You must have read the other answers by now, I hope you find this one to be more informative.  God will forgive anything you can repent sincerely of.  Repentance is truly being sorry and never wanting to commit more sin, especially the same ones over and over.  . . That said, if you have Christ as your savior, you eventually walk with Him to the point of not wanting to sin against anyone you love, anyone...especially Christ.  Furthermore, if you do get to heaven and stand in the presence of the Lord, you must account for every idle word, and deed.  Do you want to sit and give excuses to the One who saved you and gave you eternity with Him in a place that will be beyond your greatest dreams?. . You do not have to be bad to go to hell, just lost and deceived.  In my opinion, also scared or lazy.  It is scary at first to give up the life you know in this fallen world and it seems easier to just go on in ignorance of the gift He offers.  Neither option is better than just giving up what this world offers, because in the end you have pain and disappointment either way, and with Jesus, you are never alone.. . So ask yourself, why do I want to get away with...whatever it is you want to experience.  Is it worth an eternity of damnation, because you will only have your reward here on earth if you choose the wrong path.  Seriously, what do you have to lose in the end?

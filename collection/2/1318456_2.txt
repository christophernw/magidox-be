It is best to eat 5 or 6 small meals a day to keep your blood sugar stabalized and also to prevent you from over eating. Buy 2% milk and drink 4oz. before each meal, and that will also curb your appetite. And If you want to miss one of those meals because you just don't have time to fix anything, you can also have another glass of milk. This helps to stabalize your blood sugar when you just don't have time for that extra meal.

Okay. For one, you do not mix opinions with other things. That is just harmful on your end just as much as the recieving end. For another, why do you reach out to cause conflict? That is surely not the way to go, but it is your choice. All I can say is have fun doing what ever you want to do (This goes for everyone). Cheers!

Dry ice has a much lower freezing temperature than normal ice. By using dry ice on a dent in a car, it actually causes the metal in the area to contract, which is how the dent "pops" back into place. Say heat was used instead - this might cause that dent to get bigger. Heat causes expansion, while cold causes contraction.

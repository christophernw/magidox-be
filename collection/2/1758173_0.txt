Adenine and guanine are what we call purines whereas thymine and cytosine (and you could add uracile) are pyrimidines. The main difference is the molecular structure of these nucleobases. Purines are made of two cycles and Pyrimidine are each made of one cycle. In the DNA and RNA molecules pyrimides pair with purines.

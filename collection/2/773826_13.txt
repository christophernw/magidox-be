Why would you want to with the world of today?. . I think it sucks too and I'm hating it more and more each day.  I do have a way to vent though.  I have guns and lots of ammo and I take pictures of people I really hate to the rifle range and I shoot them in the face.  No one gets hurt and it feels pretty good!

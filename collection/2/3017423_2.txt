The only way the body can heal itself of viral infections is to produce antibodies towards the virus or part of the virus. The antibodies actually coat the virus shell and prevent it from infecting other cells. Antibodies are created by T-cells, a form of white blood cells. Often, once infected, we never get rid of the virus, but antibodies take care of enough of them that the sypmtoms go away..such as many herpes virus...cold sores reoccur when are immune system weakens. If you have ever had chicken pox, you still have the virus, alive and active. Under normal circumstances, you will not come down with symptoms..but if your immune system weakens, you can come down with a very painful case of Shingles. Retrovirus and flu virus are more apt to be destroyed by antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that have very specific shapes. The shape will cover certain parts of the virus to destroy its ability to infect new cells. Cells can only be infected by virus at RECEPTOR SITES...if the virus can not longer plug into the receptor site, due to being covered with anitbodies, it can no longer infect a cell. I hope this helps.

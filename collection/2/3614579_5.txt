1. Some cats actually prefer to be inside most of the time.. 2. If you can't be bothered to have a litter tray in the house, in some out-of-the-way spot, then you are not providing for your cat's welfare.  Modern 'clumping litter, if deep enough, will prevent odours.  (Incidentally, what happens when your garden area is frozen solid in winter?). 3. Cats  are not just furry ornaments that can be ignored (in fact, your cat doesn't want to be ignored!), so maybe you are not cut out to own a pet.  Nothing to be ashamed of -  some people are, some are not.  Pets  take up time,  patience and understanding are required, vet fees have to be paid, etc., so have a big think and if you are not prepared to be a little more understanding of your cat's wishes, then why not consider letting it go to some one who will have the time and interest to accommodate its needs.  And you will get some sleep, too!

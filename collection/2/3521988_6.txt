Why don't you people let it die what these people and Clinton have done is have affairs and if you go back you will find most presidents had mistresses. Whether this wrong or right it really is not the public business as long they do their job. More likely if you looked in your congress and senate you find a few more who have had extramarital affairs.I'M tired of hearing this kind of CRP most of it is dead and gone so leave it alone one these men is going to run for the Republican party and my guess it will be   McCain I'M not voting for him probably because I have to wait and see who runs for the Democrats I had a lot of respect for McCain but lost some of it when he became a flunky for Bush he is to good a man to do that.

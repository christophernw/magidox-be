Marijuana and its consumption is misuse of Gn.1:29-30 and not following it. Why do you not chew upon poison ivy? because it harms you and so does marijuana and other mentioned plants. So, God created plants that both benefit and harm humans. It is upto us humans to use our discretion to select rights and wrongs. The 'wrongs' today are termed today as illegal. Its illegal to harm someone, and also buying or selling things that harm someone, marijuana is one of them.

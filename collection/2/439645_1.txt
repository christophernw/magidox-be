I believe that OIL was the reason. Secondly, a great dislike for Saddam Hussein and his horrible accomplishments.. Thirdly, a deep jealousy that many of these upstanding world leaders hadn't done these things themselves. Thus, the various countries felt outright indignant about someone, anyone else doing the "stuff", that they should have been able to get away with. God Bless.

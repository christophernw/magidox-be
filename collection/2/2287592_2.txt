1) my house. I live in the mountains on the top of a canyon so any room I am in in my house, if I look out of the window, it is a "room with a view".. 2) a book by E.M. Forster which was adapted for film in the 1980s.. 3) where I want to stay when I am on vacation.. 4) if you want to get philosophical about it, a "room with a view" could mean a plethora of things- an open mind, the afterlife (if such there is), a new beginning, prison cell (haha), and other things I cannot think of at the moment.

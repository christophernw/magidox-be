My daughter made a cool thing for me when I was having the same problem. She hooked a paper clip onto a rubber band which she put around my wrist. The paper clip seems to ground me and absorbs the electricity so I don't get shocked. I'm not exactly sure how it works, only that it does! Give it a try. It's not very pretty as a bracelet but who cares! I don't get shocked every time I touch something.

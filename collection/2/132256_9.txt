Actually have been wondering the same thing myself.  Only have heard a few media personalities that say "that's an interesting point but.."  I myself will listen, watch and read both sides and often have to concede that they both have a point.  But so many people on both sides seem have got their minds stuck in concrete and can't think outside their mind set. And that's just plain dumb...dang it now I'm making a judgement ;-)

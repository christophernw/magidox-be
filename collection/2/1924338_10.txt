Watch the sugar and sodium intake in your diet. Sugar and sodium are in everything...naturally and man-made. Just try to stay within a healthy limit of both. . Also, lots of water. 64 to 100 oz. a day.. If you don't like drinking water add some lemon for a 'very light' lemonade. Or make drinking your water a game. I try to chug as much as I can when I'm at a long stop light. . Add a light exercise routine and you should be able to reduce your tummy and --even better-- have more energy and feel more healthy.. GOOD LUCK!

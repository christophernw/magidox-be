I just finished taking a class to become a sub, and at least after taking that class it really doesn't seem to be too bad--I'm actually looking forward to it! (But then again, I have a degree in secondary education already)  But I do have a friend, who is not an ed major, who's a sub and he loves it.  Says that for the most part it's the easiest job becuase most teachers plan for a video on sub days.  (Think of when you were in high school, whenever you had a sub usually you had either a filmstrip or a video, right?).  Seriously, I wouldn't worry about it.  Other teachers are there to help too.  Teachers are more than willing to help other teachers.

Correction (Please see final two lines. SORRY FOR THAT!. After cold deformation of a pure metal( or an alloy) the material gets hard (process is called "work hardening",itÂ´s effected by stretching the material structure, the so called crystal lattice) Sometimes the material becomes so brittle that it is breaking under further stress(Just bend a wire and re-bend it at the same point). Recristallization is a thermal treatment to re- compose the structure, an annealing process to reverse the work hardening and make the meterial formable again.. Recristalization needs some time, starts usually in the areas of maximum deformation and is temperature related.. Rule of thumb: Recristalization starting temparature is. ~ 0.4xT (T= Absolute Melting Temperature of Material = Melting Temperature in degrees C + 273)

I think it is important to remember that God has his own will, and fulfills his will in his own due time...not man's.  But don't let that make you feel like he doesn't love you, or that it is a punishment to have disabilities...you'll be blessed for overcoming your challenges.  Eventually, they will receive their limbs back...it just may not be in the time frame that you'd like.  Submit to God's will, and amazing things will happen.

1.)Cut out table scraps. 2.)Feed high quality dog food and measure, according to instructions on bag, for the optimum weight of your dog, not the current weight. Ask your vet for optimum weight.(something that lists meat as top ingredient on the contents list). 3.)Plenty of exercise. Walking should be done every day plus other activities your dog may like. At least 15 minutes twice a day.

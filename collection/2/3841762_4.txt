Since this question is listed in philosophy, I would say it is a toss-up between between the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The number 1 in my mind does not represent one person. What it represents is God, and without God, we would not be here. The number 2 would represent Jesus Christ, as the Second Member of the Godhead. Without Jesus Christ, there would be no way to return to the presence of God, and we would be stuck with the consequences of sin in this life with no way to progress and change. Neither would we have the hope for the resurrection, as we would all die and never be reunited with our physical bodies, as none of us have that information or capability. The number 2 is also important because it represents marriage - you need a man and a woman to have children. Without those two people (as a Christian I would say Adam and Eve) you would not have the rest of the human race. I would also say the number 3 is important because it represents the Godhead (or what Protestants and other Christians would call the Trinity) - and the third member of the Godhead is the Holy Ghost. Without His influence we would never be sure if we had truly encountered truth or not, because it is His function to testify to us of God, Jesus Christ, and eternal truths through simple and peaceful, energetic feelings. I do appreciate the other answers here - and I agree the number 0 is important in mathematics especially.

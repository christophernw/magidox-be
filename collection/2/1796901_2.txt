The advice below is accurate but if you have trouble getting the joint round or rolled evenly at first set the paper (prior to adding the main ingredient) on a dollar bill in a way that will allow you to use the dollar to help you roll (dollar longways). Pinch the dollar around the paper after you add the goods and roll it back and forth with your thumbs and pointer fingers. After doing this a couple of times you get used to the motion and feel of rolling and it will start to come easy to you.

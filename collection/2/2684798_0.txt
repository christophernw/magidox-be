Sometimes a window is too high on a wall to manually open and close the blind (but the blind is needed to block out the sun), so a remote is used to operate the blind.  Sometimes they are needed in conference rooms so the light level can be controlled quickly for best possible viewing of a presentation.  Most importantly, if you are handicapped a remote controlled blind will give you the ability to be self-sufficient.

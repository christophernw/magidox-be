Depends on where you are, what age you're in, what level of education you're teaching, what subject of interest you're planning to have, and other necessary particulars that you'll have to take into account. Above all, are you pursuing for your own personal goals or is it because of others? If financial boost (having a Master's degree)  is what you're aiming at, I say, forget the whole thing; you might as well take up a Master's degree in other sought-after discipline in today's rapid changing business. You know what, even early education does not guarantee a professor of relevant discipline could really make the kids, or even adults, learn; it's the passion for their better future that helps both children and adults grow and develop themselves!

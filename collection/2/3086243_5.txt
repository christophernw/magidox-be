If she is YOUR ASSISTANT, then doesn't matter if she likes you.. Tell her to do her job, if she continues to be rude & obnoxious- then document the behavbior by speaking with her once (with your supervisor present ideally) then have her sign she has been orally warned.  If it continues, give her written warning & 3 strikes she is out!. You have lost control - it is up to you to get it back & quickly = or her behavoir will only get worse.

The theory is (and I'll try to keep this short) that the Bering Straight used to connect with Asia, and some members of ancient Asian nomadic groups crossed it to get the what is now America and into central and south America.  These Asians evolved slightly (due to different climates and food sources) to create what we know as Amerindians today.  The spanish controlled Mexico at one time though, and mixed with these indigenous people.  These people are called mestizo and make up a majority of Mexico's people today.

Go to my question in the health and beauty section of the health and beauty section; it asks for help from 'other mums, or docs or nurses or dermitologists', it asks about stretch marks, as well, mine are from having a child; but all stretch marks are the same, scarring from the skin stretching.  It has quite a few answers so far.  Hope this helps!

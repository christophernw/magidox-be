Okay... this worked on my mom... First of all kinds slowly drop the idea on them and see how they stands on the idea. Then slowly start to earn some money doing something. Also do you already have a phone plan? - if not get one in mind and get the best deal - parents dont like to pay tons - its cheaper if like ur mom already has one. okay the key is to know what your talking about. Before you even think about asking her have the phone you want picked out and the prices ready to go. Then bring it on them all at once. The best way is to offer to buy your actual phone if theyll just take care of the rest. After that hand them some deal packages with prices and let them have a night to think about it. The next day> ask then what they think... Thats how i got my phone... i told this plan to my friend and got a cell phone the next day... I know... im a genius. . . Also throw in some stuff like..."well mom i have to be able to get in touch with you when i go out to my friends and stuff" thats a major part!

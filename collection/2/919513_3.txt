Well wether or not Indian music sounds "Musical" is debatable considering they use an atonal scale to make music! :) However, despite years of training you could get, the only short term fix for making your voice sound better on recordings are a few little tricks. 1. Record the same track three times over. Pan one track all the way left and pan another all the way right. Keep one track straight down the middle. This really helps reinforce your voice. 2. One word- Reverb! Add just a touch. If you don't have a reverb function, copy a track you've already made and put it .05 seconds behind the original. Add a third track and move it .1 seconds behind for added effect. These are just a few tips to help in the recording studio. Otherwise, just practice practice practice..... Good luck

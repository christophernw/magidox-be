It comes like second-nature to me. I love going to the gym, and hate the days when I have to force myself not to. I don't think about dieting because I personally prefer healthy foods. . . I think its hard if you keep the mindset that excercise is work and dieting is depriving yourself of something. After working out for while many people feel a certain "rush" from working out and thats what they go back for. . . There are plenty of excercises that aren't fun but the great thing about working out is that there is a variety of excercises for each muscle group to choose from.. . Here is how I stay motivated.. . - Weigh/Look at myself everday. - Check out nutritional information, numbers are deterrents. - Do excercises you like. - Listen to good upbeat music. - Its time for yourself, so you can think about anything you want and get that therapeutic feeling

A theist is someone who believes that a god or gods exist.  Anyone else is an atheist, i.e. not a theist.  That doesn't mean you have to be sure that no gods exist - It can just mean that you don't have a definite belief that they do.. . Personally I am sure that gods are just products of the human imagination, and don't exist in reality, and I have reasoned argument to back it up.  See some of my other replies for details.

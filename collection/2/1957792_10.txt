Thats a good Question, thanks for Asking.. . We reguard all the prophets with utmost respect. However, The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is the leader of all the Prophets. . . And We can find evidence from the Hadith, in which the Prophet Salallahu alayhi wa sallam(pbuh), told us the story of his night journey to the Heavens acsending from Jerusalem. It was there that the 5 Daily Prayers were established, among other things. and In the Narration, He (peace and Blessings be upon him) narrated that He lead all the other Prophets in Prayer.. . It is also proven by the fact that when Jesus (peace be upon him)  will return, He will return as a Follower of Muhammad. meaning, that He will rule by law of the Quran and Way of Muhammad Peace and blessings be upon him. and not by his own laws, when he was a prophet. (as some things that may have been Permissible in His prophethood such as alcohol are not permissible in The Prophethood of Muhammad, salallahu alayhi wa sallam). . wallahu alem(and Allah knows best). good question!  thanks for the opportunity to answer!

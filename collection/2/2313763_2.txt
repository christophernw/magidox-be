The human face is remarkably adept at various contortions, some humorous, some threatening, some pathetic, and so on.. In the usual idiomatic expression, "making faces" is used when someone is being made fun of behind their back, is showing disapproval of something or someone, or when one is merely acting like a buffoon.  So, you would have to know the context.

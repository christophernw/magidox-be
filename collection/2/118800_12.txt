Because its a terrier, THEY HAVE TONS OF ENERGY! You should take them for a walk more often, and maybe they won't chase the cats, and then again, they might anyway, but the terrier family has the most energy in dogs I believe I have a Rat Terrier and A Jack Russel Terrier. They will chase anything that runs because it excites them. . GooD LucK

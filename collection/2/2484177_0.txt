Each cell contains our DNA makeup, it is protected inside the cell from bacteria, viruses and other harmful agents.  Without DNA our body would not be able to replicate and replace the cells which make up for example our organs or skin.  We are constantly producing new skin cells to replace the ones that we shed off every second.

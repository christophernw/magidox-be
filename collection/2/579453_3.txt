i dont think anyone will understand what your going through or undertand  how you feel; this is something you yourself are going through. sometimes its the little things that count, like treating yourself to a little mani-pedi or channeling your energy into favourite past times of yours. Depression can be frustrating to deal with, but keeping yourself busy and mind balanced should keep your mind off the negative aspects in life.

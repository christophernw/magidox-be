The Geneva Convention states that anyone whose status is undetermined by an independent hearing shall be treated as a prisoner of war and have all the protections of a PoW until such a hearing takes place.  NONE of the kidnapped people at Guantanamo have had such a hearing.. . All of the kidnapped people at Guantanamo should be deemed PoWs.  If the US thinks it can do this to these people, imagine what this allows Osama sympathizers to think: "This means I can kidnap, torture, ransom and kill US citizens in my country!". . The US government is guilty of war crimes and they know it.  That's why, in 2003, Rumsfelcher threatened countries with sanctions and violence if they ever attempted to prosecute US citizens or soldiers for war crimes.

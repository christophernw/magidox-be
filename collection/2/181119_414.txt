When I was 15 I worked at a summer day camp, and I had one of the greatest summers ever. You get to be out in the fresh air every day. You will meet lots of new people, and make a lot of great new friends. As for a summer job, I don't think there can be a better one. You won't get rich, but you will have more fun, than you can believe.

I worked as a camp counselor. Loved it. it was a day camp tho.. Then I worked in the childrens room at the library. Loved that too.. But then again, I wanted to be a teacher so I based most of my jobs around kids. Babysitting, camp, library, community house where I helped teach a cooking class for kids. it was fun. it depends on what you like to do. some kids work in a pizza place.

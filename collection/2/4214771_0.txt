It may be the citric acid she doesn't like, or perhaps the bitter smell of orange oil in the peel.  She may be licking the unpeeled orange because they tend to be coated in wax or chemicals or even residue from the plastic bag from the grocery store, but after peeling the orange the acrid scent of the peel is released, and that may be too strong for her nose.   It's likely she'd try to cover it up with something if a piece of the peel were left out somewhere in her living space.

First of all what was wrong with the ticket, your name, address, etc...?   If you show up with a lawyer, then most judges will drop it.  As long as your driver's license number is correct on the ticket, they got you.  Next time slow down!  You can save gas, which will save you money also.  Relax, slow down (not to slow), life is too short to get stressed over a ticket, and driving fast.  . . Sincerely. JJ White

I was in Vegas for Thanksgiving also.  Left St. Louis in snow/ice storm.  Wore jeans and T-shirts in Vegas...comfortably.   Wore a light-weight jacket/windbreaker/warm-up jacket to cut down the chill in the air at night.  Native Las Vegans had on winter coats/parkas... had to laugh at the that...that is NOT cold.  Temperature fell to 60s and the winter coats came out, my group was pleasantly surprised to wear just T-shirts or rugby shirts!

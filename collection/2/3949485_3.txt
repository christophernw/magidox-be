It is an ear infection to the outer ear canal but since you have a perforated eardrum, stay away from ear drops of any kind.  With no ear drum protecting your inner ear, any medicated drops will drain to your inner ear, which may cause some nasty symptoms and possible damage.  Opt for oral antibiotics instead.

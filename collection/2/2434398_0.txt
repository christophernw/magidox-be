If you truly stick to the diet, then eggs don't seem to be a factor.  Fried in exra-virgin olive oil, they make cholesterol problems go down.  It happened to my boyfriend.  His cholesterol and sugar level went down when he went on the South Beach Diet.  We both lost about 30 lbs.  It was totally worth it.

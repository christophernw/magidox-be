They need to be maintained at a temperature of 101 degrees F. and will hatch in about 21 days.  They should be lightly sprayed with clean warm water and the eggs turned 2 or 3 time in a 24 hour period. Do the spraying and egg turning as quickly as you can to prevent the eggs from cooling down from the hatching temperature.  Good luck and hope they all hatch for you.

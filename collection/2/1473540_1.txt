.............Jubilee clinic ,,i don't have my personal experience ,but only heard that it is a place for people who are ready to spend huge bills with number of visits .I know one orthopedics surgeon who is well experienced ,i don't exactly remember his name but know can tell you his address he stays in satya apartments masabtank .i guess he has his clinic in the same apartment .???????( am sorry i cannot exactly remember his name .BESIDE THIS I SUGGEST ONCE TAKE A SECOND OPINION OF ANY GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL DOCTORS THAT WAY IT BECOMES EASY TO DECIDE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES :CAN CHECK OUT AT NIZAMS ORTHOPEDICS .MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT WHEN WE SEE ANY GOVERNMENT DOCTORS  THEY ONLY BOTHER ABOUT THE CURE IN SHORT PERIOD  RATHER THAN REFERENCES OR ANY OTHER THING ; MOREOVER THEY SEE THESE TYPE OF CASES EVERYDAY ;HOPEFULLY WE MAY GET EXCELLENT CURE WITH OUT ANY WORRIES AND WASTE OF  TIME : BEST OF LUCK

It is believed that the functions of pubic hair include the dissemination of pheromones and protection from the friction of sexual intercourse. Natural selection may also have sustained it because it can show a potential sexual partner that the other person is sexually mature and can reproduce. Pubic hair and the growth between the tops of the legs and the buttocks, like under arm hair, helps to lubricate the areas, making movement smoother and more comfortable.. . Possible reasons. There is no definitive theory on the reason for the existence of pubic hair. The prevailing theory relates to pheromones â€” scents that the body produces that can be sexually stimulating to others. In this theory, the tufts of hair that grow around the genitals, as well as under the arms, capture these erotic scents. Pheromones get trapped in the pubic hair when apocrine glands release an odorless secretion on the surface of the skin that combines with bacteria decomposed by the secretions of the sebaceous glands. Humans have the same number of hair follicles as apes, but body hair is generally very fine or barely visible in comparison. So, while pubic hair and underarm hair might be considered the primary scent traps, they are not the only ones. For some people, scents from these areas are noticeable and consciously increase sexual arousal. Pheromones might not be obvious but may be detected subconsciously.. . Another theory is that the pubic hair keeps the genitals warm. The purpose of women's pubic hair could be similar to that of the cilia in the nose, in that it prevents small foreign particles from entering the vagina. Of course this doesn't explain male pubic hair.

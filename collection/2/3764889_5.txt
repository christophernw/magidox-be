Im not paranoid about nudity, in fact, I love it when its appropriate. I just dont hink that it is anything for my 9 and 6 year old sons to deal with right now. Its not because i am a prude or old fashoined. My son waked in the livingroom one night long after he was in bed and my wife and i were watching a movie. there was frontal nudity in it and my son was really bothered and uncomftorble with this. NOT because i told him it was bad, its how he genuinely felt. I love a womans body, but to tell ya the truth, they look better in ligerie than nude.  Lets just protect the kids is all im trying to say.

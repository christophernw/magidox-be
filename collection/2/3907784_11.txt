It was americas fault, through and through. If they only waited to get revenge in a legal way.... that is what it is about, revenge for 9/11. Obviously if 9/11 never happened neither would this war- THATS NOT A GOOD ARGUMENT FOR THE WAR! all the iraqi's blood that has been spilt has gone to repairing americas ego!. . An election doesnt work in a way that "more than half have to vote for precedent"- go read up about seats of power...... . A good country takes responsibilty for what thier people have done!

Please don't intentionally give yourself diarrhea.  If you are trying to lose weight, it's a horrible thing to do.  You can cause all sorts of problems such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, protein malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, etc.  This can lead to heart, liver and kidney problems which result in permanent damage and death.

There are, of course, etymological (having to do with origins of words) reasons, yet the reasons for these origins are often quite arbitrary. With every word comes an expressed idea. . But, if we are beyond discussing why specific words are "bad," I must say that if words did not convey a meaning, language would be without a purpose. To have a language with a degree of efficacy, there must be words that can convey a thought in themselves or can be strung together to convey thoughts. These "bad" words convey anger, frustration, misunderstanding, pain, et cetera.. To sum up, bad words exist to convey the above ideas, and beyond the etymological reasons that certain "bad" words are bad, it really is quite arbitrary.

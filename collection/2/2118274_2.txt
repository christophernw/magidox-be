I'm a doctor and have never heard of a "Radical" aneurysm.  People get aneurysms of the arteries of the brain, the aorta, the heart, the legs.... . The only other thing I can come up with is the "radial" artery, which is in the wrist.  I suppose it could develop an aneurysm.  Are you sure it's not supposed to be "radial" and someone just misspelled it?. . Good luck.

Street drugs are considered Schedule 1 medications. They are not prescribed and are considered to have no medicinal value by the DEA. . . Classes 2 - 5 are controlled medications, with 2 being most abused, ranging to 5 with "least abused". . Not all meds have a DEA Schedule class. they are only for certain classes of medications.. . These C2-C5 medications are also available illegally on the street, which is why these classes are called "controlled". . they are often locked in a "cage" or safe in pharmacies, or locked in a seperate warehouse in the distribution centers. . . they can only be written for a six-month supply, and then the prescription expires. c3-c5 can be written for 90 days a at a time without a "diagnosis code". . some states, like the state of new york, have added security, such as triplicate rx pads, no faxing or calling, and no refills allowed without a diagnosis code.

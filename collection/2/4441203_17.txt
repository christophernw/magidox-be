There's no such thing as a get rich quick scheme.. . You face the same problem now as virtually every adult does every day. You have to find a compromise and work out what is most important to you. Make the most of Summer and Autumn because you can always just go out for a walk - depending what your area is like. If your girl thinks you should always be spending money on her, maybe you should dump her. . . Have a long think and talk to your girl about it. If you don't talk to her about it, the pressure will mount and you'll end up resenting her for everything. You'll have to start a budget and prioritise things according to how important things are.. . Have a look for a real hard job..... it'll remind you why it's worth studying - so you don't have to do that job for the rest of your life.. . Put the computer higher on the list of priority than the drum kit.. The PC does a whole lot more. If you've never played before, get a practice kit which is a lot cheaper and quieter and won't be such an expense if you decide you don't like the drums as an instrument.. . And take a minute to relax and understand that you are 14 and it's not the end of the world to wait a bit longer, or have to save a bit harder or see the girlfriend a bit less. Don't put tonnes of pressure on yourself, the rest of the world will do that for you. Be patient.

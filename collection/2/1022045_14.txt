Well, I wasn't in the Marines, but i grew up w/ a father that was a Marine Corp. Drill Sgt. (I did my time in the AF...  It was like day camp compared to my house). . They are gonna break you down to nothing and then put you back together as a bigger/better person.. . Good luck and thank you for being a good American.

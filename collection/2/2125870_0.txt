No problem, we'll get rid of big business, and go back to living in the stone age. If you're so concerned about the price of fuel, why aren't you driving a hybrid, or a Toyota Echo, or the like. I'll bet that Ranger doesn't get very good mileage. As for flex fuel, where do you think it comes from, the corn fairy. The corn has to be grown and processed to make ethanol. Our farmers have to make a living. On top of which, there is less energy in ethanol than there is in gasoline.(some people have said that by the time you take into account the fuel needed to grow the corn, and later process the ethanol, you actually put more energy into making a gallon, than you get out of it.) If you're concerned about the cost of fuel, sell the Ranger, get a used Geo Metro,(or a moped) and stop complaining. The last time I was in Europe,(2004) it cost $50 to fill up the rental Opel Astra.(about 10 gal.) Besides depending on the state, there is at least 50 cents tax on every gallon of gas.

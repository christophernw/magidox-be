in the UK they are called ice lollies.  one theory could be they were made out of pop at one time, that soda or soft drinks to the rest of you, or it goes pop in your mouth when u pull it out?  if you are really interested check out this site: http://www.madehow.com/Volume-6/Popsicle.html none of my info comes from there but its a good read.

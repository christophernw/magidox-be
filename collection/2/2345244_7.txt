I don't know but I would love to know the same thing. I too had a heart attack a small one but I just don't have energy.. . I was told it was Iron, depression, lack of vitamines and so on but nothing changes..I am not comfortable when I sleep at night. So when I have down time.. . Its like I have no motivation left. Everythin is just Blah outside of work.. . Good Luck on your search because I haven't figure it out myself yet.

Florida State and University of West Florida both offer programs in Marine Archeology, however you will be hard pressed to join up if you're not a student as many of these programs have limited space available and many matriculated students who want to apply.  That being said, it still wouldn't hurt to contact the respective departments -- if they can't accomodate you, they may be able to recommend another way for you to experience it.

I think that an easy way to resolve the problem is to work with the Mexican government for Mexico to become part of the United States, or to expand NAFTA to essentially make the US/Mexico region a free trade zone.  It would help the US create manufacturing jobs that it badly needs and it will provide Mexicans with an economic boost that they badly need.

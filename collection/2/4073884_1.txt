You can pull it off (maybe), but an enourmous amount of legwork will be required.  You should identify a successful, but currently retired, restaurant owner (better yet, an owner of several successful restaurants), and pitch your business plan to him/her.  If your pitch is declined, find another one.  Repeat until you get funded (or until you are ready to give up).

The Da Vinci Code though a work of fiction speaks through the power of suggestion of the Holy Grail as the blood line of Christ. This implies that offspring of a mated Jesus and Mary Magdelene live in France/England.  The image of manly Jesus who co-habitated with Mary goes against church dogma.. . More importantly, the Da Vinci Code hints of Gnosticism in part of Goddess recognition by way of Sophia. We all know that the church is patriarchal and so the belief of a woman in command would appear as blasphemous thus shaking the foundations of the Vatican and the church's powers that may be.

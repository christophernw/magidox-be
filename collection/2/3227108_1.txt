Just press the send button and it will connect you to the other line, you can go back and forth by pressing the send button again and again, just tell the other party on either line to hold on, for if they hang up . . . well you know.  And don't worry, you can't hang up on the party that's still on the line, because to hang up you would have to press the Power (end) button. I have a verizon phone as well. Take care now.

Unit 20 - The Respiratory System. .  . . The respiratory system consists of the lungs and the tubes which connect the lungs to the atmosphere.  The respiratory system is another one of the homeostatic systems.  It works in conjunction with the circulatory system to supply the cells with oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from them.. .  . . A.  Stages of respiration - There are five distinct stages of respiration that can be recognized.. .  . .     1.  Pulmonary ventilation or the movement of air into and out of the lungs.. .  . .     2.  External respiration - Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the lungs.. .  . .     3.  Transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood.. .  . .     4.  Internal respiration - Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and tissues.. .  . .     5.  Cellular respiration - Utilization of oxygen by the cells and the production of carbon dioxide by the cells.. .  . . B.  Anatomy of the respiratory system â€“ The respiratory system consists of the nose and nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs.  It is divided into two functional areas.  The  respiratory zone is the site of gas exchange and consists of the respiratory bronchiole, alveolar ducts, and alveoli.  The conducting zone includes all other respiratory passageways.. .  . .     1.  Nasal cavity - The cavity begins with the external nares through which air enters into the cavity proper (vestibule).  The vestibule is divided into right and left halves by the nasal septum.  . .  . .         a.  The floor of the cavity is composed of the anterior hard palate, and the more posterior soft palate.  The palate separates the nasal cavity from the mouth.  . .  . .         b.  The lateral walls are formed by the irregular nasal conchae bones.  The superior and middle conchae are part of the ethmoid bone while the inferior conchae are separate bones. The entire nasal cavity is lined by moist mucous membrane which warms, moistens, and cleans the air.  The nasal conchae increase the surface area to which the air is exposed.. .  . .         c.  Paranasal sinuses - These are membrane lined cavities found in the frontal, sphenoid, and maxillae bones.  They open and drain into the nasal cavity.. .  . .         d.  Nasolacrimal ducts drain tears from the surface of the eyes into the nasal cavity.. .  . .         e.  Air exits the nasal cavity into the pharynx via the internal nares.. .  . .     2.  Pharynx - This is a muscular tube (throat region) which is used by both the respiratory and digestive tracts.  It is divided into three regions.. .  . .         a.  Nasopharynx - This portion lies immediately behind the nasal cavity.. .  . .             (1) The auditory (eustachian) tubes from the middle ear open into it.. .  . .             (2) The pharyngeal tonsils (lymphoid tissue) are located in its posterior wall.. .  . .             (3) The soft palate and its extension, the uvula, form its floor.. .  . .         b.  Oropharynx - This part of the pharynx extends from the soft palate to the laryngopharynx.. .  . .             (1) The mouth opens into the oropharynx.. .  . .             (2) The lingual tonsils are found in this region at the base of the tongue.. .  . .             (3) The palatine tonsils are found on the sidewalls of the oropharynx.. .  . .         c.  Laryngopharynx - This extends from the oropharynx to the larynx and esophagus.  Like the oropharynx it is a common passageway for both air and food.. .  . .     3.  Larynx - This structure connects the laryngopharynx to the trachea below.  It is composed of nine cartilages.  One of these is the epiglottis, a leaf shaped cartilage that guards the opening into the larynx.  During swallowing the larynx moves upward toward the epiglottis, causing it to tilt and thereby deflect food into the esophagus behind and below the larynx.  Other points of interest on the larynx include the following.. .  . .         a.  Glottis - This is the opening into

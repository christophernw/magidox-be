you cant hold tony blair responsible for the youths of today and prisoners, he doesnt force them to stand on the streets getting rat arsed or be out their face on drugs, which always makes me wonder where they get the money from, seeing as they are so hard done to! and if they dont get enough kicks from that they start attacking people or their property to satisfy their tiny minds. the reason why we have so many criminals and prisoners is because they choose to live that life, its not blairs fault. quite frankly i coudnt give a toss about the prisoners they cost me enough as it is, bleeding well hang the lot! why dont the british public start helping themselves instead of wanting to be spoon fed, we're fighting a war, that doesnt come cheap, to protect our freedom, has the london bombing slipped your mind!

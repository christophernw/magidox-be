Can't agree on that. Looks like you've been badly brainwashed by the Hollywood movies. Why not check out the Bollywood stars? I think they really got the looks and good skin complexion...Also, I used to live in Canada and am now living in Australia, I must say there are as many good-looking ppl among other races as the white ppl.(Sigh...the dominance of American culture on this planet!)

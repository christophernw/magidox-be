i hasn't opened in a while because it closed about 7 years ago.  i helped clean it out.  i don't know if they were intending to reopen it, but i think they ran out of money.  i imagine the building is still there, because it's historic and whatnot, but i don't know that there has been any theatre there for a while.. sorry i can't be of more help.

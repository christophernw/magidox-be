Well, I can relate to how you are feeling.  I use feel that men didn't like me.   I had the same problem that men didn't find me attractive enough.  There will be someone out there for you.  I am currently in a relationship even though ti is long distance.  You need to find someone who shares your common interests.  Just don't settle.  Be good to yourself first, then things will take care of itself.

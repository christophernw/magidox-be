Belonging to any religion in which you were raised is easy because you don't have to give it much thought, therefore you don't have to do a lot of research on the subject.. . Becoming an atheist or making a radical change in religious belief (say from catholic to Shinto for example) requires a lot of thought, research, soul searching (no pun intended) and consideration. In addition, explaining this conversion of thinking to ones family and circle of close relationships requires that one be able to defend their decision.. . this is why Atheists tend to know more about holy texts than many of the followers of those religions.. . People who say Atheists lack a moral center simply don't know much about them and their comments are honestly as bigoted as say "all black people are lazy" (NO I DON"T AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT JUST USING IT AS AN EXAMPLE). . In fact Atheists tend to have very strong moral centers because they have considered their humanity and have made conscious decisions about what they believe to be right and wrong, a situation that most people who follow highly rule based belief systems don't generally do.. . Trust your own thoughts and feelings about these people and have the strength to not listen to those who would have you believe the slur and not the reality.. . BTW aren't Christians not supposed to Judge each other? Isn't that God's work?

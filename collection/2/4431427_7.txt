It shouldn't be.... . Mohammed said, "The most excellent Jihad (Holy War), is within". . and, "The ink of the scholar, is worth more than the blood of a martyr".... . His closest disciple, Abu Bkr said, "The spiritual warrior has no outside enemies".... . So you can see that anything less than these high standards, is an abomination...

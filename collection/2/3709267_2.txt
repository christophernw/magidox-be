Some cars have a anti-theft device which will lock up the ignition if the car is turned off with the front wheels turned.  Try turning your steering wheel without the key inserted.  If it stops after moving only a couple of inches, this is probably the problem. . . To fix the problem, simply insert the key (but don't turn it yet). Turn the steering wheel until it stops moving.  Now move the steering wheel until it is is not resting against the anti-theft device(half-way between the two stopping points).  This should free the ignition, and should fix the problem.

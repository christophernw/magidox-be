The question is very broad, but due to the age of the vehicle I can probably guess.  Drivability problems like this are usually caused by a vacuum leak.  Do not be tempted to try and find the specific leak.  Vacuum hose is very cheap, just go buy about 10 feet of it and replace it all. You will be amazed at the improvement in performance.  This is all assuming that a sensor is not bad and that the check engine light is off.

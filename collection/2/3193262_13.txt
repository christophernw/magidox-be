I don't think there's a "certain" way to get popular. But here are some tips: Smile A LOT, smile at people in the hall you don't even know.  People like that. Second of all, talk about other people. We are all selfish people and we love to talk about ourselves. So when someone starts talking to you and you listen, people like that. Then they tell about you to another friend and that friend decides to come to you for someone to talk to or for advice.  Eventually you'll have a lot of people that look up to you because you show that you genuinely care about everyone.  Hope this helps! Best of luck-Steph

I'm a paraplegic and I don't think my sex life is that much different than any other person. No I can't feel below the belt but things can still be made to happen for me. It's a matter of learning how the mind works. Through some physical and visual stimulation I can achieve feelings of passion and pleasure quite well. I've learned that for me to climax my partner has to first. Your mind controls all your bodies senses so if you can figure out how to stimulate your mind then you're in good shape for a good sex life. I'm quite fit and have a strong upper body. I've done it in my chair, on a bed and in a changeroom in a clothing store after hours with the owner. Just because a person is in a wheelchair doesn't mean they can't be sexual. I hope this wasn't too much info for anybody.

A tan is a excess of melanin that the body produces to combat long-term, frequent sun-exposure. A sunburn is from the UV rays that strike your body, that actually cause a burn, and occurs, generally, in one sitting. . So, tan is long-term, and not too bad for you at all, so long as you wear sunscreen, and don't go to salons; A burn is short term, horribly increases the chances of developing skin cancer, and hurts like hell.

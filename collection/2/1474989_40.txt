I lost my 10 year old daughter 6 years ago to the dreaded Leukemia disease....it broke my heart..but also opened it to a new found hope.... . Isaiah 57:1 got me through the terrible grief I had to suffer:  "The righteous pass away;the godly often die before their time.  And no one seems to care or wonder why. No one seems to understand that God is protecting them from the evil to come. For the godly who die will rest in peace.. . I was comforted by this scripture and it helped me to realize that even though we don't know "why" young people die, there is hope that someone much more Powerful and All-knowing has it in His plan.  For me, it changed my whole perspective on what was important in life.  God does not allow death to teach a lesson, I do not believe this is how God is, BUT...I do believe He allows such tragedies to bring us closer to Him if that is what we choose to do.  It truly helped me face the conflict of "why"....whatever you do hon, never lose faith in God....He wants to help you through your confusion.

wipeing out the bad people doen't make the world a better place because according to the bible we are all  sinners.  that means we'd all have to be destroyed.  bad people aren't the problem. the problem is that we live in a fallen world and satan's the price of it.  Now don't get me wrong one day God's children will be seperated from the weeds of the earth and the weeds will burn in hell therefore making the world a better place.  somewhat like eden.  but that's not going to happen un till the rapture.  which could be anytime.  the lord says soon.

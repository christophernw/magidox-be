All paintings of Jesus were from the Renaissance or later. Every know portrait was lost during the dark ages, or exists in the Vatican's private library (which is restricted). We don't know what Jesus looked like, but we do know that he most likely had the same colored skin as everybody else, or there would probably be a description about his unusual appearance in the Bible. The traditional portrait look of Jesus is based upon tradition, and not factually.

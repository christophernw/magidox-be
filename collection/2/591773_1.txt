In itunes view the songs by album, go to the songs in the album you want to change the order of.  Right click the first song.  Click on get info, then go to the info tab.  Then change the track number to the whatever number you want the song to play.  For example if you are looking at the first song on the album, but you want it to be the fourth song you hear, change the track number to 4, then go to the second song and change the track number again.  Do this for all of the songs in the album, then the songs should play in that order.   Keep in mind changing that order in itunes will not change it on your ipod, so change the track numbers on the songs in your ipod.  hope this helps.

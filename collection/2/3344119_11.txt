I thought that this "rule" was eliminated from the Catholic doctrine at Vatican II.  Anyways, it was traditionally an act of penance to remember Christ's suffering on Good Friday.  I don't think there is any significance to the choice of fish over animal meat, but fish is less filling and this light meal was just a way for folks to sustain their strength but make a small sacrifice for their faith.

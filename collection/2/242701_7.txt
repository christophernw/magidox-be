i used to work at a taco bell on a military base, and for the most part, we had a LOT of return customers, mainly because the taco bell was on a military base. a lot of people there were so used to it, maybe its just because its a grade of food that is still safe to eat, its just processed to the point that your body reacts adversely to it and you get the upset stomach and such.

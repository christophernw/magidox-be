I don't think being Gay is as difficult as it was 20 years ago.  People just did not come out and say guess what I'm gay because there are people out there still who will beat the crap out of you for being gay.  Then another problem gay men encounter is that everyone thinks gay men are flaming and dress up like women and act like a woman.  Then you have to deal with your friends, family, co-workers.  People will turn on you very quickly when you say I'm Gay.  I feel bad for many gay people, it's just like when you fess up to being in an interracial relationship, all the poop hits the fan and some people just find it easier to keep it to themselves so they don't have to deal with all the drama.

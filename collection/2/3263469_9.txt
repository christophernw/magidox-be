Lord & Lady are generally terms used to refer to the God & Goddess, though their use in some covens and circles to refer to the High Priest and Priestess is an anachronism that is found meaningful, a reference to the feudal era's terms for those of higher standing.. . Many cultures and peoples use the names of their various deities as names or the basis of names.  For example, hispanic culture includes 'Jesus' (hey-zeus) as a common name for a male, but this is not considered disrespectful.  Mary is a popular latinized name, yet it is not considered an insult of the mother of Jesus.. . Ultimately, it's in the eye of the beholder whether it's disrespectful or not, because no one can know but the user if it's been chosen respectfully or not.

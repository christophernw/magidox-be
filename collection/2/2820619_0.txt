well its kinda the agentic shift, passing the blame onto someone else. for example, the genocide in Rwanda, the people who carried it out said they were only following orders. Its human nature to blame someone or something else for ones own mistakes, after all even subconscioulsy we all think we are perfect in certain ways, and if we make a mistake, we arent perfect, but its good to blame some one else for what has happened that makes un inperfect, as we seek to become the best

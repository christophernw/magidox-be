In the Uk we have the Writers and Artists Yearbook - there'll be an equivalent in the US if that's where you are.. Look through agents first. many publishers only accept submissions from literary agents. after you have exhausted all potential Literary agents then move on to publishers who publish your target genre.. don't pay any reading fees. reputable agents do not charge reading fees.. don't give up.. good luck.

It is recommended that riders on the Honda CRF70F not attemt to pop a wheely as for the bike could become unstable causing the rider to lose control and crash causing serious injury or death. This will also cause damage to the bike's engine and will void the bike's warranty. Although not recommended this should only be attempted by a professional rider wearing an approved helmet and all other saftey gear on a closed off-hwy course and choose to "waive" the bike's warranty.

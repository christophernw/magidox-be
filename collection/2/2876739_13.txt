marriage counseling can work if you work with it. a counselor will help the two of you communicate better. sometimes it is hard to talk to someone when you are fighting all the time, you will be given ways to express yourself without escalating into a fight. A counselor can also help you and your husband to see things from the others perspective. you'd be amazed how much it can help to really understand the other persons perspective. last but not least a counselor will help you decide if their is a marriage worth saving. if you and your husband both commit to really participate and be truthful to one another about your feelings your marriage can be saved. please go and try because even if you still end up separated you can look back upon it and know you did your best to try and work it out. good luck!

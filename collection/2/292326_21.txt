Couple of things for your current general knowledge:. . Germany is one of the most or maybe the most diverse country in europe.  . . Not all germans were nazi back when Hitler was in power, most disagreed with the regime but had no choice because it was either like it or get gassed along with the jews. . . And white supremacists are known to hate many things (watch it, not saying all of them do), and thus some commit hate crimes.  Hate crimes will get them 30 years in prison in Germany, sending them there would do them not good.  . . But personally, i don't think they worship Hitler as it is, i think they worship the ideals that Hitler had.  I don't think the nazis would have accepted white supremacists because they come from the country that aided the allies, which now is a capitalist country doing many things that are very wrong in the Leftist socialists mind, and thus back then and right now would be an enemy.

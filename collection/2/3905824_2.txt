A pneumothorax is an air pocket within the pleural space, disabling the lung from expanding, thus making it harder to breathe.....however a dropped lung is called Atelectasis or collapsed lung. If you have atelectasis because of broken ribs they call that a "flail chest"....usually seen in car accident victims from the steering wheel trauma......

Yes you should go to the gyn to get checked every year. You may not be sexually active but this can not prevent you from getting cervical cancer or ovarian cysts. When you get a pap they check your vaginal area as well as your cervix to check for cancer. If you don't get checked they won't be able to detect it and early detection is the best form of prevention so just think about it!

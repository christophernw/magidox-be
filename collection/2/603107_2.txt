When you pull out the existing kit follow the wires, the ones that go to the doors are speakers, the ones that head towards the engine are the power, easy! Usually you've got red and blue for power, however these can also be brown and yellow depending on the car, month it was made, moon cycle, who won the world cup last etc... Best bet is to follow the cables and see where they go, or lay new cables down, it makes a big difference for the fidelity.

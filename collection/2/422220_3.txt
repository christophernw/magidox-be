Maggots only come from flies laying eggs in the wounds.  The maggots aren't a huge problem (just disgusting), but they do hatch into MORE flies.  You definitely want to have all of them removed by a vet.  He may have missed some of the eggs or flies might have laid more.. . If you have flies in the house, check under the house and inside your chimney for dead animals - that is the #1 source for them.  Put up fly catching strips and/or consult an exterminator.  If you live in a rural area, check around for dead animals near your house - they need to be buried at least four feet deep to prevent the flies from finding them.. . Your vet may be able to suggest a safe fly repellent for dogs that you can apply before taking them outside for short walks.  You can also check with stores that sell camping gear for a product like this.  (Don't put the repellent ON the wound!)  As the others have said, don't leave the dogs outside at all until the wounds have healed.. . You can also buy mosquito netting and make a jacket for the dog to cover the affected area.  Horse people buy fly sheets and hoods for their horses to keep the flies from attacking their ears - might be able to adapt one for a dane?. . I haven't bought from these companies, so I'm not recommending them - they're just examples for you to see what I'm talking about.. . http://www.james-howard.co.uk/james%20howard/(zjr45f45s0vpvjegpogugi55)/web%20store/Browse.aspx?Id=22. . http://www.e-tackroom.com/catalog/product.asp?id=64

While snow is ice it is not as dense as normal ice or an ice cube.  The molecules in an ice cube have formed without much air, which allows them to bond very closely to each other when water turns into a solid.  Snow on the other hand forms in air and the molecules are not as densely packed - which gives it many edges to refract light and thus the "white" appearance.

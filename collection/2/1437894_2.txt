No worries, 30 seconds is a looooong time for anything flying, you know?  The moment you closed the door those bugs couldn't see/smell you anymore, so either they found something else to chase or went home.  Remember they don't understand the concept of doors or houses & wouldn't hang around until you came back like they do in movies.  For them you basically disappeared.

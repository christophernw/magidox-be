Logic and rationality are somewhat part of "religion", however, in Christianity we believers understand (or should understand) that God is the finality of existance. In other words, what He says, goes. God created everything by His word and His ideas, this earth is not ours. The Bible says, "For my thoughts (Gods) are not your thoughts, neither are your (us) ways my ways." So, what we as humans perceive to be logical and rational may not be so with God.

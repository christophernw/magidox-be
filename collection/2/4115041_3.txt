A lot of people have told you it is calcium carbonate which is correct.  It is an ionic compound with each molecule made from a Ca ++ ion (positive charge 2) and a carbonate ion (CO3)-- (negative charge two).  The Carbon and 3 Oxygen atoms in the carbonate ion are held together by covalent forces.  The Ca ion and Carbonate ion are held together ionic (charge) attraction. Hope that helps a bit more.

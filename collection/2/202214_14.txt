Funny enough, drinking a lot of water gets rid of water retention. your body retains water in your cells because you are not getting enough, so when you do get a lot of water it releases what it was retaining. Also, salt makes you dehydrated and thus makes you retain water.. cut down on your salt intake and drink water. As simple as that!

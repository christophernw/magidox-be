For the same reason it wouldn't work anywhere else.  You can't just up and divide a country-- people have lived and settled in a place and all of a sudden, it's only for Sunnis or only for Shias?  What if you had a business there for five years and then you have to leave?  That's a lot of start-up costs and stuff to simply tank because people can't get along.  People will defend their homes to the end, and that's not going to solve any civil war problems that might arise in the near future.

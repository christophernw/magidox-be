It's instinctual for them to avoid deep water. You can break this fear by bathing them when they are a kitten in a sink. Sometimes this makes them realize that a bath is okay. . . Random story; you know how animals are generally afraid of the vacuum? A friend of mine vacuumed her pets (dog and cat) since they were young. When they started to shed bad, she would pull out the vacuum and vac the source so she wouldn't have to vac it off the floor later. Now when the animals hear the vacuum they come running lol. They love it!. . Just an example of how starting young can break natural fears.

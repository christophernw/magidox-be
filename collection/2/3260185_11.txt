If your concept of God is the omnimax version, then it is entirely to blame.  If you have a God with limits, then it isn't to blame (but is it worthy of worship?). Since I don't believe anything supernatural exists, I spend as much time blaming a God for anything as I do blaming a radioactive cloud for the eventual extinction of mankind in "On the Beach".

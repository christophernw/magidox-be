i dont know if they sleep, their time here (which is a few days not 24 hours) is not for leisure, all they need to do is mate and recreate, which brings us to our next point.. the male mounts the female, insetrting sperm to fertilize her eggs, then she lays her eggs in something decompising, like trash or dead bodies.. 12-24 hours later maggots hatch and start eating the decomposing material. another12-24 hours and they turn into flies, which live 2-3 days

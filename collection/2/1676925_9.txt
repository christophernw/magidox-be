BUSH WOULD JUST LIKE TO SWEEP HIS POPULARITY DELINE UNDER THE RUG ALONG WITH THE WAR AND THE MILITARY ISSUES TOO AND OUR POWS, AND THE VETERANS THAT HAVE COME BACK SICK AND KATRINA AND HOW THE GOV. SCREWED UP FEMA. I GUESSS IMIGRANTS ARE ALL TO BLAME THERE TOO HUH? I WILL FUCKING MARRY WHO I WANT TO MARRY. AND I DON'T NEED A MAN OR A GOV. TO TELL ME HOW OR NOT TO DO IT. I GUESS IF I WANTED TO BE ALL UP IN BUSH'S BEDROOM I COULD BE BUT IM NOT AND I WOULD PREFER HE STAY OUT OF MINE AND STOP SCREWING UP THIS COUNTRY.

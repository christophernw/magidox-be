I've never before heard of any pub where you are not allowed to drink, although there are some pubs who will decline to serve very drunk customers.. . I can understand about not being allowed to smoke although the point that smoking is bad for health does not make sense since drinking isn't exactly a healthy choice.. I do not smoke and do not like the smell of cigarettes very much but I do have lots of friends who smoke so I live with it. . Also I think girls who smoke look SEXXXYYYYYY - from a distance.. . So, what to do? Ask the bar man to fill some liquor in a plastic pouch, tie it with a rubberband and add straw to it. . . EnJoy it just outside the PUB so you can come in for the next one!

The best method (if you are a man) is to wail and cry loudly, assert repeatedly that you don't have a cold - you have the flu, tell everybody you know that you're dying, curl up under a duvet, use your best puppy-dog eyes to get friends/girlfriends/relatives to bring you soup and make out a will.. That's what I do.. . If you're a woman - you ignore it and get on with your life.

I can relate...I have anxiety disorder and I panic about everything.  The best thing I've found is to realize that I do not have control over everything, and that's ok.  Do your best, and that's all you can do.  This sounds weird, but if you ever want to talk about it feel free to email me.  I help a lot of people who have this problem.

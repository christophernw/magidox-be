My friend tried this with her food processor since ground cloves are so expensive.  It took 20 minutes and still didn't work well.. . Try a small spice grinder or coffee grinder.  Better yet, look at the spices in the hispanic section of your market.  The spices there are much cheaper than the big name brands like McCormick, so ground cloves should cost a lot less.

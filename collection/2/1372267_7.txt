The way I see it, you have a couple of choices. You could do what all these pansies are telling you to do. OOOHHH no stop go to a dentist. you could hurt yourself. OH you'll crack your enamel. you'll hurt your teeth more.blah, blah, blah. You could also just smack yourself in the mouth with a 7 pound sledge hammer until the darn things just fall out of your mouth. . . What do you mean NEED TO???? What's up with that?

Shelby got it right.  Just make sure that whether you have a manual car or an automatic you step on the brakes while doing it! Sometimes, people do it when the engine gets below the 1 mark... sorry I don't know the proper terms for these but I'm female and all I know is how to drive the car. Someone just told me to do that so that the engine wouldn't die down.

I would take magnesium glycinate to dissolve the calcium deposits, and make sure you are not taking inorganic limestone derived calcium. The stuff causes many problems, and is actually not very good for bone health. Apple cider vinegar can dissolve the calcium carbonate shell off of an egg in several days. Its also a great tonic. Give it a try.

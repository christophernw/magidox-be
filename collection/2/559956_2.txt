I do know the answer to this from my own experience. I had many hair problems when I was younger, primarily because I was extremely sensitive to all the chemicals and additives in commercial shampoos. My scalp would flake tremendously and my hair looked thin, bad and lifeless. So I stopped using harsh shampoos - a shampoo which is kind and beneficial is tree tea oil (Tesco sells it under its  brand) .The results were immediate. .I stopped the daily shampooing - over washing is really bad for the hair and it is acknowledged as one of the reasons for premature graying and hair loss. My hair had started to recede at the temples and a bald patch was developing on the crown so I started a routine of quite vigorous nightly brushing in of a natural pure oil (organic is good) using a small stiff bristled brush (held in the palm). Left it on overnight ( protected pillow with an old sheet) and washed off in the morning. Very quickly the hair started growing thicker and developed a healthy sheen.. I had read that one way to restore growth was to use a scalp irritant.like pepper. Did not try that but found that by very vigorously brushing the receding areas it stopped receding and the growth was restored over a period of time.. So now my hair grows normally and I have a full head of healthy hair..

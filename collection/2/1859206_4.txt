Not very easily unless you own a lab, it can be made at home though by mixing potassium nitrate (available pretty easily) and sulfuric acid (available in car batterys) and then distilling the mixture and collecting the nitric acid that forms.. You need to know what your doing though as this stuff can disolve your skin, also the KNO3 (potassium nitrate) is very explosive.

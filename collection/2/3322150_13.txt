I chose mine because it was the first place that felt right.  I had been to almost every type of service and never really fit in I guess.  Then I attended an LDS church and it felt good.  i went home and prayed that night for an answer to if this is where i should be, I recieved a calming and warm feeling telling me that I was supposed to be there.

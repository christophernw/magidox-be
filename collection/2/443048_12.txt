Wow, it must suck to be you, lol. Would you rather be complaining that no one ever hits on you? Smile, grin and bear it. If it happens as often as you say you must be fairly hot so I don't think the attention will stop any time soon. Or stop going out for beer, drink at home but that might not be as much fun.

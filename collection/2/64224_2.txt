People seek attention from others and the world's morals have went to the devil.Clubbing is a waste of mind and spirit. Sadly it is a common thing to do on friday and saturday nights for young people that are caught up in the spin of media's social ideas.You can thank you ungodly government and entertainment industry for that one.God Bless

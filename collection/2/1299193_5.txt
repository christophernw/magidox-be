This is interesting.. Are the snakes you sense real snakes, or just long tubes ?. Is everything made of snakes, or is it just the odd snake hanging around ?. It doesn't seem that the snakes are a danger to you, except for your worries.. As other answerers have suggested, there is probably a big change happening somewhere in your life, your mind is trying to understand the change and you are sensing the change as snakes.. Look at your everyday life and notice any big changes that have happened recently - try to understand and accept them.

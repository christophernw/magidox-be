Since I live in KC I'll tell you how our teams got their names. The Kansas City Royals got their name by holding a essay contest back in 1969. The winning entry thought the team should be named after "The American Royal" an equestrian event that's held yearly in KC. The KC Chiefs football team are named after former mayor Roe Bartle who was known as "the chief".

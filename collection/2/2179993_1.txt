If you asked 10 experts, you'd probably get 10 different answers.  In my opinion (and opinion is all it is) it's due to:. . 1.  A lot of money in the system which is looking for higher returns than available in fixed income investments (bonds). . 2.  Continued strenghth in the economy, despite the shock of higher energy costs. . 3.  Increased confidence that the Fed will continue to strive to contain inflation, despite the change in Fed leadership.

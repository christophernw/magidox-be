He did not save the dinosaurs because they had died out 65 million years before.  The bible says the dinosaurs were created on the third day look at the verse that contains great sea creatures the Hebrew word for that is only used in one more case when Moses throws his staff down and it turns in to a serpent. So since we have two cases of the word we can imply that it covers both in a general way aka lizards. The word great in Hebrew can also mean big or huge so there you have it big lizards. As for the time gap look it also says the sun and the moon were created after the first day but is says that light and the world were created on the first day. This is obviously a mistake. The word for earth is the same world in Hebrew for land (aretz) this can be loosely translated to also mean matter so you can read from this light and then matter were created on the first day. Sounds like the big bang to me. For more info on this topic read Since of God by Dr. Gerald Schroeder. . He will give you answers to this and many other questions you might have

when you start thinking that, remember that how your life turns out starts with your thoughts. That's the first step. Now, while you're thinking what you've been thinking, STOP- and think if you really want to be what you're contemplating. I don't think you do- so stop convincing your-self that you are as bad as you think you are. Besides, on whose standards are you basing these ratings? Don't let others make your decisions for you.

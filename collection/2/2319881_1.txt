Water, water, water...it flushes your system of toxins & other little nasties that cause fat cells to adhere to your hips or whatever. Just be careful because, believe it or not, it is possible to drink too much water.. . Also cut down on any sodas, choose green leafy veggies for meals & cut your meat portions in half. Between these things & some moderate exercise, you should drop the weight rather fast...

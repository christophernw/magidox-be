Maybe something is wrong with the dog. You should take it to a vet to be sure.. If you mean puppies, put the puppy's bed by your bed. Put toys (preferably stuffed ones) in the bed for the dog. . This gives them a sense of security. they are used to sleeping with thier littermates. something to cuddle up with should help. And puppies teethe. The dog's teeth may be hurting.

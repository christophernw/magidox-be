Buy a facial steaming kit. You can get these at some chemists. and use this to steam your face every day. . . And start a cleanse, tone, moisturizing routine...every single day.... . Drink plenty of water, more fruit and vegetables, regular excercise...and you should be on your way ;-). . But don't forget to steam!!! This will really help to open up the pores so that your skin can breathe and therefore less bacteria means fewer spots...

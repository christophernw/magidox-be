DC is Direct Current in which the electrons move in one direction through the wire all the time.. AC is Alternating Current in which the electrons flow one way for a short time and then switch directions and flow the other way for a while.. The constant direction switching does not interfere with the work the electricity does if the devices using it are properly designed. Some devices, like incandescent light bulbs, work equally well with either type of current. Other types of devices, like transformers, depend on the constant switching to operate.

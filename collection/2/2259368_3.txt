The proper way to fold a letter is in to thirds with the top of the page as the one that will be on the top or showing when placed in an envelope (so when the receiver opens it the first thing they will see is the logo). You can fold the other two "thirds" like a fan. This is hard to explain without being able to show you - hope it helps!

I think the laws are state wide- I have a 21 year old friend, who was looking into becoming emancipated for financial reasons. He's been out on his own since age 17, with no support from anyone in his family (admirable, huh?). Yet he's having probelms with financial aid for school because they will not, in our great state of Pennsylvania, condiser you financially responsible for yourself until you are 23. Anyway, he looked into the process and from what I understand, there really ISN'T a way-- at least he had no luck and that was the end result of his research.. Good luck though- I hope for your sake that I'm wrong.

Actually, the moon does have an atmosphere, and EXTEAMLY thin, tiny, very small, negligible atmosphere.. . The chances of getting hit are miniscule, there is virtually no risk.  You can see the moon of covered with impact craters, but remember, these happened over the course of billions of years.  The chances are very slim, you would have to VERY unlucky to be hit.

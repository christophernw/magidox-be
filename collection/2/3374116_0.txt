With traditional mechanical watches, the mechansm that provided "power" was a spring as opposed to a battery with modern watches. So, a watch had to be "wound" in order to compress the coil spring inside. As the spring slowly uncoiled, it provided the steady force that moved the gears inside that in-turn moved the hands that told the time.

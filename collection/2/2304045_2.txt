To quote the insightful entertaining Anime “Full Metal Alchemist”:. They are the Dogs of the Military.. . They do what they have been ordered to do.. The higher ups such as the president have they’re own reasons, but the rest kill out of orders to do so… they either like it or hate it, but they are Dogs none the less, and loyal to their commander and chief and country through oath.. . If they were told a special version of what defines a terrorist, they will accept that definition or at least act like they accept it. If they were then told so and so was a terrorist, and then told that they are to fight the terrorist they either do it or disobey orders.

Where are these studies?  Got any links?  . . First of all, you can't generalize.  There are some extremely intelligent Christians in every vocation.. . Secondly, perhaps there could be some rationale behind such a figure (if it were proved true).  Humans tend to get "puffed up" thinking they possess "knowledge".  People with an inflated sense of self-importance often don't see a "need" for God...their god fits between their ears.. . . You wrote: "heaven with serial killers like Ted Bundy Jeff dahmer and Pol Pot and Hitler". . Huh?  What is that all about?  Those statements sound like they are motivated by bias...not by "intellect".

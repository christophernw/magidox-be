You know it is out of pure ignorance and lack of respect for others.  I am sorry to see this happen but I have a sister that I saw this happen to so many times.  She had the bi pass surg. done and still was not able to lose all the weight. I am sure many times she silently cried because of people's rudeness.  Everyone has feelings, even the mean people who do this.  They will understand when they decide to grow up.  If this is happening to you look inside your heart and make your mind over to be a good person no matter what.  And if you so choose do something for yourself to make you feel good about you!

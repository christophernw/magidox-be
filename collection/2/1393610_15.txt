Hoover had an idea of the economy falling and put too much of the solution on industrialism. This could only carry so far when the market began to crash.  He stubbornly held onto one idea, and put all of his energy in making it work.  I believe he tried, but in his position he did not have the luxury of time to review his options.  . FDR was enthusiastic and pragmatic.  He was willing to try anything to find a solution.  "Try something.If it works, keep doing it.  If it doesn't, try something else."  FDR was not hindered by the ideas of social classes.  His New Deal focused on relief, recovery, and reform.

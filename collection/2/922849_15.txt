I agree.  The secret to a long marriage, I've found out, is to have a sense of humor about life.  When kids spill things on the carpet that leaves a permanent stain you can get mad or realize that now you have a family story to tell for years.  When things don't go right laugh it off, take a deep breath, and keep plugging along.  If more people had a sense of humor about life and marriage, the divorce rate would not be around 60% as it currently is.  A little laughter goes a long ways.

You can actually download a template for note cards or if you purchase a pre-perforated note card paper the steps are outlined there as well. Avery papers makes a myriad of card stock most of which can be easily obtained at any office supply.  I have seen some beautifully pre-printed blanks as well where you just type in the sentiment, invitation, announcement or whatever you need. Good Luck!

Well here is my guess. This is how it happened to me.. . The local recruiter was right next to a record shop. I am driving home after work and wanted to pick up a new CD. There was this guy standing out side with a cooler. Leaning on the wall in class b's smoking a cig. I go to walk past him and he flips open the cooler. I look inside and it is full of Klondike bars. And he says "Hey buddy, what would you do for a Klondike bar?" 12 hours later i was at Fort Jackson for BCT.. . That's not how it really happened but i was always asked that question when i was in the Army.

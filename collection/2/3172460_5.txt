Just tell him. If he is your friend he will accept you for who you are. He might just being saying that gays are 100% wrong just to be cool and follow the crowd, but once he knows you are, he might be more open to it. Make sure he knows that you are telling him because he is your friend not because you want to hook up with him. If he thinks that, you will definitely lose a friend.

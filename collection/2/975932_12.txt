I used to do that.  Then I got a CBC (complete blood count) to check for other stuff, and I found out I was anemic.  If you're sleeping a whole lot, cold easily, and getting bad headaches, please get it checked out.  Anemia can lead to needing blood transfusions, and I don't know about you, but that doesn't sound fun to me!

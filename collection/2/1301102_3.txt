Antimatter is just like ordinary matter except that the electric charges are reversed. Anti-protons have a negative charge and anti-electrons (aka positrons) have a positive charge. . . Every type of particle in nature has its own corresponding anti-particle type. Physicists have found that in high energy collisions, larger particles always breakdown into pairs of smaller ones having equal numbers of normal particles and anti-particles. Yet for reasons unkown, the universe we know and love today wound up mostly normal particles. Outside of physics labs, antimatter is incredibly rare.. . But that's just as well becuase when matter and antimatter meet, they have this nasty habit called 'mutual annihilation.' That means they attract one other (due to the opposite electric charge) and upon contact both particles are destroyed and an equivilant amount of gamma rays are released. In other words, they blow up.

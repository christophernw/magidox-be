Alcohol will freeze, just not at a temperature you can create in your home.  Everything has a point at which it changes from a liquid to a solid.  To find the freezing point of vodka, you need to determine its chemical composition and subtract each of the componants freezing point from that of water...Sounds like a lot of work.  Why not estimate something like 277 degrees below zero.

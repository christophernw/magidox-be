ive ponderd that aswell but i came to the conclusion that we were created in his image and not identical to him. so we might be similar in terms of being humanoid . but not exaclty alike as he? tends to be omnipotent, and perfect and a lot of things we arent. . i also wonder if there are things we are that god isnt.. infact am asking that right now

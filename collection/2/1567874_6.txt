Ha ha ha.. . I always love to see separtist minded Quebecois shoot their mouth off like this. Go ahead and separate. See how long you last. See if your economy stays afloat and the Cree up north continue to put up with your narrow minded French is best crap. I bet they'll turn all the lights in Quebec City off three days after you separate. Let's see how cultured you are then.. . Why don't you show a little faith, try to get along with your neighbours and work to improve this country. Canada was built by the Quebecois just as much as it was by Anglos. Quebec has it's stamp on this state. Take some pride in the efforts your forefathers put into this country and stop being such a whiny b#tch.

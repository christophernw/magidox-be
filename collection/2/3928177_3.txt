It's already that bad, people are already leaving...it has been this way for some time.  It started with former Sec. of State Colin Powell.  Bush's boat is sinking and many people are jumping ship before it's too late!  Unfortunately, the American people are in the boat and we can't jump.  We are in for this sad ride because he won the election of '04.  I'm sorry to depress everyone.  And it was such a nice day.....

Because we don't think it's up to you to decide where we belong. We are free individuals with various talents and WE are the ones who choose which ones we want to put into good use and how. Men who think they can tell us what to do and who haven't yet discovered that they have hands too and can cook and clean themselves tend to get us mad. Personally I just pity those who are helpless and starving when they don't have a woman around to prepare them a meal. May they grow up one day and become independent individuals like us.

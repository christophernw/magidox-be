She's your friend, you know her well...treat her the way you'd want to be treated if it was you instead of her. Get in touch with your local hospice. They will send you literature or send someone out to counsel you on how to best help her if you plan to spend any significant amount of time with her. I have been in your place...there is plenty of time for tears after your loved one has passed. Enjoy her and let her enjoy you as much as possible. She is about to transition, it is not to be sad about,  just the life energy turning another page. Love her. Be honest with her. Respect and try to understand her moods during these coming days. Facing death involves going through several stages or levels of acceptance. There is a great book out there, very short and to the point, called "Good Grief" by Granger Westberg, which is very helpful in showing folks how to deal intimately with  impending death, their own or that of a loved one. I think you might find it helpful to both of you. Good luck to you.

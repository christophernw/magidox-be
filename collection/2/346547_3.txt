take it off the charger first. get some keyboard/computer spray (preferably nitrogen-based), take the cover off, then CAREFULLY take the battery out and set it aside. . spray all of the contacts. next, do the same thing to the battery. take the keypad out (if you can) and spray it and the buttons underneath. Let it dry for an hour or two and then wipe it all off with a towel. put everything back together and then see if it works. If you need more help, email me (ht9150@yahoo.com)

That's a great question, and it's increasingly obvious that our school system is based on an old and antiquated model that won't help us become competitive as a nation.  Investing, saving and financial management are the fundamental keys to being a successful adult... but I think the old model of the school system views that as being too "greedy" and "non-intellectual".  Things like English and Social Studies are necessary, but Finance is frankly just as fundamental to success.

I am so very sorry for your loss.  You are young and I know this is a difficult thing for you to understand.  Your friend was not an example - she was a child of God, and believe me, he loves her.  You are left here on this earth, but she is in a better place now.  Try to take it a day at a time.  As you grow older and experience life's joys and trials, the hole in your heart will heal.  Live a good life, remember your friend, and cherish her memory.  You will see her again, I promise.

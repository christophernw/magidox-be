Really Christianity teaches that?  I am very surprised.  . Yes you will burn in hell if you don't love him back.  Is that so hard to believe? Why is it so tough to believe?. Don't you see hell around you nowadays.  I'll give you a good hint...Open your news paper and see how many people have died today of gunshot wounds.   Ask individuals who suffered from the World Trade Center attacks, what it felt like during that time.  I'm sure none of them will tell you "I was really happy, and it felt great yipeeee".  They will probably tell you that they were in HELL! . . I don't believe Christianity teaches that sex is the most awful, filthy thing on earth and you should save it for someone you love.  Where in Christianity does it teach that?  Did you hear that in church or did you hear that from the mouth of Christ?

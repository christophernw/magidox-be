The counselors that just sits and listens and nod their head are doing what is called active listening. They need to get as much info. from you as possible, before they can help. After so many visits they will start asking you questions. Counselors don't give advice. They try to help you to come with the answers. Some clients tend to not say everything that is on their mind. Sometimes because of embarassment or fear of judgement. The counselor is hoping that you will become comfortable with them.. . The one that told you her life story may of been trying to let you know she has been through tough times also. This is to help you understand that we are all humans with problems. Although this may of been her tactic she should never interrupt you. Interrupting you probably made you feel that your problems was not important to her, and you were only there so she can make money.. . I don't know if counselors would do this, but i would see if I could set up an interview with them and find out what kind of methods they use to help people. Don't ask the girl at the desk about the doctor she ofcourse will say he or she is a good one. . . Some counselors will send you home to do homework. Such as keeping a writing journal or audio journal. They will try to figure out what interests you, so you will do that homework. Good luck

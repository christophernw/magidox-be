Chickens have been bred to be good egg-layers, other birds haven't. For the most part, birds only lay eggs if they have mated, but chickens will lay eggs when they get old enough whether there's a male around or not. However, like some of the other answerers have said, some captive female birds will also lay eggs even if there are no males around. Reproduction is a very strong instinct.

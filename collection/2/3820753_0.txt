Dave in NC answered it perfectly.  Ill just add, if you are asking why tornados form over land- The rapid increase in heat needed to cause formation of tornados generally occurs only over land, since water modulates changes in heat.  However, sometimes they do form, but they are called waterspouts, and usually occur near hurricanes.

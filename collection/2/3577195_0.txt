60% of our body shape is genetic.  I know an asian girl who drinks 6 beers a night and is tiny.  Her metabolism will slow down if she does not eat right and exercise.  However, if she is genetically thin, she may gain some weight, but she will remain thin.. But remember, thin does not equal healthy!

Clearasil Ultra makes a cream that I think is the best for acne. It's called "Clearasil Ultra Acne Treatment Cream". It has 10% benzoyl peroxide in it so it works REALLY well! U should see results in about 3 days. Just put it on every night after u wash ur face. U should test it out first, when u don't have anywhere important to be, because a lot of people are allergic to it. Nothing really bad will happen if u are allergic to it, you'll just experience some dryness, redness, or inflammation. The best part is that u can get it at any drugstore. Examples:Walmart, Walgreens. But u HAVE to use it every night, or it won't work. I had acne in my t-zone for a long time, but now I barely ever get any acne!

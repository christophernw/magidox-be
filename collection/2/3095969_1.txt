i went to an elementary school with absolutely no extra-curricular activites. when i got involved in the arts i felt forsaken because everyone seemed to know more than me because of music and art programs in grade school.. . so it impacts heavily.. . in my opinion, athletics budgets should be cut. in my city, all everyone thinks about is sports. but when our choirs and bands win awards? there's no recogniton. >.<

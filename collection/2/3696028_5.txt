There are two reasons:. . (1) There are not as many impacts as there once was. What is called the "heavy bombardment period" ended about 4-4.5 billion years ago as the solar system reached close to it's present state. Jupiter, with it's large mass and resultant large gravity influence, has flung out most of the asteroids that crossed earth's orbit. The number has been slowly declining for the last 4 billion years.. . (2) However they do still hit. You can find examples at. http://www.solarviews.com/eng/tercrate.htm. However, while these are numerous, they happen on a geologic timescale. That means they are separated by millions and hundreds of millions of years. So the impacts are still happening. But they only happen on an infrequent basis. The Tunguska impact in Siberia was the largest that is recorded. Google Tungaska, Siberia, meteor to find more on it.. . You can also find a fun calculator to show the effect of different impacts on earth. The impact calculator is at . http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/impacteffects/. . Hope this helps. .

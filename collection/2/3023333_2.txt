Sliders are just really small hamburgers and they're usually steamed. I made sliders by forming medium meatballs and then flattening them or by pressing the ground beef mixture into a cookie sheet and then cutting rounds or squares with a small cookie cutter and then pan frying. They sell tiny buns in many stores.

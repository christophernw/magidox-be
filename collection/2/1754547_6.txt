Thought is accomplished in established patterns.  We train early to learn to read and so are able to stare at a book and get real communication without sounding out every word.  This is a layer on top of the layer of speech which is on top of .... you get my point.  To establish new patterns is the same as training to do anything else.  It takes practice.  Try this; commit yourself to doing something of a small  sacrifice  every time you catch yourself in a negative thought.  Then, every time you notice a new thought in positive outlook, do something of a small reward.  An example would be to give away a penny when you catch yourself in negatives and to put a penny in a piggy bank every time you catch a positive.  At the end of the week, go out for an ice-cream or dinner or movie.  Whatever the piggy can afford.  This way you don't count your failures but you do feel them, and you do count your successes and feel them too.. http://judgeright.blogspot.com

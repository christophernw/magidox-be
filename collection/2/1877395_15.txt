That's like asking, how come chimps are hairy when humans are not hairy or how come chimps are small while humans are big. It's just something they've evolved with, and it's something we have evolved with. . . We are related to all (or very close to, i don't know about all of bacteria) it of life on this planet as well, we all have dna and many other species have even some of the same organs as us, like hearts and kidneys. It's just that chimps are very closely related to us, somewhere around 98% or 99% of our DNA is the same.

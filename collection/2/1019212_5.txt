Because bigger breasts are a feature of the beauty canon established by our society. I'm not saying it's ethical, and I'm not defending any point of view, but technically that's your answer.. . Personally, I think if every girl had naturally large boobs, people would see that it's a good thing in every way. Obsession with big boobs has just become criticized and hated because it's an unrealistic obsession.. . If the new unrealistic beauty canon was to have small breasts, people would hate the obsession with small breasts and they would find reasons why it's unhealthy and wrong.. . The real problem is people. Peace out!!

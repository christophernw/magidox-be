You have to have 2 characters fall in love, first. You know - make them flirt and talk and kiss. Normal stuff. Once they've both achieved that "heart" rating for eachother, you make them both relax on the bed at the same time. Then, you select the other character for "Try for baby". (It's either that or "WooHoo", and it just happens.. can't remember.)

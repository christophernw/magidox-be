Holocaust comes from the Greek word holokauston, which means something that is "completely burnt".  Around 14th century A.D., it appeared in the English language to signify a sacrifice at an altar.. . So even though many Jews were slaughtered in ways other than burning, the word itself has some roots with that event in history.  It also just so happens that WWII was more recent, so the term is often associated to that as a result.. . Truth is that you can use whatever word you like that suits your preference.  If you want to call the 15-million plus Africans that lost their lives a Holocaust, then feel free to do so.  Call it genocide, murder, oppression, whatever so long as the message is clear.

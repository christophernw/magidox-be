according to anthropologists homo sapiens almost totally originated from Africa (the whole continent) and migrated to everywhere as we know now. perhaps, as we didnt have email, the telephone or porsches 1 million years ago, these people got isolated among these big groups that migrated everywhere (like asia, europe regions) and their set of communication sounds (ie, language) would develop to be unique from one another. hence you have dozens of different languages, and hundreds of dialects popping out everywhere in the world.

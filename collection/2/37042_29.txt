I have been considering home schooling my daughter for the fact that she has a learning disability and I have noticed she is not making progress at school. At the first of the school year last year I whent to an IEP meeting with my daughter where the teacher tolled me to my face that my daughter would never be a doctor or a scientist because of her learning disabilities. So all thrue the school year my daughter hated going to school she was being teased because she couldnt read and so forth. Well I  have decided to let her go one more year in the public schools to see if there will be a change if not I will home school her where she will have a  loving environment to where she can learn at her own pace and not be teased to the point of tears everyday.

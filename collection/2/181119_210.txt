Almost any position at an amusement park. Although the work tends to be hard and hot, or repetitive and boring, and the pay is not super, the people around you are having fun, laughing and altogether having a ball. You also get to see LOTS of people in skimpy clothes.  This can be both a blessing and a curse! :-)

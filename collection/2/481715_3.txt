The best way to rid yourself of bad breath is to practice good oral hygiene by brushing 2-3 times per day and by flossing at least once per day. Also make sure to visit your dentist every 6 months for an exam and cleaning. If you have persistent bad breath this is often a sign of periodontal disease and you should see your dentist for diagnosis and treatment.

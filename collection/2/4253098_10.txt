I'm guessing you mean interpolation related to digital cameras.  As you probably know a digital camera takes a photo with a resolution of a certain number of pixels (little dots).  Now say that you a dot of red nest to a dot of white a camera with interpolation will guess what a pixel in between these would be which logically would be pink and insert it in.  A camera without interpolation will just leave it as it is.  It is a method of trying to make a camera look better than it is.. . In Maths it is a method of estimating a point on a curve in between two known points.

During the revolutionary war the U S government tried that and it led to the saying "not worth a continental". That means that they printed so much paper that it became worthless.  After the 1st world war, Germany also tried it. People were hauling money to the store in wheel barrels to buy a loaf of bread. Germany was printing stamps with a value of 500 million marks to mail a letter. The next day they were printing stamps of 600 million marks to mail a letter. Italy also tried it.  When the lira became the official monetary unit of Italy it was worth 4.5 grams of silver. When the euro replaced the lira, the exchange value value was 1936 to the euro. . . You may not remember when a postage stamp was 3 cents but it was until about 1960. Since then our government's printing of dollars has made the postage stamp cost 39 cents. 13 fold decrease in the value of the dollar over 45 years.

at 17 you can work full time. However, even a community college gets spendy- $1000 for tuition and $300-500 for books....EVERY THREE MONTHS. You have to put away $500 a month just for tuition..which makes an apartment hard to keep. So if you can live with a relative, get a full time job and put as much into savings as you can while still payihng for your degree. In 2 years you'll have an AA and can transfer and have some money to help or you'll need to just work. . . Student loans often pay for housing, books, etc, but you of course have to pay them back.

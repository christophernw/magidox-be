The only way you can tell if someone is bipolar is if they fit certain criteria. No, one can NOT be half bipolar.. Depression is an illness which may be brought on by many causes. There are several different types of depression, and each are treated differently. For example, there is Situational Depression, Seasonal Depression, Major Depression, I believe there are 8 different kinds.. As for BPD(Bipolar disorder), or Manic Depression, one would have to have several features of this disorder, in order to be diagnosed with specific disorder. Bipolar is a cyclic disorder, where a person doesn't sleep for extended periods of time, are VERY active though not always productive, during those times, then after being awake for this period, basically crash... HARD. This is when the depression kicks in, and it's a DEEP depression... which lasts until the next cycle of mania occurs. Usually, this cycle is over several months, the highs followed by the lows. Thus my reason one can not be half bipolar. If you want to seek more knowledge, look into getting a book called the DSM-IV. It lists all of the criteria for each of the mental disorders.

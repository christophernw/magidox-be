The cough is probably just from the irritation of the drip.  You have two choices:  (1) Stop the drip: benedryl or other allergy med.  (2) Stop the cough: Try a product like Delsym (orange box, brown glass bottle) for 12 hour cough relief.  Take a drug holiday about every 2 weeks for a day or two, so it doesn't build up in you body.. . Oh, and some of it may be habit by now.  Try to stop.

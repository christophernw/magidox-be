It depends what you mean.  Originally, the cross (or crucifix)  was simply a convenient shape for an instrument of torture, to which a human body could be attached for a humiliating slow death.  It is its association with Jesus Christ which has caused us to see it as a symbol of suffering, and Christians therefore wear it as a reminder of Christ's sacrifice.    Other crosses, such as those found on flags were indicators of clans or nationalities.

Crude oil is the stuff pumped from underground; it is raw crude.  The only separation done to it is to siphon off the natural gases so only a liquid remains.  That is the stuff that is tracked by the price of a barrel (55 gallons).. . Then it is sent to a refinery to be cracked.  The cracking tower takes the raw oil and heats it up slowly.  Different products vaporize at different temperatures and are pulled off to other lines (which is why a refinery seems to be a mass of pipes they are all pumping different products.. . The most valuable product produced is Sweet Crude.. From the Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_crude. “Sweet crude oil is a type of petroleum. The word sweet refers to small amounts of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide; sweet crude generally contains less than 0.5% sulfur. This high quality, low sulfur crude oil is commonly used for processing into gasoline and is in high demand, particularly in the United States and China.”. . Crude Oil or raw Petroleum:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_Oil. Petroleum (from Greek petra – rock and elaion – oil or Latin oleum – oil ) or crude oil is a thick, dark brown or greenish liquid. Petroleum exists in the upper strata of some areas of the Earth's crust. It consists of a complex mixture of various hydrocarbons, largely of the alkane series, but may vary much in appearance and composition. Petroleum is used mostly, by volume, for producing fuel oil and gasoline (petrol), both important "primary energy" sources (IEA Key World Energy Statistics). Petroleum is also the raw material for many chemical products, including solvents, fertilizers, pesticides, and plastics. 88% of all petroleum extracted is processed as fuel; the other 12% is converted into other materials such as plastic. Since petroleum is a non-renewable resource, many people are worried about the consequences of its depletion. Due to its constant want in the world oil has occasionally been dubbed as the black gold.

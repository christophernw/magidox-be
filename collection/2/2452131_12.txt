Any attempt at trying to "Slow" down an electric meter - physically is called tampering and you can be prosecuted for it.  . . Try some conservation methods to reduce your electricity bill.  Turn off the TV when no one is watching.  Switch from electric stove/ranges to propane.  Try limit the use of "element" items like clothes dryers, blow dryers etc.  All this assuming that you have a current problem with your bill.. . You can do something about it, without doing something illegal.  Good Luck.

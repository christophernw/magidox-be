I don't know what Americans you've been talking to, and what exactly you mean by that, but I am an American and I call it a bathroom when I am home because that's what it is, the room with the bath in it that also happens to have the toilet in it where I do my *ahem* business, and when I am out in public I call it a restroom because it's much more cleaner sounding and more polite than "toilet". To me personally toilet sounds, I don't know, unclean, it's where you perform your most personal and rather messy body functions, no one needs to be reminded of that.

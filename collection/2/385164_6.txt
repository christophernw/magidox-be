There are only two legitimate all-breed registries in the US - the AKC and the UKC.. . There are two CKCs - the well respected Canadian Kennel Club and the thoroughly disreputable Contintental Kennel Club.. . Puppy millers and other irresponsible breeders who have been kicked out of the AKC for misconduct or produce dogs who don't meet the AKC's already low standards have created a confusing array of organizations like the CKC, APRI, NKC, etc. who will offer worthless "papers" to anyone who pays for them.. . Don't be fooled into thinking that a breeder is reputable just because they sell AKC registered dogs. Just this morning, I was out protesting a terrible puppy mill that sells most of their pups with AKC registration.. . It's great that you're doing some research before buying your next puppy! Consider adopting from a shelter or a rescue group. If you really have your heart set on a puppy, the best way to find a good breeder in your area is to find your favorite breed's local breed club and get a few breeder referrals from them.

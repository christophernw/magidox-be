Well said, sparkydog_1372.. . I appreciate your answer. Those people are very lazy, to turn on their indicators to warn ppl behind them. They are so lazy that they dont even care for others lives and move on. They break the lanes suddenly without even giving indicators. If we horn them to give us a side they deliberately block our road.. . They bride the traffic police thinking they are lords of the road. Road Safety rules should include compulsion of indicators(side & brake) instead of focusing on Helmets and Seat Belts.

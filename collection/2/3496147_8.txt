I think you're trying to be funny because I can't stop laughing!  Well you went wrong for many reasons.  First it's against the law to verbally threaten someone so you were acting like a criminal.  Another common sense thing is hello you're at a bank, that should speak for itself.  Anyway good try my friend I hope you find other ways to be like Jesus.  Maybe you should get up on the cross.

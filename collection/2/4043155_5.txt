Zion, or Sion (צִיּוֹן "Height", Standard Hebrew Tziyyon, Tiberian Hebrew Tsiyyôn; Arabic صهيون Ṣuhyūn), is an archaic term that originally referred to a specific mountain near Jerusalem (Mount Zion), on which stood a Jebusite fortress of the same name that was conquered by David. "Zion" came to be applied to the section of Jerusalem where the fortress stood, and after Solomon's Temple was built there, it came to refer to the temple grounds and the temple itself. Today "Zion" is often used metaphorically, to symbolize Jerusalem and the Promised Land to come, in which God dwells among his chosen people.

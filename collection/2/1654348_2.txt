Just know that their pain they felt here must have been so devistating that they could no longer bare it.For reasons we may never know or understand.Some people are just stronger than others.I had a friend who was only 11yrs, when she commited suicide. It is no ones fault and it will take time to heal the wounds we feel from events like this. Just remember to celebrate their lives in a postive way and don't get stuck in a rut on how they passed.There are support groups out there they you may want to check out. It is a very difficult and confusing issuen to deal with, I wish you luck in your grieving process.

If the others go astray, they cannot hurt you, as long as you are guided. To GOD is your ultimate destiny, all of you, then He will inform you of everything you had done.. http://www.submission.org/suras/sura5.ht.... . . No Compulsion in Religion . . [2:256] There shall be no compulsion in religion: the right way is now distinct from the wrong way. Anyone who denounces the devil and believes in GOD has grasped the strongest bond; one that never breaks. GOD is Hearer, Omniscient. [2:257] GOD is Lord of those who believe; He leads them out of darkness into the light. As for those who disbelieve, their lords are their idols; they lead them out of the light into darkness - these will be the dwellers of Hell; they abide in it forever. . http://www.submission.org/suras/sura2.ht.... . . Grossness of Murder . . [5:32] Because of this, we decreed for the Children of Israel that anyone who murders any person who had not committed murder or horrendous crimes, it shall be as if he murdered all the people.

Our messengers went to them with clear proofs and revelations, but most of them, after all this, are still transgressing. . http://www.submission.org/suras/sura5.ht... . . . . . Murder, Suicide, and Illicit Gains Prohibited . . [4:29] O you who believe, do not consume each others' properties illicitly - only mutually acceptable transactions are permitted. You shall not kill yourselves. GOD is Merciful towards you. . . [4:30] Anyone who commits these transgressions, maliciously and deliberately, we will condemn him to Hell.

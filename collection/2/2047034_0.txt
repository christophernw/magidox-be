Do aerobics on an empty stomach.  Get yourself a Taebo crunch video, or any aerobic video.  Do it before you eat breakfast.  Then, when you do your weights, if you do, make sure you run and stretch before lifting... squats for the butt and thighs, curls/tricep xtensions for the arms, push ups for the chest.

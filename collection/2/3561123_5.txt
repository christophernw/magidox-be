Yikes, you are harsh.  I think if the parents teach the kids how to behave in public, then they should be able to go anywhere with them.  I work in a restaurant and see parents letting the kids run around and getting under servers feet when holding hot coffee/food.  That is the parents fault.  There are plenty of people who have children who are well behaved, and the way they teach them is by taking them out.

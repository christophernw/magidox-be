This may be a genetical problem .i m very slim may be bcoz my parents r slim .there r many advertisements of weight loosing n there is no gurantee tht after using them ur weight wil be reduced .u should take a balanced diet .avoid oily things ,sweets ,chocolates etc n in place of sugar take sugar free also yoga is very helpful in reducing weight aayurvedically .but never use medicine as they can do sideeffects .but never be depressed bcoz of tht live ur life joyfully all tht matters at last .if ur health is not good then u should talk to the doctor

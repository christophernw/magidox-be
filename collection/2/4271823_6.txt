I think it does make sense for several reasons:. 1.  the greatest amount of heat is lost through the scalp;. 2.  water runs down the hair onto the neck, into the eves, nose, ears - thus interfering with our primal methods of communication;. 3.  hair on the back of the neck and upper back is small and very sensitive to changes in temperature and rain is uncomfortable here because such sensations cause a primal need for shelter to come to the forefront of our territorial and comfort needs.

Here's some background.  In certain battles during the early days of Islam, the non-believers were threatened by this new religion that was going to promote equality between mankind and, thus, would change their source of power and wealth.  . . These non-believers wanted to extinguish this new guidance whatever it took.  So they would gather tens of thousands of troops and march on the attack of the early Muslims.  These Muslims, only a few hundred in numbers with relatively little ammunition, had nothing to give them a glimmer of victory over the non-believing idolators except the promise of God on their side.. . Hence, they would scream "Allahu Akbar", which literally means: "God is greater than anything else".  This was the only way possible they would defeat their enemies; and by the grace of God, they did.. . Unfortunately, there have been many injustices and much oppression committed against Muslim nations in recent decades either by their own corrupt rulers or with the support of imperial governments like the U.S.  As a result, there has been a reactionary backlash to all this injustice.  There have also been many groups that have wanted to advance their own agenda, so they take advantage of the situation and hide behind the religious curtain in order to gain the support of the masses.. . It's kind of like when Israel calls Palestinian militants "terrorists", even though these Palestinians are fighting to secure their rights in their own homeland.  Israel uses this technique to attempt to draw a parallel between its situation and what happened on 9/11 in order to gain the sympathy of the West, specifically the U.S.. . Same thing with these extremists... They use Islamic slogans of old in order to justify their actions by calling it fighting in the name of God and in order to get the support of the public in that part of the world.

Tell them they need to read, and then turn off the t.v.. If they whine tell them to goto their room (unplug or move the t.v. if there is one in the child's room). If they start crying set times at which they can watch t.v.. If they start breaking out of the "time line" (no pun intended) spank them. If that doesn't work, send them to Dr. Phil, and let him tell you to spank them again.

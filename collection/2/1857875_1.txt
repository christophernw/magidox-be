Both the libs and the Conservatives do the same. They are the same party, they are the same career politicians who care about power over everything. Don't be fooled by the labels. Liberals are babies who whine about everything and still think it is the 60's. Conservatives want to tell you who you can pray to and screw. We need more third parties, more options.. but I have to admit, liberals use very little fact (if any) rely mostly on emotion not logic and believe whatever dribble Howard Dean or "fat boy" Moore says. Is easier for them to have someone else think for them, researching and finding fact is much to hard when American Idol is on or they have a "protest" to attend. Liberals are like children who just never grow up. Is very sad cause maybe if they could think as indivudals  and want true freedom we might make a change instead of reelecting a Democrat to replace a Republican to replace a Democrat to destroy Amerca a little more.

No such thing as getting it "easily" without masturbating.. . Pre-ejaculate (also known as pre-ejaculatory fluid or Cowper's fluid, and colloquially as precum) is the clear fluid that is issued from a man's penis when he is sexually aroused. The fluid is usually secreted by Cowper's glands during masturbation, foreplay or at an early stage during sex, some time before the man reaches orgasm and semen is ejaculated.. . Slang terms for pre-ejaculate include pre-come, pre-cum, dog water, speed drop, widower's tears, and clear stuff.. . As far as taste - you'll have to try it.

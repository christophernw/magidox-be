What are you feeding it?  Firstly, they cannot produce Vitamin C and MUST ingest this in the special guinea pig pellets available and fresh fruits/veggies high in Vitamin C.. . I fear you are needing much more then diet/nail trimming advice...please call the local vet, and ask them to refer you to someone who breeds, raises or rescues Guinea Pigs so that you can take your GP to them for evaluation, and so that you can become better educated as to this wonderful creatures needs.. .

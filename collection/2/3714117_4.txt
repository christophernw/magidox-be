On average, a pub focus more on beer and wine than liquors and cocktails. The food selections are better and the atmosphere more casual.. An average bar will serve more mixed drinks and have a fuller stock of hard liquors. Most don't serve meals, just snacks.. But it really doesn't make any difference nowadays, they are just watering holes for gatherings of one purpose or another.

i am hypoglycemic, when i eat, my sugar goes into the normal range, but if it was a real sugary meal, it will crash into the seventies, what you have sounds like type two diabetes, watch your diet, keep tabs on your sugar levels, check  them before and after each meal and before and after you sleep.  next time you go to the dr. show him your monitor.  your doc will probably order a battery of blood tests and begin treatment right away. typically, symptoms of diabetes include night sweats, shakes, excessive thirst and urination.... Good luck

I know exactly what you are going through because I went through it with my dog.  I lived in Germany, where they love animals and even allow you to bring your dog into resturants while you eat and everyone is practically in a dog club.  But when it came to wanting to rent an apartment, alot of owners said no because they were worried about the damage.  Finally someone gave us a chance after we offered to pay a little extra to the security deposit.  We also had to pick up his poo everytime he went around the area...but that is just a normal thing that all dog owners should do, no matter where they are at.  My advice for you is to be patient, look around some more and offer to pay a little more.  Luckily, by the time we moved in, our 100lbs lap dog was potty trained and very lovable to all.  Plus our next door neighbor also owned the same breed as us, so everyone already knew what to expect.  If you keep looking around, you might get lucky.. . If you want to move like right now and can't wait, then try to buy, either a condo or house...some condos are more reasonable in price then a house, if you aren't ready for that step just yet.  Above all things, don't get rid of your little bundle of joy just cause no one will rent to you because of him.  What ever you decide, good luck.

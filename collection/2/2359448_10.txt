One of the reasons I despise television reporters is they tell the unknowing public garbage to sell their advertising.  ANY United States military unit MUST, at all times, adhere to the rules of engagement laid down by the civilian government.  If anybody tells you otherwise, they are as full of shite as a Christmas turkey!  Retired USAF colonel.

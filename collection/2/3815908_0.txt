When I was in school I was told of the several ice ages that the world went through.  In the Seventies the same people that were worried about global cooling is now worried about global warming.  This makes me incredibly skeptical about global warming.. . It is a fact that when a volcano blows that there are more pollutents sent into the air.  Now we can't stop volcanoes.  We can't stop hurricanes that have existed since the begining of time.  How can we stop something that we have no control over?  We can't.

You are talking about a decrease of 30 Kg which is a lot. So you have to be careful not try to loose in a very short span because you will gain that right back in addition to side effects. Regular excercise, walking/running daily atleast for 30 minutes and a consistent diet will be helpful. Try not to take Carbs at night. Do not cut fats altogether as they help you to feel satisfied. And you tend to eat less. Hope that helps.

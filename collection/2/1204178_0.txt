I just had a root canal yesterday. it sucked. and its still pretty sore. Ive had 6 root canals already and Im only 28. if the dentist used any metal in your filling that could be why it still hurts. I forget what that kind of pain is called but it sometimes feels like an electric shock and its got something to do with other nerve endings in your head. but if your upped tooth is still just sore from the procedure then it makes sense that you still have referred pain in your lower tooth. either that or you need a new dentist. take some motrin.

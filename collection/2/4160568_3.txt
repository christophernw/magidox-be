DUDE, I have family documentation that states that I have ancestors on my father's side were Native American and my Great Grandmother who passed away 8 1/2 years ago (also my 1st best friend EVER) was one fourth Native American and she had the physical characteristics of a Native American (black hair like silky thread, slanted eyes, the skin tone; I ALWAYS thought that she was white; and bent forefingers, you know, the part of the finger with the nail) and her mother who passed away almost 12 years ago had EXACTLY the same characteristics as her, but she was half Native American.  So when someone tells you that they're part Cherokee, part Sioux, part Iroquois, or part whatever, then it PROBABLY is true!

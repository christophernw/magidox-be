If you go to the supermarket and look at all the different types of beef cuts, you will see that some cuts have more white streaks of fat embedded within the actual "meaty" portion of the flesh than do other cuts. A cut that has streaks of fat is considered to be "marbled". . . From what I understand, many people prefer the marbled varieties. They prefer it, I suppose, because with the fat being embedded within the cut (instead of being lopped all on the side) the meat remains (more) tender as it's being cooked.. . I, myself, don't like all that fat in the meat. So it's all in personal preference. Hope this helps.

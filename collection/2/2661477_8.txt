The Bulbis Glandis is the name of the actual part of the penis that swells...it is located a bit up from the tip..right about in the middle. The tie originated as a way for the male dog who breeds the bitch to ESNURE that his sperm has enough time to travel up the cervix and fertilize her eggs...thus insuring HIS genetic legacy is passed on. Bitches can have a litter sired by 2 or more different dogs...so this is why the male will "guard" her, follow her and tie with her as often as she will allow. To increase HIS chances of siring all her pups and DECREASE the chances of other males doing the same.. . The back to back position adopted to keep them both safe as they are vulnerable to predators at this time...two sets of teeth at either end :). . The fact that most matings are controlled by people hasn't yet changed this aspect of dogs. Wolves breed in exactly the same manner.

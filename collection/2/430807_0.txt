You get an incredibly big ink pad (in this case you need blue) and an incredibly big sheet of paper... Press the room on the ink pad and then press the room on the paper. VOILA.. a blue print.. No actually.. Blue prints are very rarely used nowadays.. It's all CAD stuff (Computer aided design).. Back along drawings were made on tracing paper and then set on a stencil type copying machine to make copies.. The ink was blue and they were called blue prints.. So. if you want to make one you must find some tracing paper. Measure your bedroom and all the bits in it, putting on dimensions etc and then find an architect or civil or structural engineers who still have this kit and see if they will print a couple out for you.. Bingo.. A blue print.. A local science museum may have one.

You need to have the game on the PSP and the PS2 for interactivity.. . You can use the PSP as a media drive (not UMD THOUGH) by linking the USB ports through an Action Replay pack.   If you have this running on a hacked PSP you MAY be able to stream UMD ISO from Memory Stick through the PS2 to TV. Other than that they really have nothing to do with each other.

Early Pagans used rabbits(particularly white ones)as a sign of the purifying of the land during springtime. Rabbits are very fertile creatures and so came to represent fertility and rebirth. The myth of the bunny bringing gifts is a more modern one and probably dates to Eastern European folklore. It was common practice in early societies to give a gift to represent new growth in nature.

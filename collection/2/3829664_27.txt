http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas. . I celebrate Christmas because I believe in the Birth of Christ.  Christmas is about all things good and holy.  Its about loving and giving of ourselves to others in need.  The spirit of the season is of joy and peace to be shared with all.  This is why I celebrate Christmas.  Anyone can join in and celebrate Christmas it captures peoples hearts its a great time of year for sharing with family and friends.  Enjoy, God Bless and Merry CHRISTmas!!!

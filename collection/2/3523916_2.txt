You have to pay MORE than the minimum payment every month to pay off the principal. Anything over-and-above the minimum goes to pay down your principal.. . If you are disciplined and have the income to support it, an interest-only ARM can be a good way to pay off the debt, since you can pay off the principal up-front. (I have one, and I'm glad I did it.) I have NEVER paid only the minimum amount in any month, EVER. I'll have my $100K mortgage paid off in less than 15 years, for a fraction of what a conventional mortgage would have cost me.

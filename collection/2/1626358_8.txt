Unless you are a congressional district unto yourself, your vote doesn't mean diddly-squat.  We will just send the same citizens into office, make politicians out of them and watch them die as tax-fattened hyenas.  The citizens of this country may think that their representatives have our best interests in mind, ask yourself this; when was the last time your congressman came and knocked on your door and asked you if it was ok if he voted himself a pay raise?  Enough said.

It depends on how much surveillance you need.  I know that there is a "Spy Shop" in town here where you can just buy those baseball caps with hidden cameras for $50.  If it's in one room you could just buy one of those and sit it on a desk or table or dresser! I mean you probably don't need anything very detailed she's probably the only adult there at the time so you know if a "tall" person (not a child) is grabbing something and stashing it ... it has to be her!

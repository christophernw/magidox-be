I have a 7 month old golden retriever that had the same problem. Here is what i did that seemed to work extremely well:. . I went to the pet store and found him 3 different types of toys, since i realized that he was getting bored with the only squeeky toy he had so far. Remember, dogs have extreme A.D.D. so you have to trick them.. . Move your shoes to a higher level, and put the new toys where your shoes used to be. Soon, he should start to feel like he wants to chew on the toys instead of the shoes.. . Try it and tell me if it works, it worked great with my pup.

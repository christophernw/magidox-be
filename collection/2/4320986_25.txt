Just because someone has a different believe, it does not mean that they are genuinely good people. When someone refused to do something, it is because they believe it to be wrong. Sure, they may not get caught all the time, but they still have to live with that shame. Though they may not believe that the will be punished in the afterlife, everyone knows that life is beetter when you follow the rules.. For myself, I don't know why people find this to be so confusing. I want to be treated in a nice manner just like everyone else, therefore I treat people with respect. It's a matter of keeping order and a clean conscience. . It is the same for "god fearing people". Why are they alcoholics, hardly go to church or talk about people behind their backs? People are people no matter what they believe. You'll have some that will follow the rules because they need that piece of mind and what order, then you have some that just dont care and what to have all the fun they can find.. I hope that helps.

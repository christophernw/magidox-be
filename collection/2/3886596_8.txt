I think it is great that there is a state that won't fall protocol to another ridiculous law the govt has placed on us citizens. The only reason they created Daylight Savings Time was to create longer daylight hours to try and figure out their income tax system. Arizona doesn't need the extra hour of daylight....they have plenty! Even though I was raised in Mich that DID recognize DST, my grandmother who lived with us, DIDN'T !!!

A proper baptism takes placed with one is submerged in that they are being baptized in.  In the 3rd Chapter of Matt we find Jon the Baptist preaching/teaching concerning three different baptisms, each bringing about a different conclusion.  John stated "I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire."  At this same Christ submitted to the being baptized by John as an example of that water baptism takes place when one is dunked or submerged in water.  Now, it does matter if it is a river, a baptismal pool or tub, for it is not the water that makes it holy, but the sacrament.  Still, when one is baptized it is an outward show of an inward change.

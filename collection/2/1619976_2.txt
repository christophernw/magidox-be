I have to agree with Lani S, as a sport animal.  The same as the fox and rabbit in Australia.  The gentry were responsible for the introduction as the Stag and Hind were the prime sporting animals of the English Gentry who settled Australia and New Zealand.  That is prior to them coming to the countries.  The Red Deer did not really take to Australian conditions, but New Zealand was ideal.  Hence, you guys over there should be exporting your blood stock back to England at very inflated prices to ensure that England's blood stock is ensured.

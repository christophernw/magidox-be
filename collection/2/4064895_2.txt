I had h.pylori, you do not have to have an ulcer to have this but it causes ulcers from what I understand.  I had this 1 year ago. I kept feeling real nauseous. I never did get sick but I described to my Dr. that it was like morning sickness.  I lost about 20 lbs.  When the Dr. finally did blood work and it came back that's what I had, he put me on 2000mg of an antibiotic per day.  What is strange is my Dad had H pylori about 3 months after me he almost bled to death.  We had been on a cruise a month before my symptoms started!

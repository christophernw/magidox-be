A leaky mitral valve (also called mitral insufficiency or mitral regurgitation) causes some of the blood to be pumped in the wrong direction (ie from the left ventricle back into the left atrium), instead of flowing only into the aorta. This means that for a particular amount of squeeze the heart is less efficient. This can lead to multiple problems including congestive heart failure and hypertrophy (enlargement) of the heart muscle.

agnostic here who studies this like an hour a day cause im trying to figure it out. . bible says god made animals on day 5. on day 6 he made man with his own hand out of dust and clay. . evolution is saying man came over the course of years and years and was an apeish creature before he was man. . so evolution doesn't disprove god, it disproves the fundamentalist christian believe that god made animal on day 5 and man on day 6 without any intermediate steps but from dust and clay

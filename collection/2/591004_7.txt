A tip is seen as a reward for fine service.  It once was an accronym for "To Insure Prompt Service."  I tip according to the service and if I get lousy service I leave a lousy tip.  It is not an entitlement.  If you want entitlements, giving up the chance of the extra generous tip, then get out of the service industry and work for wages.

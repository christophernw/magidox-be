Your question made me laugh. Not laughing at the annoyance you are going through. But a funny memory of what my Father-In-Law did when his neighbors dog was a barker. The dog barked all day long because the neighbors kept him in the back yard while they were at work. The dog had a nice dog house, full run of the yard and plenty of water and toys in the back yard. So the dog wasn't really barking out of boredom. But missed his owners and wanted attention. So one morning my Father-In-Law threw some left over bacon over the fence and said in a stern voice "Shut Up". He continued to do this for about a week. Yes, every morning the dog continued to bark. You could tell the dog was at the same spot by the fence. My Father-In-Law would throw bacon over the fence and say in his usual stern voice "Shut Up". There after the dog only barked for his bacon or treat. Once he got his treat from over the fence he wouldn't bark for the rest of the day or evening, until breakfast time.  Give this a try, see what happens. Good luck :)

Make something for her yourself.  Choose a craft and try to do something she might like.  You could collect things from nature (like a branch) and carve something. Perhaps make a nice display of pine cones.  I can't stop laughing....  Clean her windows for her.  No that's me...I've got nothing to be honest.

If you did it yourself, you could have put it in backwards.  But if your car was overheating which is why you changed it in the first place, then the thermostat wasn't the problem.  Sometimes something as simple as a radiator flush will fix overheating problems.  If you have a 97, you probably need a flush very badly if it never has been done.  . You should flush your radiator every 5 years.  . Other things to check:. Does your fan kick on?. Is your coolant level correct?. Is there a white milky residue in your radiator (fungus)?. Does your radiator cap close properly (the spring in the cap is responsible for regulating the correct pressure). Is your coolant sensor working properly?

NO!  It's NOT true!  (P.S. to boredgal:  Can I be you when I grow up?). . The "common" cold is a collection of well over 200 different viruses.  One of the reasons that we may never "cure" it is because it's so hard to identify exactly which virus you have and because viruses are constantly mutating.. . So even if this was true (and it's NOT) the effect wouldn't last very long.. . The only thing EX is a cure for is a normal life.

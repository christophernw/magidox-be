It is more from a sense of Southern pride now than anything else. Many in the south feel that the war and the reasons for it have unfairly prejudiced the nation against us and it is a way to show that we still have a sense of honor and pride that cannot be taken away. One thing that it is important to know and people should always remember is that only around 2% of the people in the south before the civil war owned slaves .... most were simple share croppers and the like who were often no better than slaves themselves in many ways. It was never really the "southerners" that caused slavery .. it was, just like now, the rich man that was the root of the evil.

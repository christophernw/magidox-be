Evidently, you either love Sacha BC or you hate him. You either think he's hilarious or you entirely don't see the joke.. That doesn't stop the fact that "Borat" is the biggest success in film comedy history (just about) and you will be seeing Sacha BC in just about everything for the next five or ten years.. Israel-kidding would not have been politically correct, but by aiming at Kazakstan, he has somehow hit a nerve with just about every racist in the world.....whether they are laughing at the subject-matter or with his once-removed sending-up of racists themselves remains to be seen.. Like "The Life of Brian" this is a film that people just feel they must see and must laugh at.. His justification is not that he's racist, but that he is laughing up his sleeve at racists. Many people would say that those two things are almost the same.

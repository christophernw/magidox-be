Well that is easy because I have three cats and after the first two the third went by like that. .      What I do is that I take a squirt bottle and everytime the cat gets on my counter I squirt him. Say down when you do it though because there will be a time where your cat will come walking down your counter and you dont have time to get out that squirt bottle you say no. They know what that means after being told that in training. .      Well good luck and hope it works for you! =)

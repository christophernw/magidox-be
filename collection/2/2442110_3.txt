This is really funny.  Do Americans really think we're a bunch of clods?  Or that we have strange customs?  Ok, well, my mother always made gelatin with fruit that was served with the main meal.  My husband thinks that's weird.  . . Be polite, friendly and helpful and don't hog the stuffing.  You'll do fine.  Just remember to close the igloo door behind you when you come in.

Prophesy and speaking in tongues as well as all the church teaching from the Old Testament are all obsolete.  Why would you follow what was written by primitive cultures of 1000's of years ago without regard to the knowledge we have accumulated since then?  God gave you a brain, so take your head out of the Scriptures and live your life.  It's not in a book.  Write your own book.  It's such a same to waste your life with such nonsense.  Jesus did have the idea of loving others right, just do that and leave the crazy talk alone.

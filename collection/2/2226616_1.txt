Yes a hammer would kill it. It would also make alot of mess and be pretty brutal.. Why not try and catch it? Homebase sell mouse traps that will just catch the mouse in a trap so you could set it free somewhere else. They also sell traps that can kill them with poison. Or yes the hammer if you cant be bothered but I think thats a bit cruel and it will make mess.

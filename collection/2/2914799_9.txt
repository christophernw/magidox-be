if you love yourself for trying to be yourself without caring what other people think of you, because it's better to love yourself for who you are than to be perfect - if that exist - and not love yourself. there is really nobody close to perfect and most people dont care about it - don't get down on it because you are sensitive for it, just try to love yourself for who you are and try to be happy.

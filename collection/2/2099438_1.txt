There are mucous membranes in your lungs that produce the "snot" in the same way your saliva glands produce saliva. When you are sick, these membranes are inflammed and irritated and they produce more mucous than usual.. . This is why we cough -- we cough because our body is trying to expel the excessive mucous from inside our lungs. It's that little tickling sensation you get right before you cough or sneeze.

My friend Greg's answer to why he reads disturbing true-crime stories:. . "I just wish I knew what it is that makes people do incomprehensible things.". . He was mostly talking about the rapists and murderers, I guess.  I think that that's a lot of the reason that people read those stories:  when someone gets hurt, people want to know why.

I live in Canada where we have 2 official languages.  It's because both English and French speaking peoples played such an important role over the centuries in creating our wonderful country.  While we do have our problems with this at times, I think it's great that not just one particular group is recognized for its role in the creation of Canada.  All our ancestors built this country.  In both languages.  I don't understand why some Americans would be afraid to have a second language.  It's merely a reflection of the diverse society.  It doesn't mean that everyone has to learn the 2nd language.  Like it or not, the Spanish speaking people have helped to build America over the centuries.  Especially in the border states that are so rich in both cultures.

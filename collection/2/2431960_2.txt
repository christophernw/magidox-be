There are tons of scholarships that go unclaimed each year.  Many $400, $500 or $1000 scholarships never even get applied for because people think it's chump change and not worth applying for.  Well, get a few of those $500 scholarships and it'll really make a dent in your tuition bill.. . Do a search on scholarships, search your major, your ethnic heritage, your town, your parents employers, your employer, hobbies, high school, local chamber of commerce/rotary/lion's club etc.  Go to the library and ask the reference librarian for a reference book on scholarships.  They usually have more than one.  There are all kinds of scholarships out there, you just have to start applying yourself and make it your summer career to send out letters everyday for scholarships.  Good luck!

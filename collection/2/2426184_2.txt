The remote wire and power wire can be together without a problem. You dont want your RCA cables anywhere near other wires that carry electricity. The best place for RCA cables is down the middle of your car and keep them away from any other wires that may be in its route. The best place for a ground wire is straight to the frame of the car or if you have a dry cell battery, ground it to that but make sure the battery is also grounded to the frame.

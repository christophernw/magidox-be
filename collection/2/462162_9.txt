By "we" I assume you mean the US. We do share, we send billions of dollars every year to countries around the world in humanitarian aid. The problem is not that people do not share, but that the people in control of these countries are crooks. It's documented that many countries in Africa, for instance, the government takes the aid money, and keeps it. Or takes the Red Cross food supplies that are supposed to be for the people, and sells it for money. Until these countries can be cleaned of corruption, there will always be hunger.. . Cheers :)

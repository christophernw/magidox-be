In this artice you read the writer was expressing his/her opinion but that doesn't mean its so-we teach languages in public schools and to enter the corporate world the learning of languages such as German,Chinese,Japanese etc is encouraged so the write of this article was expressing a biased untrue opinion-not factual. Since American culture is established there really is no threat against it-it already is what it is.  The writer may have been in favor of  Spanish being a "required"language because there are now so many immigrants esp.illegal here now-why should it be a "required"language-it's already being taught in public schools and anyone wanting to learn Spanish can without any fear whatsoever  BUT this is America and our language is English  so anyone coming here should learn to speak English-and that's the way it is with every other country/nation in the world-each country has it's established language and people who come to the country learn this native language.

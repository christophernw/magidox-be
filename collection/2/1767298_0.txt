You are NOT going to want to do this, and you will not like doing it, but it will work - you will be amazed at how quickly and how well.. Mix one teaspoon of salt with a cup of warm water.  If you have an eyedropper, get it.  If not, use a spoon.  Lie down on a bed on your back with your head hanging off the bed.  (Trust me, I KNOW this sounds kind of crazy but it works.)  Use the eyedropper or teaspoon to funnel the salt water into your nostrils.  Fill them up as much as you can stand - the more the better.  It is going to burn some - deal with it.  Lie there for as long as you can possibly stand it.  You'll still be able to breathe, so don't worry about that.  When you just can't stand it, get up.  Have plenty of tissues handy cos you'll need them.  The water will drain out - and in about five minutes so will everything else!  It works every time.  At first you'll feel stuffier.  And after that - look out!  It'll all come out.

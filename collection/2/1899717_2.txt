Because Hispanics are the largest growing section of people and they will vote in droves if their community and church comes out and praises a certain politician. And politicians will not hurt a key demographic.. . Nothing really happened to our laws, our laws aren't being inforced. We're spending billions of dollars on a war halfway across the world. If we spent a 10th of the budget we spend on that war, we'd be able to protect our borders properly.. . Getting lazy? No, many people would like to have those jobs but rich businessman have always been looking for a way to save money and cut costs. You could relate it to slavery. What did rich men do to save money? Round up a bunch of "savages", throw em on a boat and make them work for free.. . Now we have men who don't wanna pay the minimum wage or insurance for legal immigrants or citizens, they don't wanna worry about people reporting them to the government for unsafe working conditions so they continue to hire illegals.. . As far as welfare, there's no reason to waste the money on training. Most illegals work jobs that are basically labor. Even if employers agreed to employ unemployed welfare recipients, most people on welfare would still need food stamps or a small government check just to survive.

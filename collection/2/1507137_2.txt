You have to be sure of what you're asking- why girls don't play video games, or if they do, and you're just not seeing them play them.. . The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) have done surveys and studies on gameplayers and buyers. It goes on to list that the average buyer is 40 years of age, the average gamer is 33 years of age, and 50% of all Americans play video games- that's a rather large chunk out of the population, and it's a longshot to assume that part of that chunk doesn't include girl-gamers.. . Surveys have been conducted to disprove that gamers are predominantly male. While it is true that the average consumer nowadays is 20-30 years old and male, more and more female gamers are being found. A few studies claim that females outnumber males in Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs), and the ESA backs this by claiming that, while not outnumbering females, 48% of the MMO population is female. A substantial number do play games provided by internet services (like word jumbles and puzzles). Perhaps one of the most popular games noted for being played premarily by females is "The Sims" series, which is effectively a Life-simulator.. . Even if one disregards this, a number of the most popular video game characters have been female in the past: Lara Croft is one example of sexuality combined with hardcore action and adventure; Samus Aran was a character in Metroid whom every person played thinking she was a male until the very end. It's becoming something of a more attractive theme to have females that play the role of action heros or are otherwise the main characters, rather than males, while simultaneously disregarding the stereotype that all video game females are damsels in distress.

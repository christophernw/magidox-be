aww i know how you feel! i stay up late doing homework too partially becuase i cant buckle down and do it for a long time and partly becuase im just slow at it. i go to bed usually anytime from 10 on a good day to 12 but i dont feel the effects that you are feeling i can run on 3 hours of sleep and still be fine. well enough about me... try your hardest to finish your homework as soon as possible and work on it as soon as you get home. also, if there are times at school when you are able to get it done, do it or try to finish as much class work as you can so you will have less to do at home. hang in there buddy you can do it !  :). . have a great thanksgiving and get some rest this weekend!

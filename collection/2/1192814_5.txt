whatever works for you - i imagine it is different for everyone.  probably as many different scenarios as possible unless you like to deny yourself self-expression and comfort.  i think most people dream of jobs where they can be themselves, mates and partners and families that they don't need to pretend to be someone else around just to please them.  sometimes it's a good learning experience to be in a situation that is not comfortable because it forces you to learn about yourself, but if it was all the time, it would be rough.

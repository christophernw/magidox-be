American citizens are of all colors and of every race on planet Earth.  Yes, I am of European origin, but Americans of European ancestry are only one group among many ethic and racial groups that make up the great body of American citizens, and I treasure each and everyone of them.  It is an insult to ALL American citizens to try to make the immigration issue a racial one.  The immigration issue has nothing whatever to do with race, and the attempt to merge it with Dr. Martin Luther King's great legacy is a slap in his face.. . I wonder what the U.K. representative is doing here, and I question whether EVERYONE in the U.K. works hard.

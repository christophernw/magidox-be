Teleportation - the ability to teleport myself and a few things near me (if desired) to another location instantly.. . Besides the convenience factor of no travel time, think of the ability to help others in trouble.  You could see someone live on TV, say stuck in a well or something and be able to teleport right to them and then back out with them "in tow".. . Or for "evil" purposes, you could just teleport into a bank vault...

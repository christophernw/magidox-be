If they would disown their own child, then the children can always come home to me.  :-)   Auntie Nik has a nice ring to it!   :-D  Sorry, just feeling very "motherly" lately.. . It's the people who distort, contort and "rape" the religion into something it may not be originally.  Answerer Southflorida(?) has it right---it's the people who do this, not the religion.   Granted, some tenents of christianity I don't agree with and do think it gives "bad advice"......but imho, it's mostly the people who distort things around as they don't understand bible is allegorical, not literal.

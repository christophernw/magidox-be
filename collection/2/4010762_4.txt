You will get the runs if you are after drinking a glass of milk.. Being intolerant, is not the same as allergy - you merely lack the ability to digest lactose or milk protein(because your body can't produce lactase) so it doesn't coagulate and just runs through your digestive system and out the other end.There should be no other symptoms as have been suggested.

If you daydream a lot then your brain probably just wants some stimulation. If you do something that is a bit challenging or new, something you'll need to focus on, I don't think you'll daydream while you're doing that. It's when your brain has nothing to do or is bored that it starts dreaming, just to keep busy and to get some stimulation.. . I daydream a lot myself. I don't usually mind it, although it can be annoying when I want to concentrate on something. I notice that I usually start daydreaming when I'm bored or not really interested in what I'm doing, or when what I'm doing is too easy for me.

It's easy, Americans want to have their own identity, they want to forget their roots, the fact, that they're originated from Europe, mostly British. Plus, they're too proud with what they gained now, especially on technological advancedments.. . I guess, the real Americans is the native Americans; those Cheerokees and other natives there. Beside them, others are colonisers that try to take advantages towards the wealthyness of the land. It is not too far to say that, Americans try to eliminate those natives systematically. Same things do happen to Maoris in New Zealand.

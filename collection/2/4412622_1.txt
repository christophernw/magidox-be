They're not being used by any law enforcement agency in my area, the local police department and sheriff's department stopped using them after some legal problems caused by misuse. (administering repeated stun gun and taser shocks to an unconscious epileptic). . Low lethality would be a better designation, I've survived shocks of over 30,000 volts at over one ampere with nothing more than burns and pulled muscles from the involuntary contactions all over my body. (yes, it hurts. :( ) an overweight, doped up and stressed subject may die from a shock, but he could also die from a heart attack or stroke while resisting officers.

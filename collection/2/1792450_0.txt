as a young soldier in viet nam i had occasion to visit the humble homes of many vietnamese. i'd listen to them speak this strange language .and as candel light flickered shadows on there strange faces, i wondered what strange mystical things they were talking about.   now iam fortunate to have returned to viet nam and again visit the homes of many people... but now i speak the language and their "strange, mystical conversation goes something like this , "  where have you been all day, you knew we were having guests, i could have used some help prepairing... did you bring home the beer...?"...... id say NOT UNDERSTANDING language can frame the perception of he world , yes.....

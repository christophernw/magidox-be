A flow of electrical current consists of the unidirectional (on average) movement of many electrons. . Water only causes damage if its resistance to the electrons is smaller than the material used to guide the movement e.g. wires and such. . The water will also connect parts not meant to be connected and therefore cause damage. . Furthermore the water -once evaporated- will leave its minerals which will continue to misguide the current and also cause corrosion. . For sabotage purposes I would suggest the use of salt water or urine :D

You need to what we call backflush or reverse the flow of the coolant in the system. as the engine gets hotter ther thermostat located usually near the top of the engine will open and allow coolant to flow to the radiator where it then falls through the channels and the mving air passing through the radiator cools it, so your coolant flows in this direction to remove impurities you have to reverse the flow.  Remove the thermostat and then force water the opposite way round the system including the radiator, you can add a flushing compound but the most important thing is to continue witth this until you get clear water, when finished refit the thermostat and new gasket/seal if it has one and then add the correct amount of antifreeze and top off with water til it reaches the level required, run vehicle with the heater on hot until normal operating temp is reached and then very very carefully using a rag gently remove the pressure cap to check the level, if it is low use warm water to top it up as this will avoid a coolant shock to any of the alloy components and gaskets in the engine.  It is a time consuming process taking on average 40 mins to complete successfully

I worked at the library reshelving books.  It was a great job.  They paid me more than minimum wage, I had flexible hours and it wasn't a difficult job.  Working at the library was a really great opportunity because not only did I get paid to re-shelve books, but I learned about all of the many resources that are available, not just books and magazine articles.  I changed into a position in the children's department and then got paid to help kids play educational computer games.  What fun!!

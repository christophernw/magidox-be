You would have to understand ground combat first.  It takes higher levels of manpower, logistical support, and planning.... especially when you look at the fact that most insurgents only stay in place 6 to 12 hours at a hard location.  The average ground assault mission takes 4 to 6 hours to plan out, if you have good, relevent, and current intelligence about the target and the surrounding area.  The risk factor is also weighed each time a mission is planned out.  There is less risk associated with an airstrike than there is with a ground operation. The insurgents know as per fact that we are very good at ground combat... that is why the weapon of choice is the IED.  They don't seem to want to do heads up combat with us..  Then you have to understand terrorism.  The terrorist wants the biggest bang for the buck. The most shock factor with the least amount of liability. Hence why they don't want, nor can afford a standing army, in uniform, that they as an organized group have to support. They have not the will nor ability to fight a heads up battle.  In the few face to face encounters we have had with both Al Queida and the Taliban, they have walk away or been carried away wishing they hadn't tangled with us at that time.  One of our platoons from the engneers (a 19 man element)... not infantry... took down a 37 man Taliban patrol in a chance encounter.  It was discipline, bravery and technology that afforded us the upper hand.

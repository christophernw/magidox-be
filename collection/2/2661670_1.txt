Any reason they want to. My problem with high school was that i was smarter than the teachers, proven with special assessment scores for a psychological examination. My tenth grade year i was shown to have the intellect of someone in their 2nd year of graduate school. I figured they couldn't teach me anything I couldn't learn in a book, so i might as well not go and read about the things i need to know.

This question is vague - I don't recognize it as a particular piece of religious or secular writing.. . So I am going to assume you are asking a philosophical question.. . I find it easiest to understand forgiveness as putting myself in the other person's shoes to try to understand what they were thinking.  Add to that, learning from the experience.. . If I understand why someone may, for example, have betrayed a confidence, I can forgive that.  I can learn from this by not telling this individual my secrets, thus respecting their limitation.. . This is as concrete as I can get with a philosophically challenging question.

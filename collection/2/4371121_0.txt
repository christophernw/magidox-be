They probably look at you like that because they know you can kick there butts, so they give you the stare, to let you know that if you come in fighting, they are not going to back down, even if you do want to fight and they lose.. . Either that, or you are reading it all wrong.  Why don't you find out their names and when you see them say hello.  That way they won't be worried about you, and won't feel the need to try and stare you down....

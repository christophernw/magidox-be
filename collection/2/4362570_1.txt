Structural Engineering is a subspecialty of Civil Engineering (kind of how a plastic surgeon is doctor that specializes in cosmetic and reconstructive surgery). A Structural Engineer deal with the structural analysis of structures such as building, bridges, dams, walls etc.. A civil Engineer can elect to become a Structural Engineer as a specialty. Most general Civil Engineers are involved in land development, surveying and also do light structural design (i.e. wood structures under 3 stories, wall and structures that are not government buildings, hospitals)

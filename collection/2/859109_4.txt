Start with the Math - work out wall/ceiling areas so you can see how many cans of paint you need. Then add an extra can, plus a gallon of turpentine.  Add 1/4 the cost of all your equipment used - your paint brushes/rollers, covers, etc (so you use them four times then replace them).. Work out all these as costs.. . Then work out how many hours it takes to do the job. Multiply it up by your hourly rate.. . Add them together and add tax.. . Hope that helps

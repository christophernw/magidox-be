OK society/the media 2 tell u that if u ever Have an erection when around a guy or feel "strange" around that person u are gay and u can't change it. Forget them and pray every one has felt "weird" around someone of the opposite sex but it doesn't mean they're gay.. . P.S. PRAY PRAY PRAY there is no real gay love it's either need for sex, like they do in jail , or mixed up thoughts or emotions

The amount of capital you need depends entirely on what kind of car wash you intend to establish.. . There are far too many variables to even begin providing a valid answer.. . Price & availability of land, construction costs, laws & rules that govern the operation, variable costs (utilities maintenance, labor, etc) , fixed costs (rent, taxes, maintenance, etc.), and other factors all determine how you would get started and how much capital would be required.

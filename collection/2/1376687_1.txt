Acutely you can there is a observatory in Arizona that shots a laser (green) at the moon every other day, The laser hits a mirror on the surface of the moon, (which Apollo 10 placed there), the beam is then reflected back and tells use how far the moon is from use what it's current stellar drift is and any one can go to this observatory and witness this.  This is not fiction it's fact and there can be no other explanation for how a man made mirror with nothing else around it but a u.s. flag and some foot prints got there.  Believe me when I say some people just cant except fact it has to be a conspiracy if it where the Russians would have called us out on it already, remember this was all going on during the cold war and the great space race.

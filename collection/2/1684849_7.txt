I used to beleive that tolerance was a good thing... Im atheist. . . Im beginning to change my view on that. Why should I be tolerant of a religion that infringes upon my right to live life how I see fit?? Why should I be tolerant of a religion that says it will kill me if I do not accept it as the truth? Why should I be tolerant of people who beleive that the End is Near - and thus could care less about the environment (BUSH Administration)?? . . Tolerance is over rated.... I fear if I am too tolerant, some muslim will end my life, or some Christian will make a law banning homosexuality and Red Lobster (eating shellfish).

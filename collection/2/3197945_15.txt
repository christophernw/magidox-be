How do the French pronounce Van Gogh? He was famous for his paintings while living in France, not in "dark, cold" Holland. He even signed his paintings "Vincent" because the French could not pronounce his last name correctly.... . At any rate, I think the English pronounce it "Van Go" as well. The Scottish can pronounce it correctly because they have a guttural 'ch' sound as well.. . Mispronunciation is not only a matter of ignorance. How do Scots pronounce Milosevic, Mao Tse-Tung, and Li Ka-shing? I'm sure the vast majority would "mispronounce" all of these names.. . As for those names you wrote at the bottom, they are basically unknown in the US but this is how we would pronounce them:. DALL-zeel. MEN-zeez. la-MONT (much more common among Black people). . Similarly, the Irish name Caitlyn, pronounced kath-LEEN, is often pronounced KATE-lynn in the U.S., which I think sounds awful!

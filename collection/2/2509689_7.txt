Where are you getting this puppy from? If you are getting it from a so called breeder, I would not get this puppy from this breeder. not a good breeder if they are mixed to types of purebred dogs together. . If you are looking for a lab or  a retriever or a mix of both please go to www.petfinder.com. there are plenty of homeless labs and retreivers there!. . There is no real differance bettween both breeds just one has longer hair and needs more grooming.. . Good luck

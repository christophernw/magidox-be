because Atheists ask the one critical question  that you won't ..... What created god?.  When I  am  faced with two essentially absurd arguments  I choose the least absurd one.. g. Granted the idea that one day  all the basic particles of the universe that preceded the Big Bang and led to stellar evolution and all the other derivative evolutions  were simply  just  there in space is humbling, incomprehensible and absurd.. The Idea that  one day  your god  shows up in the same arena fully formed and ready to intentionally and methodically create the  universe without having evolved somewhere else first  ,is magnitudes greater in absurdity.  You cannot accept a universe that doesn't revolve around you and your need to be the reason for its' existence. The loneliness would be too much to bear .So what do you do ? You invent a god or gods and now the universe isn't such a lonely place anymore . This is totally human ,and completely  understandable.  You make one critical mistake , you start believing that it is actually true. Oops!

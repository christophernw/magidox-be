i would call your dentist or the surgeon who removed them depening on if they were under the gums still, i had mine pulled couple months ago and after a few hours after i woke up i could feel everything. i guess it all just depends on maybe what they gave u, but to be SAFE, call and ask, it definently doesnt hurt to be careful when it comes to these things. but i hope you feel better. i know it hurts like heck :)

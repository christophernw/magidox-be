THe only Christians that i know who are vegitarians dont eat meat for health reasons. My sister in law is afraid of all the bacteria thats in food (chicken has samnella, beef has e-coli, and now with the bird flu, she is afraid of that.) Also, The other vegitarian I know has high colestoral, so she doesn't eat meat. Instead, she will have a vegi burger, or something like that.

Some people get me. We humans don't have a clue how long a day is in God's life. Some say it's a thousand years and other think it's the same as our day. There are 3 earth ages in the Bible. Those 3 earth ages could very well be 3 billion years as far as we know. Why is it that everyone tries to place the same restrictions on God as are on us? God has no restrictions at all. A single day in God's life may very well be a thousand years to us.

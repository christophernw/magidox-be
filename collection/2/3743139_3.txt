yes,the solution is hypertonic which means its got more of solute particles in it and hence the water from the outside of the cell gets into the cell..  and if u are asking what the solution in the cell is called , then it is cell sap. Cell sap is a dilute fluid that is found in the large central vacuole of many plant cells. It contains water, amino acids, glucose, and salts. The sap has many functions, such as storage of useful materials, and provides mechanical support for non-woody plants; it also helps plant-cells in the process of osmosis.

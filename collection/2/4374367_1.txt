Dead, crushed bodies...several types of body oils..Virgin, Extra Virgin, 2nd pressing, etc. This is deceptively sold as Corn Oil in the super market. On occasion, you can get it free if you do not wash your hair for weeks and weeks. So, to save money on cooking oil AND water, don't take a bath or wash your hair. Is this the answer you were looking for.

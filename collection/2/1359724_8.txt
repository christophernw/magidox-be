Lust, to me, is a desperate attaction to a particular person or to a particular thing. Because of lust, you find that people have gone to the extreme to get this. They will even do the wrong things, just to get what they want. The Bible does speak against lust as being one of the fruits of the flesh, but we are told that we should put of all of the things of the old...... "behold all things have become new".

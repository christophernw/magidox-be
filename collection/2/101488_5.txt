here is something you can do. Go to a local pet store or petsmart and buy a kennel that is sized for your dog and a dog clicker. If you don't know what a dog clicker is, ask someone that works at the store and most likely they would know. go home and try petting your dog, if he growls, click the clicker, put a leash on the dog and put him in the kennel. Leave the dog alone in the kennel for about 20 minutes and than let him out. Keep doing that until he isnt aggresive.

Sex is not a way to get a guy to meet you.  It is a way to express love, not like.  Even if he does not respond to you wanting to wait, you can walk away respecting yourself and that is all that matters.  Love can come and go, but you have to live with yourself and the choices you make.  Sex is worth waiting for and you are too.

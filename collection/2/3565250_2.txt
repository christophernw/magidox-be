Happiness is not a 24/7 thing. There are bumps along the way that';s life. Happiness is knowing this and knowing that it will soon be your turn when the tides change. Happiness is loving someone unconditionally even if they don't love you back. Happiness is finding love for yourself and within yourself. Happiness is not worrying about what you don't have, but working with what you do have. Happiness is having the attitude of grattitude.

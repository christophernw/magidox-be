Talismans are sources of power, where as amulets are sources of protection. You can actually combine these, the result being called a tamulet (sometimes). But do you know what, paganism is so up in the air, with so many conflicting ideas on this and that, that I don't think anyone is going to chastise you for missing this distinction (assuming you're talking about paganism). . . As for how to concecrat them, it really depends on what you want to use your talisman/amulet for, what god or goddess you are intending to use as a focus and so on.

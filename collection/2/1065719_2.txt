You'll need a 25mm drill bit and a 1m length of rubber hose, one end of which which you put into a milk bottle.. Once you've got enough subconcious mind in the milk bottle, drink it before you go to sleep and it will be reabsorbed by a concious act, thus completing the cycle of conciousness. You can pull it out again next morning if you want to keep the cycle going.

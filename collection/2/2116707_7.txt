As a Christian, I'm sorry that people have "threatened" you with Hell. I really don't think for a second that Jesus wanted us to spread the Gospel through guilt or fear. We are just supposed to live our beliefs and be an example to those around us. That being said, if I WAS the kind of Christian who wanted to threaten someone, and I really believed what I said I believed, there really wouldn't be any point to making any threat besides hell, because there isn't anything that could be worse. We don't have anything to hide, and so there isn't any point to trying to get your questions banned, or in hacking your website. I say, bring on the debates. A good debate will put information out there for people, and someone just might find what they've been looking for.

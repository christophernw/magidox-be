A really simple answer is that a jet engine sucks in air, compresses it, injects fuel into the compressed airstream, ignites the fuel, and the burning fuel/air mixture exits the rear of the engine, creating thrust that pushes the engine (and the airplane it's attached to) down the runway into the air.. . Of course, a more detailed answer could cover several large volumes of manuals covering all the small details.

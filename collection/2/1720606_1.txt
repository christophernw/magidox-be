Streams don't erode, soil does.  However, soil erosion is affected by rate of flow, volume, and soil type (geology).. . If you are asking because it is related to a school assignment and the question is asked as you stated it, I would use the first answer and point out that it is a trick question.  Pointing out a teacher's mistakes is better than bringing an apple to class.  They really love it when you do that.. . As to the winding from the previous answer, a stream winds BECAUSE of erosion.  It does not erode because it winds.

We are animals.  We are a species of primate closely related to bonobo chimpanzees.  The thing that seems to separate us from animals are our advanced skills at manipulating our environment through the extended use of an intellectual culture. . . I have always wondered, if god created us to be separate from other animals, which is our genetic material the same as virtually every other ape.  In fact, why do apes still live in the central part of Africa where our ancestral home is located?  It makes no sense.  Evolution is clearly the better explanation for human development.

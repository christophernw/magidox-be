I am straight.. I hate it when gays feel the need to flaunt their homosexuality :"Hi ,i am John and i am gay".Think of it the other way around:Hi ,i am John and i am straight.Ridiculous ,isn't it?. I hate it when they make statements like "Da Vinci and Tchaikovsky were gay".So?Raphael and Rimsky-Corsacov were not.. In other words i hate it when they are trying hard to convince me that homosexuality is the normal and desired lifestyle.. I also hate it when straight tell me i am useless for not having or wanting to have children ,for not wanting to get married again ,for being an artist instead of holding a steady ,boring  but secure job etc.. In other words i hate it when people try to validate their lifestyle by flaunting it.. I like people who are whatever they want to be and do not ask for approval.These people have my acceptance and my friendship.. . Mac. A European

Are you one of those fascists reformed smokers?  Or someone that has never smoked and doesn't understand the addiction?. Or someone that thinks that it's not possible to smoke for 50 yrs, 2 packs a day and die of a car accident, OR never smoke, be totally healthy and die of lung cancer?. . Dude, you're gonna die...we're all gonna die...I just want to have some fun and relaxation before I go. . . And don't lecture me unless I'm blowing smoke in your face, please?

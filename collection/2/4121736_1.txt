Thank you!!!!! But it may be time for all of us to consider who is manipulating us to think this way? Approximately 2% of the world's population control in one way or another about 80+% of the world's resources. What better way to divert attention to this fact than to "spin" us into petty bickering?. . The most important struggle in the world is that between the have-almost-all-of-its v. the rest of us. If we ever get wise, I think they are badly outnumbered.. . question everything, no matter who says it. God gave us brains to use, so start using them.

One good thing about America is that we DO pull together as one people in the face of adversity.  People as a rule tend to do that.  Let's just be thankful there isn't a REASON to have to do that now!  Having visited another country before, I was never so glad to be back on American soil where this truly is the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave.  You just don't know what you have, or don't have, until you've visited the "other side of the fence."  My thanks to all those veterans who've made this possible for we Americans!

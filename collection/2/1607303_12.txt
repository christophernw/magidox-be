management and budget is important.. firstly, list down the monthly income you have, then divide it to how much u gonna spend on 4 children, food etc. and the most important thing is how much left u can save up.. try to follow it after you plan. . from time to time, try to invest on properties as you save up enough of money cause investment helps to earn u money from money. eg. u can pay loan from rental u received from tenant. once you have finished paying the loan, it could be part of your income. even if u sell the house, u could get quite a big amount of and money most of the time the price is more than you first bought it unless you invest in the wrong location and wrong time..

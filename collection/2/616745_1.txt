Sometimes "rich" is a perception. Some people simply have more because they work harder. That doesn't necessarily make them richer. The very concept of someone coming along, even a child on the playground - and taking something they have not earned, bothers some people. That mother might have had to sacrifice something to purchase that toy the other child was trying to take.. . Some "poor" people think that because they have less, those with more "owe" them something. And some people are just harda** snots with no regard for other people's feelings. I don't think a bank account has anything to do with it.

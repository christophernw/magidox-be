First, try drinking more water (not juice or pop or coffee, just water). People always think they're hungry when they're really thirsty. Second, carry around a baggie of high protein foods, like almonds. Protein takes longer to be broken down and keeps you full longer. If that doesn't work ask your doc for a hyperthyroid test. It's a simple blood test that gives you lots of answers.

Because that is what was supposed to happen as it was told in the prophecies (by Jesus, himself) and as part of His gospel; God has a plan for the world, and the crucifixion of Jesus was a part of His plan.  He gave His only son to prove His love for the world, so that we may all have eternal life.  It's all in God's plans.

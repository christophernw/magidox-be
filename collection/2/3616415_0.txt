Hi, I see everyone has answered this question but here's a literal meaning:. Reply if it pleases you.. and the "you" is the polite, proper "you" (vous) with both singular and plural meaning, not the informal singular you (tu). So it is a very very polite way to say, "Let me know if you're coming, please."

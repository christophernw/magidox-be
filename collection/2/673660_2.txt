Get insulated dog houses, put hay in them, also shredded pieces of old towels & blankets. Whole blankets will stink in no time! Never put a heat lamp in there!!! I worked for a vet & we had a huge Dobie come in with burns over 40% of his body. We almost lost him several times. As for the landlord...I crate trained my dogs & put the crates in the garage. They were not technically in the house & still warm

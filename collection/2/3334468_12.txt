Someone who does not encourage, respect, or value you as a person. They are the users, the negative ones, bad attitudes, the people you get into trouble around. They contribute nothing positive to your friendship. Why be around someone that doesn't make you feel good or puts you down, or has bad vibes. Life is too short.

Some puts me to sleep.  Church music inspires me to love god.  Classic rock, helps me do my exercises and ride my stationary bike.  Country remines me of a simplier time.. Some is violent and loud and i hate it.. Some inspires people to violence and hate.. Some singing by slaves in the south helped them cope with there bitter lives.

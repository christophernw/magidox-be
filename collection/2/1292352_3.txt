Aside from very few exceptions if your pully is turing your water pump is turning, turning is all they do.  when your car is COLD take off the radiator cap and you will see the coolant moving.  I am assuming that this is a pully operated water pump and not gear driven.  There are other reasons that your vehicle will overheat.  Thermostat, cooling fan, radiator cap, and those are just the beginning need more details for  a better answer

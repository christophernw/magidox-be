An example of being vested at my company is as follows.  For anyone who has worked here for one year, but less than two, you can only keep 20% of what the company has matched.  For those who have worked here for two years, they can keep 40% of the company match.  Three years of service equals 60% of the company match.  It takes five years of employment here to be able to take 100% of the company matching funds upon separation from the company (resignation/termination/retirement).  . . I hope that helps out.

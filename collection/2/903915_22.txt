it is because we where born into sin, because of Adam and Eve doing the wrong thing and not listening to Jehovah God. since Adam and Eve are our parents we where born into sin. we don't know what fruit Eve ate. no place in the bible does it tell us, it just tells us that it is a fruit, so we don't know if it was an apple.

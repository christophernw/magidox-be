All asians have their virtues but some are just a little more to themselves than others. Chinese appear to be more of this type, although I use to hang out with a couple of real wild chinese guys.. I've also hung out with some flipinos and they're real friendly. I guess it all depends on the circumstances and the manner that you happen to come across them.  I've hung out more with japanese than anyone else but that's because I used to work in Japan. They're pretty cool and they pretty much do and are into everything that we do out here.

Do you understand what inflation is?. After world war one, Germany was fined an enormous amount of money. To pay the fine germany had to produce more money; eventually it took wheel barrow loads of cash to buy a single loaf of bread. so the more money the U.S produces they more the value of the dollar drops.  Thats why in the fifties and sixties you could buy a candy bar for a nickel instead of 48 cents or whatever it is now.

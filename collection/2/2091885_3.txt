While we don't know all the details, failing to earn a passing grade does not mean that the professor screwed you over. When you take a course you need to be able to master the material. It isn't a matter of getting a passing grade for effort or for doing things like getting a tutor. I am afraid that many students learn in high school that you get grades for effort. Not so in college.. . So, regroup, take responsibility for your behavior, and learn from this.. . Now, a D+ isn't a failing grade, so unless you are going to be a biology major or your particular major requires it you won't have to repeat the course. Check into that first before you get bent out of shape over this.. . Best wishes for your continued education.

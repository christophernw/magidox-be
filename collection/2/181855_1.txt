In large part because of its mixed history.  It is, at base, a Germanic langauge (Anglo-saxon) which then became mixed with a Northern Germanic language (with the Viking invaders), and then with a Romance language (with the Norman invasion.)  There are dollops of other languages as well.  This melange has created a language with inconsistent rules and practices (exaggerated by the fact that some parts of the language have evolved over time more than others, and because so many different parts of the world now speak English.)

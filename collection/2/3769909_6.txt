he could very likely have pancreatitis. My dog has it and he barley eats. I am currently treating him with anti nausea meds as well as flagil. Basically his pancreas is over producing bile do to the fat in his diet. Start feeding him half hamburger meat that has virtually NO FAT and half rice. This will fill him up, give him protein, and the lack of fat will keep his pancreas from overproducing bile.... that is if he has this condition. You should get him to a vet ASAP if he can't keep food down and has such a lack of nutrients that he is loosing weight.. Fit and Trim is a good food if this is infact his problem because it is low in fat. If that is still too fatty try Royal Canin W/D.

Well, since, as stated before, darkness is the absence of light, it travels at the exact speed of light in a given medium. For example, if you turn a light on in a darkened room, it gets bright very quickly (exactly how quickly will depend on the type of light bulb or the colour of the light you use), but when you turn it off, it gets dark at the same rate. Though darkness isn't something that really "travels", what you're measuring is how fast light dissipates, which is at the speed of light!

I see it's your first question here, and if you want people to give you clear answers, then you should ask a clear question..... So let's assume this is not some mathematics question of a formula which you keep secret, but you want to use a resistor to regulate a frequency in practise. Then you need a device called a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO), like . http://www.electronics-tutorials.com/oscillators/voltage-controlled-oscillators.htm. and when you look at figure 3 then you can see how the resistors create the tuning voltage, which in turn tunes the varactors, which in turn changes the output frequency.

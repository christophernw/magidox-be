The bible was indeed given to men by God.   A couple of interesting facts.   Men even in the 1500's believed that the world was flat.  Yet, in Job, the oldest book of the bible, we read where the earth is a round sphere suspended in air and not held on to anything.  How did Job know that.  Also in Job, he talks about the bands of Pleides.  The constellation of Pleides was always thought to be one solid unit until only 100 years ago when with the most powerful telescope, they realized it consisted of a series of bands.  So, again, how did Job know that.  God put lots of little nuggets in his word for those who have the desire to find them.  There are so many examples. Also, the bible was written over 2000 years by 50 different authors in different lifetimes and yet they all have the same theme all the way through.   Even the dead sea scrolls show that except for a few small words like "the" etc, the bible we have today basically the same as when originally written.  This may be more information than you need to know but.   As to Homosexuals, the bible says that no homosexual or effeminate will be in the kingdom of heaven.  That's good enough for me.  The homosexual does not recognize God's plan for the human race but as it says in Romans 1, they decided to go their own way and pervert God's plan by men turning to men and women to women.  It is condemned in the old testament and the new testament.

English wasn't the first, second, or even the third language that was spoken in this country.. However, it is the main language spoken in this country today.  I do think that people should learn at least the basics before coming here ...  But I think Americans need to do the same when they go to other countries.  Sure, a lot do ...  But there are so many who don't and expect everyone in the World to speak English.. . You also have to look at the people who belittle countries like Cuba and Socialist Latin American countries and send out the message that the US welcomes the citizens of aforementioned countries.. . As for someone who complained about their children having to learn another language in school ...  Is that really such a bad thing?  Learning another language also helps children with their own grammar and even math classes.  Is being smart really that frowned upon?. . And did I really just read that our ancestors came here and the English language is was bound them together as Americans?  That gave me the greatest laugh I've had all day.  My great grandparents spoke only French and Italian was spoken on the other side of the family.  Just about everyone in their communites didn't speak a lick of English, either.. And when it comes to "One Nation Under God" ...  She might want to actually learn a little bit about the founding fathers.. http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050221/allen

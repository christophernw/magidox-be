The best thing i ever used was caladryl and taking a luke warm bath in aveeno you know the oatmeal medication in the packetsI think you get 8 packs in a box.You can also get that caladryl in clear so it dosen't show on your skin.Hope this helps try the caladryl in the day time and the aveeno at night.You may have to use caladryl after your bath if the rash is real bad.

I am not picking on you here..but do you lead by example..if you say no..then pick up your end and let the employees see that you do your end of your work... if you said yes...maybe do a little more... OK. if you treat them as friends and joke around..maybe this NEEDS to stop..even if they are your friends..tell them friends outside of work..but in work I AM YOUR BOSS ! ! period... so you should know by now..staying calm and being honest and truthful ( so nothing comes back on you at all ). you talk to them in the privacy of your office..and you make the whole conversation stay on a nice calm level..if ti starts to get a little out of hand..take a deep breathe and bring back down to a nice calm manner... and talk it out..NO not like talking to your child or wife.... but in the context of your work... and if the person gets to much out of hand tell them they just may have to go home for the remainder of the day with out pay ( if that is allowed where you work..if it is not bring it up at your next managers meeting to get it allowed..this makes people mad..but works wonders ..). if all else fails..( even if it is a friend ) you must fire them and ask them to pack up and leave NOW.. if the do not leave, just walk away and call the police... Good Luck

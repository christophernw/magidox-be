God said that if you ask for forgiveness and you really are sorry for what you did,and accept God in your life that you are forgiven,but if you don't have any remorse are care about what you did you WILL go to Hell.I really wish for your own sake that you have a conscience and you listen to it because to most people that's God speaking to us and we all should listen to it more often and maybe this little stop over we have here on earth would be a better place before we go to our real home in HEAVEN.LET ME TELL YOU WHEN YOU FIND GOD AND PUT HIM FIRST IN YOUR LIFE YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE IS A WHOLE NEW WORLD OUT THERE.I PROMISE YOU,YOU WON'T BE THE SAME PERSON YOU ARE NOW,YOU WILL FIND HAPPINESS.

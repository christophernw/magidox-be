could you be more specific? i dont know what you mean by hating christmas. what have they done to abolish christmas? please be specific.. . i went to a catholic school, and had to do a lot of studying as to what the REAL meaning of christmas is, and let me tell you most of what you see out there has nothing to do with it. BUT, its still a nice time of year and i hold no grudge towards frosty the snowman and santa claus. hopefully we can all smile and laugh this season with our families.. . also, i grew up around ppl of other religions, and to be honest, i didnt always remember who believed in what, so i got really used to saying "happy holidays" just because it was plain easier that way. and even if you dont care about the faith that others believe in, New Years comes right after christmas, thats 2 holidays.... PLURAL, so "happy holidays" isnt anti christmas, its just easier to say.. . and really, if your tax dollars were spent on decorating the town hall during ramadan, or were used to build a statue of ganesh, i bet you'd be pissed.

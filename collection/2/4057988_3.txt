Every race has their own culture...Hispanics do it...Indians do it...Arabs...we all have a tendency to feel more secure in our own group. Different styles of speaking, dress, manners...but that doesn't mean we should not try to understand one another. I love Destiny's Child, I think Ludracis is funny, and I like soul food--and I'm a white male! So respect their space and at the same time, don't feel like they are pushing you out...it really is a cultural thing.....

Men are leaders and providers. Often though we act on things without thinking it completely through. Women are our help meet and make us complete. Women are more emotional (Most of the time). Women are keepers of the home. This is not a bad thing or something to be looked down upon. Rather women who keep the home should be praised for what they do becausethey work harder then their husbands do and usually get little or no thanks. Women see things from a different perspective, which us men desperately need. Guys you better thank your wife for all she does for you.

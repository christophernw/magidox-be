Well look at the already obvious evidence; how does he feel that you are his friend and he knows that you are gay?  Has he ever made remarks about your sexuality? And are you open because if you are usually that will determine how they would react to the subject? . . I always use this analogy and its possible that you could use it as well... If you do tell him that you like him, let him know that the "ball is in his court." Everything is his decision.... He might reject you, and regardless of his reasons you should respect his decision.... . . Last piece of advice take everything for face value. Do not try and take deeper meanings out of actions or comments, when sexuality is involved because it could make you feel worse...

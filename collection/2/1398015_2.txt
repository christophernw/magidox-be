On an online rhyming dictionary, the only returns are "calve", "halve", "have", and "nav".  Doesn't sound like a whole lot of choices for you, but I guess it depends on your creativity.  Usually unscramble.net has really good returns on words, generally from 1 syllable to 3, so if you need any other rhyming words for the rest of your poem, be sure to check it out.  I hope it helps~

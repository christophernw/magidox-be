It is easy for one to forgive because that is our true nature, although some are hardened to the point where their true nature has been encapsulated by their hardness and ignorance.  . To forget on the other hand is hard because our consciousness seems to be the sum of our experiences and we canâ€™t just erase a section of our past as we may like to, in an attempt to move on.  Time can make even the most painful memories distant instead of front and center, but to not have any memory would open the door to repeating the mistake that occasioned the pain.

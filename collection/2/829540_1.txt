Lieberman is now an independant, but he will vote democrat on most issues.. . i disagree with liebermans stances on most things, but respect him as a man of integrity.. . Votes are what matters, not what party people are in.  Although, unfortunately, usually what party you are in, will determine how you vote on most things.

That's quite a question. Actually, I do think some people do choose to be mentally ill. Or, in reality, they fake a mental illness to escape life, even to get to be in an institution for treatment of mental illness. But that is very unusual. Most of us who are mentally ill would not choose to be for anything in the world. It can be the worst agony that you can imagine. I hope you don't think what you said is true, because you are far from the mark. No one would choose the life that the mentally ill lead.

take fredcdobbs answer.  That is best answer.  It would be a very rare occasion that someone would run line with only 2 conductors in it.  Now if the cable is Cat5, the colors will not be red, green, yellow, black.  They will be blue/white and orange/white.  But same principle applies.  You would connect the orange/white pair to the module in Network interface for the second line as well as the jacks where you want that line to appear.

Find out what time mass is, and go sit and observe one. (You probably shouldn't take any bread & wine the first time around, some have specific rules about it.). . After the mass is over, go up to anyone who participated (the priest, a reader, etc) and ask them how you can join up.  They hardly ever say no!  :-)

Meditation may help you.  It will help you release stress, deal with the things that have stressed you out, and help you find you center in general.  It's mostly a way of thinking.  I don't believe in getting nervous or anxious.  I just gave it up.  Instead of thinking about the negative side (OMG what if I fall in front of everyone?), think about the opportunities (if I fall in front of everyone, surely I will meet some new people in the process).  Yoga might also help.. . Try a guided meditation CD.  They may seem hokey, but if you look past that, they can really help you relax.

On a resume most people only list their 'professional' (IE: corporate) jobs.  If you just received your degree, then apply for new grad jobs and avoid the exotic dancer info on your resume.  . . Now that I think about it...It may help you to have it on there!  That would be hot if some woman had that on her resume!

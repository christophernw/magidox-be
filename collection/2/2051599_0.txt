go to you local hardware store, buy a bag of cement.... and  a pallette of bricks. build a small wall then break a bottle... Viola! instant installation art of 99 bottles of beer on a wall. of course because you are the artist you dont actually have to fill them with beer. just by stating they they are bottles of beer will not make it less so.. ( its a bit like that artist who made a piece with a glass of water and claimed it was an oak tree)

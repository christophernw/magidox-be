Sounds like you're pretty judgmental of your loved ones. Saying that someone has done something "stupid" is way less than charitable. After all, we all make mistakes..."to err is human". . . Perhaps it will help you to think of that when you or anyone around you does something wrong. Perfectionism is a sure-fire road to unhappiness for the perfectionist. That person will always be disappointed with himself and others, and actually drive them away. . . And besides, really, should you be judging others?

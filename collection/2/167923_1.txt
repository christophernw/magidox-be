that depends on wether the injector is from a diesel or a gasoline engine if it is from a gas engine you can probaly run down to your local parts store and they will have an addative in a little botttle that you pour into yopur gas and it will clean the injectors as you drive.(if you ask for injector cleaner the store can probaly help you find it)

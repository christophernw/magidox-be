The 1960's seem like forever ago. Those of us who weren't even born then have a hard time imagining it, but the truth is racism is still alive and well. I think we can all agree.. . Today the average CEO is in his late 50's. So that means he was growing up during those still very racist times. There was a study a year or so ago that showed most of a person's beliefs are in place by time they are seven or eight. . . Maybe they aren't racist overtly. Maybe it's subconscious. But there is racism in the work place.. . Affirmative Action isn't great...in fact it sucks pretty hard...but what is the alternative. Should we just wait while minorities slide further behind. We have to try something, and in less you have a better idea just deal with it...many great Americans had to do it for hundreds of years.

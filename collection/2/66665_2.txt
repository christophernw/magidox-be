Usually your information was sold to an affiliate without your knowledge in these cases. My bank is pretty bad with this. Until you find the root offender you will keep getting different offers. You stop one and another takes its place. Take a look at the people you do business with and research whether or not you can get taken off any 3rd party affiliate lists. Whatever credit cards you have now is a good place to start then try any lenders you deal with. Outside of that you can take out your frustration out by using thier prepaid envelopes to send back the crap or a note expressing your anger. Good Luck !

I have always wondered this!  I am aware that there are international stars in Hollywood - this isn't the point (and of course James Bond has an English accent - as he's supposed to be English it'd be pretty funny if he didn't.  Although, lots of bond actors aren't even English.  Pearce Brosnan is Irish and we all know Sean Connery is Scottish - note for Americans - it's not 'scotch' it's 'scottish'.  Scotch is a drink.).. . English accents are the 'bad guy' accent of choice at the moment it seems.  I think this is because Hollywood doesn't want to upset anyone by ever even intimating that an American could be a bad guy (so no baddie Americans, then) and it's not exactly politically correct to use the traditional German or Russian accent, so it's our turn to be the baddie, I guess!

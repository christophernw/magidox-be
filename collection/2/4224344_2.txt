Your arguments are not cogent: even if you assume as a given that the brain and mind are the same, it does not follow that everything is causally connected to the brain/mind.. It is not correct to assume that the thoughts or ideas that form in your brain are seeded by physical events.  It is well-established that order can be imposed externally (that is, a result can be predictable) even from a "system", such as the brain, which at some level of decomposition can be conceived as a system of "chaotic" elements.

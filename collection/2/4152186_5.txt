Without a driver, I am hoping? Right? Well the answer to that would be a counter weight mounted on the stearing wheel, that would reach one side of a measured distance or turn, and would use the kinetic energy of the car to shift the weight back and forth from each side, causing the car to turn in different directions at the appropriate time. Another theory would be a belt/pulley configuration powered by an internal motor, that would pull on belts to turn the wheel when set on a correct program.

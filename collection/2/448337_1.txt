I think you mean, "Why don't rotten eggs sink?". . There's more gas in it because the thing inside decayed, meaning it gives of gas and becomes smaller in size. But since it is inside the egg, there is no way out for the gas, so it stays inside the egg and makes the egg float when placed in water, just like a balloon filled with air.

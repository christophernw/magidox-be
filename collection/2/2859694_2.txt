Depends on the type - if its early onset diabetes that comes on below the age of 20 (now known as Type 1 diabetes) its believed that its an autoimmune disease - the body knocks out the islet cells in the pancreas that produce insulin.. The other type is type 2 (used to be called late onset or mature onset). This occurs when the body develops a resistance to the insulin it produces. There are several causes but the main one is obesity. Biochemically the extra fat cells cause insulin resistance which can build up to the point that the insulin has no effect and it is similar to having produced none in the first place

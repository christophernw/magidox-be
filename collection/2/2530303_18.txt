Lets say your 12 year old daughter was raped. She didnt even know what sex was. But she got pregnant. You have 3 options....make your 12 year old go through the humilation of being at school pregnant at 12, Make her have it and give it up for adoption which she still has that humiliation and its not fair for her.... either way she is always gonna have the horrible expeirence of being at school, or she is going to have to leave at age 12.....raise a baby at age 12 that was concieved by violence and a constantly have a horrible memory... or give it to someone else and still have that pain...... Abortion is ok in some circumstances.

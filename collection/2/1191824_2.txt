One democrat wants to bring the draft back, but in a unique way. He wants to ensure that the draft is truly equal. It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor, you would have to go (with an exception of college students).. . In effect, he wants those that support wars like Iraq to put their money where their mouth is (or in this case, their children in the line of fire). His line of thinking is that if the president's children were forced to go to war (along with those of the congress-critters), then they would not go to war unless it was a really really good reason backed by solid evidence. This would help prevent debacles like Iraq from occuring in the future.. . A nice political gimmick, but it won't amount to anything. He doesn't have the support of his own party, let alone support from the republicans.. . ~X~

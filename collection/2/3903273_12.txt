There are many, but I think I would most like to talk with Daniel, about how he felt about and what he thought of the visions he had concerning the march of world powers.. . Although I will not be able to meet Peter, since he will be in heaven while I'm here, if I had the opportunity to do so I would like to talk to him. He reminds me a lot of my self.

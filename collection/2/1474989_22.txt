I'm sorry for being bold on this:. God did not take your friend's life, heroin did.  God did not use your friend as an example, we make choices, and some choices have consequnces.  God is wise, I believe He would not allow your friend to do this if she sought counsel from the Almighty God.  Like many people in some of these answer forums, they don't believe in God.  That is their choice.  This may have consequences in the future.... God is not to blame.

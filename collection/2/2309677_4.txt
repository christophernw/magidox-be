Those are hard to get rid of ... I personally believe it's because there is no good way to truly work that area as with other areas of the body ... I did get rid of mine by adding a natural and healthy weight loss plan to my daily routine. I didn't change anything that I was all ready doing, I just added this to my routine and the results have been great. 27 pounds lost and 3" lost in my waist (including the handles) in just over 40 days. Best of luck to you in finding the answers and in keeping your health

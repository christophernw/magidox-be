I am not sure what you mean by using.  If it is going into it to sleep or explore, the answer is to close the door.. . If it is the cat peeing/pooping in your room and not the litter box, then I would suggest several items.  Is this more than once?  Are they spayed/neutered?  (If not, they should be).. . First, have him/her checked by a vet. You will want to rule out any physical problems such as a UTI or other issues. Is he neutered? (If not, that raises a different series of physical causes).. . Second, you need to remove 100% of the odor from the area he urinated. Just because you can't smell it doesn't mean they can't! Pets stores sell special cleaners such as natures miracle to help with this.. . Assuming it is physical, address that issue with your vet.. . If it is not physical, ask yourself has anything changed? . . Did you move the litter boxes? Did you change the brand of litter? Are the litter boxes still in a fairly attractive area for the cat(and well away from their food/water)? Does the cat feel safe?  (I have heard all sorts of stories about this -- people not figuring out that: leaving the boxes in the basement with no lights at all; placing a dog crate next to the cat box; putting the cat box next to the cat food, etc. are all bad ideas). . . Have you added any new people or pets to the household? Have you changed your routine a great deal. Put simply, cats hate change!. . You also might want to restrict access to that room except when you are present. That can help prevent the problem -- and would help determine the cause.. . I also like the Feliway pheromone spray if the cat seems to be marking their territory.

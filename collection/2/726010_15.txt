Why do we park in the driveway and drive on the parkway?. It's just one of those things that shouldn't be thought of to often. Just go with the flow. :). Personally, when nature calls, I politely excuse myself to the ladies room. That's when I'm in public. Hasn't it also been called the water closet?

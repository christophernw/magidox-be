could be lots of things, the car will need to be scanned and pull the code From the computer, the code will point you in the right direction to correct the problem...note take it to a qualified mechanic that knows what they doing..DON"T let a discount auto part store(AUTO ZONE) fool with your car...they don't work on cars and cause more damage them good..I do this for a living...don';t get worried until you get the results it's not always something major..good luck

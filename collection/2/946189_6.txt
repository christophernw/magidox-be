When you use a calling card you have to dial an access number first (well most of the calling cards I know work that way), so if you call your friend by using a calling card it won´t show her your phone number because it is like if you were calling from a different phone number. I don´t know if this might work, but you can give it a try, you can tell your friend to store into her cell phone the access number you usually use to place the phone calls as if that was your phone number, MAYBE (not sure), next time you call her by using a calling card your name will show up.

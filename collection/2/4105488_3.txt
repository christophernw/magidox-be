Blueprints are copies of the original drafted plans to build something. The original process for copying made a sheet with a blue background (for the white part of the original) and white for the black lines. It was thought this arrangement would hold up better to fading. Later, the copies made were more like the original, white background and blue lines. Now, very few people still use this process, with a Xerox like process being now the predominate copying mode. The name for these copies has not changed though.

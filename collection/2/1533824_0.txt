A couple of reasons... Gold atoms are heavier than either the iron or sulfur atoms that make up pyrite.  Also when the iron and sulfur atoms bond in pyrite they form a lattice or patterned arrangement.  This leaves room for lots or air in between the atoms.  Gold bonds to other gold atoms in a very close arrangement, as close as possible, leaving little space for air.

Ha.  It's not much help but.... . In a bad, drugged out area of my city the only place with public restrooms is a huge bookstore.  If you go into these stalls you'll see it: old blood stains all over the stall walls.  . . It's heavy spatter, going up and away in all directions from the person who was presumably sitting on the toilet.  . . The walls are stainless steel but still they can't scrub all of it off.. . Very blanking gross!

encronologist doesnt seem to be a word in the dictionary. I tried looking it up, which you can do too you silly person. (smile) Now I suggest you contact your dr. and ask for a spelling of the word and maybe have the doc tell you just what it is. Hmmmmmm, sounds pretty simple from where I sit...(smile)

Tin is best known for its use in the manufacture of tin cans. It is most commonly seen as the outer layer on tin-plate or tin cans. It does not tarnish in the air, and protects iron only by excluding oxygen from the iron. This is in contrast to galvanizing where the protection by zinc is due to its higher activity than iron. Since tin is an expensive metal and tin is usually recovered from scrap tin-plate. . . So the tin in tin cans is there to make the cans NOT rust.  If you scratch the tin, or remove it, then the metal underneath being protected would rust, and as others have suggested, exposure to salt water and air will hasten the rusting.

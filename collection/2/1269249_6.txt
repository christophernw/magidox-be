He has a purpose and a plan for your life. He is a healer. If you let Him, He will come in and heal you everywhere you hurt. Nothing is too hard for God. He created your body. He will give you total restoration. You need to go to church, read   your Bible and trust in Jesus as your Lord. The Bible says, "The enemy comes to steal, kill and destroy but I have come that you might have life and life more abundantly. Please try what I tell you. What have you got to lose? god will never give you more than you can bare. I will be praying for you and believing God for you healing. God bless!

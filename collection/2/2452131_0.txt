I think that the aforementioned university lecture was trying to put across a point about types of electrical loads. If you were to connect a great big capacitor across the live and neutral wires (DON'T TRY IT!!), you can put a heavy load on the supply, but the power consumption registered on the meter will be zero.. . Why? Because when you apply a mains voltage signal to a capacitor, current and voltage are exactly 90 degrees out of phase, and so the power factor (cosine of 90 degrees) is zero - a purely reactive load. Most appliances have to be designed to have a power factor as close to 1 as possible (purely resistive load), so that the electricity suppliers don't get irate.

Dumbledore is not dead at all.I hav a proof . When Malfoy came and used "Expelliarmus" Charm Dumbledore made Harry Potter still for some time.. The point is why didn't he made Malfoy still insted Harry.There must be some plan between Albus and Snape that's why Dumbledore asked many questions to Malfoy to make sure that Snape is coming to kill him or not..........................

its a good thing that you worded the second part of your question with the word "most" (why do most Christians). . anyway, you have to "prove" to me first that you have proven "some" Christians wrong.. . & you can probably use some critical thinking.... . back to the question though, . why do most Christians get mad... because they are h-u-m-a-n,. just like  you.

I suggest that you remove yourself from the equation. . . I have been instructing Chinese Kung-Fu for many years to ages 5 upward and often I have found that the dicipline that I instill in the children is one that the parents are unable to as I have them in a place where I can channel their attention into something creative under strict diciplinarian rules whilst allowing them to have fun.. . Giving a child a arena like this allows a third party to enforce dicipline and channel their energy in a place where they have no power. Often Children have a power over the parents : parents care for their child and kids use this subconsciously to leverage their demands and desires.. . Kids also often have loads of excess energy that they don't do anythng with-especially since so many just play nintendo/playstation all day. That energy makes them arguementative and unruely unless correctly channeled cia physical activity - especially physical activity that is toward an end.. . I suggest a good Kung-Fu teacher who is both diciplined and knows how to deal wtih kids. Things to look for : 1. a class that is kids ages 5-11. Don't let the kids go to a class with adults. They feel alienated and are best with kids their own age and a bit above; 2. a teacher who has experience teaching children; 3. someone sincere who can teach kids without using an iron fist all the time. The best teachers are ones that get the kids to do what he/she wants by making them want to do it.. . Just a thought.

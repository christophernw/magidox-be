Newfoundland (CA).......and there were too few and probably mixed with the local (aborigene) population.. . And it is a myth that they wore helmets with horns..:-). . www.pitt.edu/~dash/vinland.html. . edit; it was for tourist purposes airplanegirl of course (laugh)..they needed the people to come..!! Seriously, Greenland WAS green at the time but the tide changed after that and ....the Vikings there did not get help from mainlaind Europoe, very possibly fought with the inuits and just died of starvatio, fights etc and lack of supplies.

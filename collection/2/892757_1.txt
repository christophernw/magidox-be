hmm.. i dont see is a problem. . . for example, i bought a freehold property in msia, i own the land but the land is not mine, it is belong to msia government.. . . same thing as per KTM land, they own it but they still bound to the spore law, isn't it? so what is the problem? the land is yours, the singaporean!. . well, this is my personal opinion. i cant recall when is the topic of the KTM in spore land, only left some rough memory. i just felt the KTM want to made some issues. as we all know, msia and spore relationship is very sensitive.. . as a msian, i just hope the railway will improve the friendship of msian & sporean :>

Just stand up for yourself and ask her for some personal space , or when she asks you a personal question just inform her that it is personal and you'd feel better if she didn't know or ask anymore personal questions.. . I had to associate with this one girl before who was the same way. I would have felt bad if I said anything but something had to be done. . . Trust me, you'll feel better if you just stand up for yourself and do it.

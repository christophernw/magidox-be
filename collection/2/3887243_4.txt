"A thousand years in god's eyes, is as an evening gone by" simply means that God ages differently from mankind. . . Which begs the question does God age/can or will he grow old?. God is ancient but can't grow old.. "God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.". . About creation, it took six (6) days (man's time), not seven.

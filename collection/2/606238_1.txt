I get rid of Indigestion either by taking baking soda and water mixture or by taking some Pepto-Bismal. According to some science experiments that were done at a science class that I attended the baking soda/water mixture was found to be the best at counteracting stomach acid. But from experience works but tastes gross. Pepto-Bismal doesn't taste as bad and I have found works because it soothes the stomach.

They're talking about an 8 ounce glass for a total of 64 ounces.  A lot of dietitians and doctors are now saying that is a myth.  Come to think of it, nothing that feels forced can be realistically necessary for you.  And don't forget, a lot of fruits and vegetables are mostly composed of water, not to menyion any juices you drink.  So I tend to thi nk that four or five glasses are enough, and if it's hot, or you worked out, you'll feel it if you need more.

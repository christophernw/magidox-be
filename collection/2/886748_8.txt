iono that's a good question. I'm black and my best, most coolest Friend was white.   I think, in general though, neither side can fully understand one another.  their are alot of ignorant assumptions, and stupid things that people base their perception off of, i guess that's called racism.  everybody is going to have their own opinion to this though.

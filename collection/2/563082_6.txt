we are the creation of our own destiny. As per Hindu sacred religion, we carry all good and bad deeds life after life. There is no end unless we pray for unification of self with the divineliness.. Hence there is always a possible way to complete mergence with God in this life by a simple and wonderful meditation. . This is the reason why people believe in God. . Thanks

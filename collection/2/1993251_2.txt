I believe a TRIAL is something that comes from outside us.  An unexpected job loss, a disease, persecution for our witness of Jesus Christ.. . James 1:2-3 (NKJV)  . My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, 3knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. . . I believe a TEMPTATION comes from within us.  I see something and my desires want me to have it, even if it means sinning to get it.. . 2 Peter 2:9-10 (NKJV)  . then the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment, 10and especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. They are presumptuous, self-willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries, . . James 1:12-14 (NKJV)  . Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. 13Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. 14But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed.

Partisan means connected with or controlled by a party. The party in power will appoint the chairman slot and a majority of the votes to party members in a partisan committee. The 9-11 commission was non-partisan in that it was not controlled by the party in power. Members of both Dem and GOP were on it, with no party controlling procedures or outcome. To be sure, many of the members had political agendas to carry out. But the commission itself was given independence and free reign to investigate the evidence without answering to anyone in their respective parties. Many of them were retired from politics so they weren't beholden to party bosses in smoke filled rooms.

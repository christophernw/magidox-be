Have you ever driven a Mercedes? That is one car well worth the $$. Maybe the people that buy them don't plan on trading them in, or are financially above our train of thought when it comes to buying cars. if I had $100,000 and it had to be spent on a Car, I'd buy a Mercedes, and through the rest in the bank. The car is incredible. Classy and elegant, but still a eye catcher for all ages. Nobody wants to race you, they just look at the car and admire.

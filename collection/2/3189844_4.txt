I don't see them in the same catagory b/c ATMs are for cash and deposits. I stopped needing cash as soon as I could use my debit card everywhere. I still make deposits on occation. E-banking is great because I can check my balance and make transfers.  I have stopped writing paper checks which I think is great.  I just don't get your question.  Of course E-banking will have a bigger effect than ATMs.  ATMs where only there for convience after hours. Online banking has a ton more features and as baby boomers start to retire I think more and more people will rely on online banking more than calling the bank or writing paper checks.

There was a Church of England, I'm not sure if it was necessarily Catholic or Lutheran, but it was a state Church. The people who left wanted to serve God in their own ways. Jesus Freaks by dc Talk mentions some of these early Christians. That is primarily why the Americans wanted freedom of religion when they formed our country.

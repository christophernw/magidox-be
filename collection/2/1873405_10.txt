I blame both.... . The system for not enforcing the laws, securing the border and having reasonable immigration laws to deal the labor demand.  I blame the Mexican (and other) goverments for making conditions in their country bad enough that people feel they need to enter the US illegally just to survive or make a decent living.. . I blame the illegals since they are breaking the law.  . I blame companies of all sizes who hire illegals.

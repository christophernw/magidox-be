Mystery girl has the right info, but you dont want to think of "how a glacier forms" and relate it to a river.. . Glacial ice is very different from ice in a lake or in your freezer.  Lake ice or ice cubes are made directly by freezing water.  Glacial ice is made when snow is compacted.. . A good example of how a glacier forms is:  valleys at high elevations in the mountains stay cold year round.  Snow accumulates in these valleys, or depressions.  If all of the snow does not melt during the summer, it becomes compacted.  As more and more snow fills in and doesnt melt, you get a deep pile of snow.  The bottom layers of snow compact even more, and turn into ice (see mystery girls description of how snow turns to corn snow to firn, to ice).  Once that mass of snow and ice starts to flow under its own weight (note that when I say "flow", it is flowing at a rate that is imperceptible to people--maybe inches a year at first!), it is technically a glacier.. . Glaciers are not "cubes" and they are not "left over from the ice age."

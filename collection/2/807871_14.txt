You can't disprove faith... that's why it's faith.... and if you don't believe in Christ or his teachings, why are you trying to hold others to a higher standard than you have for yourself?  It's not a Christians place to judge... that will be Christ's job when he comes again... we're to show compassion...  I don't judge you because you're a non-believer.... . To seriously answer your question though... I think we Christians, and the Christian church as a whole does a poor job of teaching our members how to debate non-believers, so some people get frustrated when they don't have an answer to all of your questions... combine that with the fact that a huge % of people who claim to be Christian don't actually attend church, and you have a large portion of the "Christian" population that is not prepared to wage a serious argument for their own faith...  and that is frustrating.

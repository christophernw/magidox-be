Your own inner strength will protect you from black magic. It seems very powerful, but is in fact quite weak. That is why people who do not believe in black magic are rarely affected by it in the same way. Don't worry about if someone is doing black magic on you. It is unimportant, and will only make you stressed and paranoid. If you are really worried, pray to God each morning to protect you, and thank God each night. You will find you are completely protected.

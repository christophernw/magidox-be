An airplane flies due to the aerodynamic reactions that happen when air passes at high speed over the wing.. . If you look at a cross-section of an airplane wing, you will see that the top of the wing is curved, while the bottom of the wing is straight -- or at least curved less than the top. This shape -- called an airfoil -- is what creates lift when a wing travels through the air.

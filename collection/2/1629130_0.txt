ok, guys.  both v_dawg and quicksilver are right.  when water makes a phase transition from liquid to solid (freezing) it expands in volume; that's why bottles filled with liquid will crack in the freezer.. . on the other hand, if you leave it sitting there for a while, there will be a slow phase transition from solid to gas (sublimation) and over weeks-months the ice cubes will noticeably shrink in size.

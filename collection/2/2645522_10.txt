There is nothing that says we will not have trials or troubles in our lives. . Basically it boils down to an adult making the decision to do something to a child that is smaller and weaker than them. . Is it a christian action- NO but is it the fault of Jesus- NO it is the fault of the person doing the molesting. .  . We need to quit blaming GOD for what people do.

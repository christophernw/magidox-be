climate,genetics. well if ur a seasoned traveller, u'll c that each asian population is slightly different. asians hav basically 3 big families;Chinese,Malay n Indian,each with different facial features,skin tone,slight differences in hair colour. Honestly,people from Japan,Korea,Taiwan,HongKong,. Cambodia,Myanmar,Laos etc came frm e Chinese family tree..people frm Malaysia,Indonesia,Brunei. r frm e Malay family tree n people frm India,Sri Lanka,Bangladesh,Pakistan etc..r frm e Indian family tree. y we hav different languages is cause we've all moved out n settled in e different places n created our own languages. so technically asians r more varied in terms of look n like i said if ur a seasoned traveller u'll notice it. im asian but i hav brown hair n eyes n fair skin. i dont hav any European blood although i do speak french n english..but here in France i've been mistaken for a South American..but i dont speak spanish..haha..voila!!

You need to find what the List price to sale price ratio is in the area and make an offer accordingly.. . You may even want to narrow it down on list to sale price ratio on similar properties.. . In our area it is common to make 90% offers as list to sale ratio is about 93%.. . If the numbers were the same in your area a $63,000 would be my suggestion.

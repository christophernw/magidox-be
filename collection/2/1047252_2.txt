Seems to me that you have never lived in, nor visited the "South". I find no more people of lesser intelligence here in North Carolina than I do anywhere else! And while we are on this topic, riddle me this; why do so many "Northerners" migrate south for retirement and/or relocation? Could it be that it's a better climate? Better schools? Maybe even, dare I say it?, that people in the south actaully have MANNERS! It's narrow-mided questions like this that cause ALL our I.Q. levels to shrink! Seems to me that Larry the Cable Guy isn't so dumb after all. He's got a LOT more money than you!

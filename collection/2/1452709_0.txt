I think it is because everyone is sure that he or she is a true philosophical genius and is either able to answer any "philosophical question" or to prove that it has no meaning or no solution.. .  One of my favourite stories which is also applicable to the studying of philosophy: if someone says that he is the world champion in chess many would like to play with him, but if he is a box champion, no one would want to fight.

Just tell your mum straight out - you can't hide it for long anyway, and it's a lot more comfortable when you have proper sanitary towels and things. If you're too embarrassed to tell your mum (although there's no reason why you should be, it's a totally natural thing), then maybe leave a note on her bed telling her that you've started and you need some sanitary towels. Good luck.

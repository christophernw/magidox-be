Tell them everything.  If they find out during a background search, they'll yank you out of week 8 of boot camp and send you home.  Happened to a few of my buddies on Parris Island.  Tell your recruiter first, as he'll be able to tell you what NOT to worry about.  Then they'll ask at MEPS, then they'll ask again when you get to basic.  anything that comes up after that is not good in the eyes of the Gov't.

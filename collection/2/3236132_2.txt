first the bible prophets ended with Jesus the fulfilment-of those that use the bible and put it into context of the day-its fine-to those like Jean Dixon with a high rate of prophecy yet over 10% error-the bible says in Deuteronomhy 17:17 predicting Jesus-if he told one thing that didnt come to pass he was to be stoned to death "A prophet shall come like unto Moses, hear ye him." in amazing grace with thanks

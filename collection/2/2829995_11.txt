There is just one right answer to your question. Its our political system and thats why its happenning. Muslims are minority in India. Most of the people dont see them as any different and they are not. Its the politics, the leaders know that if they want to rule this country, there are certain things they cant let go off. Something like Kashmir. Same is the case with Muslim minority. If something happens to them, they dont vote for the people involved. So such things become well publicized. I know that its a sorry state of affairs here. But its upto the people. People like you and I to make sure that we stay united. After all think about it this way. In our day to day lives, do we really care whether the person standing next to us is a Hindu or a muslim. NO. Because it doesnt matter...

I'm not sure, but given your rather colorful questions I'd say you have a sense of humor.  I'm certain your sermons are interesting, just a little too long.  Cut it back by 15 minutes and watch em' smile like kids who just snuck a cookie.  ;). . Incidentally-  your other questions and answers are quite.....interesting.

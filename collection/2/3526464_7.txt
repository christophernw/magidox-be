tefal and esol schools run free lessons when they are teacher training .in g.b schools are going to teachin g reading through synthetic phonics. of course there are night schools and an excellent 'gremlins' advertising campaign to take the shame out out of adult difficulty with reading which is widespread due to liberal teaching methods in the last thirty years. you should also find out if you have an underlying difficulty such as dyslexia which has certain forms where you can't see the page properly in the first place,or dystaxia. learning with a friend is liable to discourage you as it is a specialist teaching subject. dont be ashamed to ask for help its not your fault

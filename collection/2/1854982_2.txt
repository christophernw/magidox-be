With a 'stone', stones are totally cool and when used properly can destroy anything, which is also totally cool.. . Vanity: Excessive pride in one's appearance or accomplishments; conceit. . . All we need to do is create a society where everyone is the same, equal in all ways including identical personalities, appearance and behaviour.. Once this is achieved, by definition 'vanity' could not exist as there would be nothing to be vain about.. Would make for a rather dull world though.

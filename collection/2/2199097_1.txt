Because it is the nature of the beast.  Many states, like California, have attempted to shorten the process by mandating a "fast track" policy.  In theory, a case should be disposed of within one year of filing.  . . In practice, this is not practical.  When you file a lawsuit, you must first serve all defendants.  Drafting, filing and serving a complaint can take up to 30 days.  The defendants then have 30 days to answer.  If they file a demurrer or motion to strike, that delays everything by an additional 30 to 45 days.  Then, you have to conduct discovery (the process of gathering information for your case.)  That takes a minimum of 6 months.  From there, assuming everything goes to plan, you get put on the trial setting calendar.  But before you can go to trial, the court will force you into a settlement conference at least 30 days before trial.  If the case doesn't settle, you go to court and hope you get a trial date.  If the court's docket is full, you'll get kicked over for 30 to 45 days and wait for the next round on the trial calendar.  In some counties (Placer County, CA) it can take up to two years just to get a courtroom for trial.  That means that a case in Placer County will take 3 or more years to litigate.. . This is the best-case scenario.  Worst case scenario is where you have a complex case with many defendants and many legal issues.  Or, God forbid, an opposing counsel who wants to file every motion s/he thinks of.  With that kind of person, you can add at least one more year to the process.. . Bottom line -- litigation really, truly sucks.  Unless, of course, you're a lawyer.  Then it's fun.

stick with the slow walking and keep your heart rate down at least your still moving and doing what you want. I'm 50 I still run, ha ha but not like I did when I was 20 your still in the race see what you can do to minimize your bronchitis perhaps a warmer drier climate. I don't have bronchitis and I can feel my heart pound at 135 beats / min. keep going slow.

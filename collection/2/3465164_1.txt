You need to come here on a tourist visa and get married to him/her,  through justice of the peace.  . . Go to the INS webpage and it will tell you what you need to do to start filing the proper documents for residency.  . . My husband came here with tourist visa and we got married.  Its a long process but eventually you will get residency.  . . Once you come here and get married though, you can't go back to Great Britain or anywhere else because you will not be allowed to come back into the states.  . . Good luck and hope this helps!

The saying is "What you do is about who you are." Don't pick a occupation by earning potential, pick the vocation you are passionate about, what you enjoy, because you are going to spend the rest of your life doing it or hopefully something closely related. Do you want to help others? Travel? Work with animals? Work outdoors? Work with machinery? Work in journalism/writing? Work with children? Building things? Planning things? What matters most to you, gives you a feeling of accomplishment that you have made a worthy impact on the community and the world you can be proud of? Find or develope your intrests, what you consider "fun".

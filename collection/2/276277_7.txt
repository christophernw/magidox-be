The U.S. is a biased society because (1) it's historically been so and inertia is difficult to overcome and (2) it's been traumatized by the events of 9/11 and much of the populace has reacted reflexively to that which is seen as different or controversial. This reaction was initially seen in security policy, but has now expanded to other issues of personal liberty. Many of the issues you cite would have been brought up and acted upon by the current administration regardless of 9/11, but the inertia of changes in security policy has accelerated shifts in other aspects of public policy.

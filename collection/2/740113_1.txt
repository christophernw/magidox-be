Hi There,. This is a good question,actualy the oil companies makes the same profit margin offcourse the higher the price the higher is the cut.As for your Q. it is all about supply and demand...When the oil companies notice that the consumers dont mind paying for the gas at any price so why not putting it up? So the best way to reduce the price is to cut down the usage of gas in certain ways.How? If your car takes 20.0Gal to fill then put only 10.0Gal it will keep you going for 2-3 days depends...and when you ready for the next fill do the same....Now here is your choice that you have to decide aboout not minding stop to fill your car 2-3 times a week this way the price got to go down.You may ask whats the different between fill it up right away than 2-3 times a week?Yes there is, the oil companies has there own projection and study how much gas they would sell a day, if this estimation gose down then they have to consider to put down the price to reach the goal of sell they want,cause their oil Re-finery can not stop or reduce production so they have to cut the price down to increase the sell,also some facts about the gasoline, the product vapor at  (-40 C) and this means they have to empty their tanks ASAP, also the gasoline will go bad if it stays long time in storage. Put it this way what would happen if Half of city of detroit for example decided not to fill gas for one week and they will use other means to travell like buses motorbikes car pooling etc? it will be a price drop like nothing else, here in North america we have our own oil market and we do have lots of oil more than any country in the world, but the oil companies they would find any execuse to hike the price,.Thank You.. .

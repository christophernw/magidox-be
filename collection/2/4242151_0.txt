When, at a very young age, I would read spiritual material, I would have a clear reaction that said, "I knew that."  I did not know how I knew it, I just accepted the knowledge.  . . But to understand took practical application; that is, experience, that showed me that what I knew to be so actually worked in my life.   . . The method is to go within, and be with your own concept of "God", or whatever you choose to call It.  Be with that.  Ask, and find what you seek.

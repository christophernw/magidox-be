It's a church with a lot of disagreement in it - nothing wrong with that - they get into some pretty wild discussions at their national convention.  Southern Baptists in the Northern U.S. are a lot different than in the South, I think. I dated a girl whose Dad was a Southern Baptist minister - kids in their church were not allowed to dance, nor take gym class, nor wear shorts of any kind.

According to Christians the time you spend on earth is only the preparation of what you'll have in eternity. All the responsibilities you have on earth are given to you by God and you must fullfill them. Once you die and go to heaven, God will know if you were able to fullfill your purpose in life, then he'll give you your responsibilities you will have in heaven.. . Read the Book "A purpose Driven Life" It talks about your pupose her on earth and what you wil encounter in heaven. By the way I like to read a lot but I don't belive in God.

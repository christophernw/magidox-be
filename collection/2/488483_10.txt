The followers of Christ who awaited the Holy Spirit to anoint them for the work of Jesus to continue, that is that they would receive the same gifts as Jesus had to save the lost, began to speak in other languages on the day of Pentecost. .      This gift has been very much misused. Their is a difference between speaking in tongues in your own private prayer language and operating in the greater gifts of the spirit. It seems that Christians display this gift "overly much" to their own detriment as a way of showing that they have the Holy Spirit. When in fact this gift can be imitated by men and women who show very little love and do not have the other gifts - so they stand their waving their hands in the air and speaking gibberish but this does not mean that they have the anointing of God, even if they dance and spin around like a top. . "By their fruits you will know them." Do they have love?  Do you feel the Presence of God when a person gives a word of knowledge or revelation? Are people healed and saved? I could go on but enough said. God is real and the gifts are real and we all need to pray they be manifest in our lives that those around us be saved and believe in Christ and have a new relationship with God as Father, that His name be honored, His Kingdom Come, and His will be done in our lives.

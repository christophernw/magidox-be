I grew up in a family where perfection was always the goal. It has taken me many years to realize that doing my best is as perfect as it gets. Being satisfied with what I have accomplished, for many years, was impossible. I sometimes left projects unfinished because I just couldn't get them perfect. Some I never started. I have learned to look at my completed projects knowing I have done my best and say "It's just how I wanted it".. . I am a happier person now and look forward to beginning new projects because I know I can finish them with a sense of accomplishment rather than constantly pointing out the not-so-perfect elements to myself.

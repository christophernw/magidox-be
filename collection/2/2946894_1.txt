"Key Derogatory" means they want to rate you as "chargeoff" but they can't because they're missing some bit of information in the file. For example, you stop paying your bills, move and leave no forwarding address. The creditor may have a good idea where you live now (perhaps the post office sent them your new address) but they've not actually heard it from you. So you become a key derogatory instead of a chargeoff because they can't confirm your new mailing address.

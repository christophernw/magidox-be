First, some definitions..... . When a company needs to do something to fix a short-term issue that's called Tactical.. . When a company is thinking say, how it can add Â£20m to it's annual profits by say adding a new product line, that's strategy - it's about thinking long term about growth and change.. . So Strategic and Broad Thinking is all about seeing the big picture - it's about knowing where everything slots together at a high level - not how individual jobs are done in the company.

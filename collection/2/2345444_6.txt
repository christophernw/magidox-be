There are at least 4 different ways to do this: the easy way, the quick way, the powerful way, and the cheating way..  .  . The Easy way: put the cursor where you need the symbol, go to the Insert menu, Symbol, Symbols tab, Font: (normal text), Subset: Mathematical Operators, and scroll through the various symbols to get the  âˆš.  .  .  . The Quick way: In your formating menu select the Symbol font, turn the NumLock on, and with the Alt down type in numbers 0214..  . Since it is hard to extend the line as you requested for the Easy way and the Quick way, I'd recommend the Powerful way. However, if you want to use either of these two ways, you can still do it either by (1) using the overstrike font (in the font format) and define the bar (an ASCII symbol 175) as the overstrike character, or (2) by selecting a character and the bar, and setting their kerning to zero..  .  .  . The Powerful way: . Click where you want to insert the equation. . On the Insert menu, click Object, and then click the Create New tab. . In the Object type box, click Microsoft Equation 3.0. . Click OK. . Build the equation by selecting symbols from the Equation toolbar and by typing variables and numbers.From the top row of the Equation toolbar, you can choose from more than 150 mathematical symbols. From the bottom row, you can choose from a variety of templates or frameworks that contain symbols such as fractions, integrals, and summations. .  .  . The Cheating Way: Put whatever you want to take a square root of into parentheses or brackets, go immediately after the close of the parentheses, on the Format menu select Font..., hit the font tab, under Effects check the Superscript box, press OK.  Then type either 0.5 or 1/2.

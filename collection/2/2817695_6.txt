are you looking for natural remedies or medicinal?. . anyway, try ZICAM nasal gel.  it is over the counter, natural and works fast!  it cut my illness down to only three days from the usual 3 weeks i owuld have been sick.. . you can also try inhaling steam that has a few drops of the following essential oils: tea trea, eucalyptus and peppermint.  these will help to clear up the cough and kill the germs in your throat, nose and lungs without harming any other body parts.. . also drink lots of non-alcoholic fluids.  i would stay away from dairy as that thickens the mucous secretions and will make you cough/gag/clear yopur throat more.  try hot tea and honey.  sleep as much as you can.

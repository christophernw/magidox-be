English is the world's most widely-spoken language. The concept of English is not difficult to grasp because a lot of things are very consistent in the English language (making words plural, past tense, present tense, no irregular verbs or masculine/feminine nouns.) Most small children in developed European countries can speak English. However, a non-English speaker or someone who has learned very formal English will be confused by American English because we are very informal with our English. We use a lot of slang, and I'm from the Midwest where we end every sentence with a preposition. When you're taught such formal English, it's difficult to understand what we're saying at first.

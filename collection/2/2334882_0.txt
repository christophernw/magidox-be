I once saw a cloud in the shape of a giant puffy-eyed fish.  It was swimming through a blue ocean sky, and proceeded to consume smaller clouds in the shapes of the typical popcorn kernell, a bear face, and a cowboy boot.  It took about 5 minutes for all of this to happen, and then the giant puffy-eyed fish turned into the shape of something I can only describe as a radioactive bamboo shoot.

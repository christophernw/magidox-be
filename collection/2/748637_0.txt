I went to a SUNY School many years ago.  My financial aid was held up, but I think the fact of the matter was that the school had the money and didn't release it to us (they didn't admit that, of course).  If you take the hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in aid that a whole college gets, and you put that in an interest bearing account for 30 days, it probably generated thousands of dollars in interest for the school to add to it's operating budget for that year.

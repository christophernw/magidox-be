Actually its only your perception that we drive badly really its your jealousy getting the better of you,and we are better than you because if we were not we wouldn't have the money to drive nice cars...so get a life ...stop whining.. PS  old people drive badly...Italians drive badly  as do women and people wearing hats.....dogs are real bad . now i think about it I'm the only good driver out there!!!!!!!!!. . ps mr schumacher is a pretty good driver and hes got lots of money and 7 world championships

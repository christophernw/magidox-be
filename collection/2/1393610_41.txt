actually neither did very much.hoover did less but FDR did implement the new deal which created jobs for the jobless.he had dams built which ran people off their property like the TVA tennessee valley authority.he creat the CCCs, the civil conservation corps, which made jobs where there wasnt any.this was during the end of ww2. my father was a member of the ccc.he helpped build roads where there were none and cut timber for the government.FDR did alittle to help the jobless but in other ways he hurt a few thousand

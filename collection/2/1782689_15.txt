I think Hitler was an idiot because he was slightly deranged. He may have had some mental condition, and it was even speculated that some of it was due to the condition of syphilis that he may have gotten early on in life. . . When Paulus was in Russia, he should have allowed them to fall back, instead of insisting they fight to the last man, just like he did with Romel. Just like the old song goes, Ya gotta know when to hold em, know when to show em, know when to throw away, and know when to run, or something like that.

when it is travelling under water a sub uses the fins at the front. when they tilt upwards the sub will go up. when they tilt downward it will go down...when the  sub is not moving it uses it ballast tanks. the tanks flood with water then it sinks .the sub pumps out the water from the tanks and fills them with air,then it floats.

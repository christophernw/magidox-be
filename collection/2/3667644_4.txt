You could just turn on the radio for music, or pick out some of your favorite music that has a good beat. If the music makes you want to get up and dance, chances are other people will feel the same way. Depending on your age, most people will start out dancing in groups and then for certain songs pair off. Just don't force it. Things will flow fine.

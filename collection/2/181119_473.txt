A great summer job is to work somewhere that's along the beach, or if you don't live near the beach a place that is a tourist attraction.  Depending upon the job, you may end up making some REALLY good tips.  My suggestion--work at an ice cream place!  They make awesome tips and you can get free ice cream.  It's definately worth it!

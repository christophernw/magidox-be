Actually there is a quick fix. They sell a product (name escapes  me) that is like a clear epoxy. You clean the tank really good, dump this stuff in and roll the tank around in your hand to spread it around the inside and let it dry. I have used it once and it did the trick. Don't forget to remove the gas valve and filter screen first:) . You should be able to pick it up at an automotive store.. . On another note, when storing the bike for the winter, you want to make sure you tank is FULL. This will prevent rust as it doesn't let oxygen come in contact with the steel inside. Just add some gas stabilizer and your good to go.

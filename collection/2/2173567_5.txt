doing a bad job will only get your FIRED, in which case you can collect unemployment (like a loser).  The only way to get laid off is if your position is no longer offered and the company chooses to let you go.  (ie, downsizing).  You won't probably get a severance package unless it isn't your fault that you are let go.  . You could always start dating you manager and then see if they HAVE to let you go because of fraternization...but they may transfer you.  I don't think you will get very lucky with this one!

To the person who's writing it, it usually means they don't know what the woman's title actually is.  To the woman who's receiving the mail, it means that if some dingbat sees it before handing it to her, he's going to accurse her of being a feminist, as though she has some control over all the people who write snail mail to her.  Originally, it was supposed to break down like this:  Mrs. means the woman is married, Miss means she's unmarried, Ms. means she's a woman and leave it at that.

Brits aren't snobby.  Perhaps you've been watching too much Upstairs/Downstairs.  I've lived in England for 5 years and find they are normal, friendly, generous, and engaging.. And your question makes no sense.  It's like asking "Why are americans so rude, especially when they're the richest country in the world?"  One thing has nothing to do with the other.

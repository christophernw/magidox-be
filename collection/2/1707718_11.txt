Your question seems to derive from the belief of evolution/darwinsm. . . From the creationists point of view, it'd be due to the story of Adam & Eve eating the forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge of good & evil. I wouldn't call it an instinct, but rather the knowledge was passed on into humans with that bite of the fruit.

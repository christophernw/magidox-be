Yes, they believe in Freedom of Speech, but only want THEIR voice to be heard.  They don't want anyone from the other side to voice an opinion.. . I agree with you one hundred percent. . . They believe in Freedom of Religion, at least unless the religion is Christian, then the rules change again. Any OTHER religion is okay in their mind.

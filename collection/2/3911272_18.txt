Forget it, we are withdrawing partially, watch the news in the next few days... its already out in Britain.  The new Prime Minister of Iraq is calling for troop reductions.  . . We will then simply cut and run the best we can.  . . There was never a plan to do good there dude.  We already have our goals acomplished.  Set up the bases, gained control of the oil and set up a basic infrastructure so we can eventually reap major profits militarily and economically from that place.. . The people, ours and thiers, were just a means to an end as far as the planners are concerned.  . . There was a littel good, totally not appreciated by the Iraqis and many of the troos either.  They want us out, we want to leave.  In that state nothing can really be considered good.  It is like many who went there say "We had a job to do" thats all, now it is almost done we can pull some of the crew off.  . . Reconstruction of Iraqi people's needs and thier way of life was never an aim.  . . So if you think we are going to stay until it is built up like it was beofre even, you need to check your head.

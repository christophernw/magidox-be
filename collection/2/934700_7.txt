It's sounds like its on of the hardest things to do, but really all you can do is have some one on one time with your friend, and just tell her straight up no games, and no beating around the bush. Either she'll respect you and believe or she'll get a little mad. But as a friend its up to you to inform her about the situation, even if she gets a little mad, in the long run she'll definitely be grateful to you for having her back and telling her about him.

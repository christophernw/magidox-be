Oh Stop it!  You don't feel bad at all.  In fact you are thinking that it was pretty darn easy to get something for free.  So you are thinking of trying again, only something bigger this time.  Jewelry perhaps?  Then what? A car?  The next thing you know you are doing time for the next 35 years cause while in your stolen car you were being chased by the cops and after you killed the pregnant lady and her 2 kids she was holding cause you were just careless and stupid!  Sitting in your cell, you look back and wonder where you went wrong in life.  Because you STOLE a can of pop and didn't know what to do.! Go back and PAY for it!  First of all if you go back and tell the manager what you did, you may get more praise than you think, and next thing you know you will be owner of a chain of stores.  Funny how lifes decisions are important.  You know what to do, so just do it.

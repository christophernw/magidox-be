Thunder is the sound...lightning is the light.  There can be a few answers to your question.. . Visible light travels differently than sound.  Yes light is faster, and there's a delay until the thunder.  But imagine how sound waves are bouncing off of any object, whether it be the ground or building.  The light does that but at a faster speed.. . Not only do light and sound travel differently and at different speeds, but the wavelengths affect how you notice it.

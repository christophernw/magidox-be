It is not a question of who is going to work in the sun.  It is question of millions of people flooding into OUR country and taxing our system and not paying for it.  The illegals do not pay taxes, send millions of dollars back to Mexico and take advantage of our schools, hospitals, social services, police, fire, etc. They are driving down the wages of labor jobs and taking the jobs away from people that are willing to work for a fair wage.  SEND THEM ALL BACK HOME.  They are wrecking OUR Country!

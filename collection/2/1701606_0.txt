There are several reasons,but probably, the most important is STILL the least popular-PREVENTION. Safety measures, like instructions on not sharing needles, how to properly clean needles, or using condoms and how important it is in NOT spreading HIV or Aids, which are, one in the same, but HIV comes first, and if not treated it progresses into Aids, which, if not treated, you can die from. I'd say the worst problem we have now is that younger people, who weren't around to see the original outbreak, just don't want to use condoms because it "doesn't feel as good", when in reality, if you have sex with someone who has HIV or Aids (2ND stage) you can get it too. This is one of the main ways it is passed on. It goes on and on and on, due to the fact that alot of people STILL don't realize that even a microscopic "cut" in ones skin, is an "open door" to get HIV/Aids, and if you're not aware "they" had it, you too are going to pass it on to someone else. It's VERY contagious in this form, so get checked (if you feel you need to), and pick up some pamphlets on safety precautions on HIV/Aids which you can get at most health clinics....

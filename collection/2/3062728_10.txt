WE DID NOT EVOLVE FROM APES!!! . Charles Darwin said that we all evolved from one common ancestor. Humans and apes merely at one point, shared a common ancestor. And the evolution process takes millions of years and they are already evolved. Evolution does not work in that way, it works differently. if you want to know how it works ask it on the yahoo thingy.

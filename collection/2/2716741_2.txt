Don't listen to advice here on medical issues.  No one, not even a doctor is qualified to diagnose you here...you need an actual examination and/or testing from an md...go see one and get some peace of mind...it's probably nothing or very treatable but you won't know until you go!  Go girl! Or boy :)

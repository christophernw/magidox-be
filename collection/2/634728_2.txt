You've got issues if you're going to hurt your pets because they made a bathroom mistake.  :-(. . Is his litterbox really clean?  Keep it scooped at least once a day.  Consider buying a LitterMaid.. . Are there other cats?  Too many cats and too few boxes = cats making mistakes elsewhere.. . Is there anything upsetting near where the litterbox is kept? For example a new puppy kept downstairs in the same area as the litterbox will frighten away the cat. The cat will have no choice.. . Maybe the bathtrub less attractive for going potty.  Clean it well to remove any residual cat scent.  Try using a cleaner with a strong orange scent; citrus repels most cats.  If you have a shower curtain, keep it pulled back & up so it doesn't give him something to dig on.

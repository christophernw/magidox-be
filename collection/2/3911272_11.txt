The reason nothibg good is being reported is because the media want's more money. Here's how it works, most people hate Bush, so those people also hate the war. The media want's money so it reports what people want to see, and they want to see bad stuff from Iraq. But if you go to the midwest, or the south, because many people there like Bush and support the war, you will see more positive stuff along with the bad stuff.

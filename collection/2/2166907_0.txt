"wet" means a liquid is forming a continuous film on a surface rather than distinct droplets.. . On human skin, water is wet because there are weak chemical bonds between the protein molecules and liquids of the outer skin, causing water to distribute as much as possible because they are stronger than the forces keeping it in a droplet.

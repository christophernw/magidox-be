Girl hamsters don't seem to like handling, you've goto gently coax her out, start with just trying to feed her from your hand, then go on to stroking while she's still in the cage, then she should be ok when you take her out.. Remember though not to try and touch her if she's only just woke up, she probably gets grumpy.. . Also you should've known hamsters were nocturnal and read up about them before getting one.

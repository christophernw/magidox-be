It seem clear that most new mutation are deleterious. . Wild-type alleles are usually dominant because most mutation result in lowered or eliminated function.To be. dominant,the heterozygote has approximately the same phenotype as the dominant homozygote.This will typically. be true when the wild-type allele produces a functional. product and the mutant allele does not.. . Chromosomal rearrangements are often dominant mutations . because they can cause gross changes in gene regulation. or even cause fusion of several gene products.Novel activities,overproduction of gene products,or so forth,. are typical of dominant mutations.

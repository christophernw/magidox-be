He loves us so much that he gives the decision to us. to trust him back or not believe in him at all, but he does warn us about the paths we choose to take. Weather it's wrong or right decisions. What more can you ask for. God gave us The Bible, The ten commandments, All the story's to let us not to do the same mistake that thoughs have done in the past, and he gave us Jesus who died for us on the cross. All that God ask in return is his love, learn his teachings. Now how hard is that?

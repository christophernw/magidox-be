When treating bones for exhibition, it is common to first clean them of flesh using dermestids or annelids. Either bury the bones in a compost area sufficiently long that the flesh is removed, or place them in a plastic tub, and add a dermestid colony.. . Once the bones are cleaned of flesh, they may be soaked in hydrogen peroxide. Do not use bleach as it will decalcify and weaken the bone. For more information, do a web search on cleaning bone and/or dermestids.

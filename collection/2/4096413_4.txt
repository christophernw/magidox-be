ummm...everyone's body is different. some aren't made to hold a "six pack" shape. it could be that you have built the muscles in your abdomen, but that there is a layer of fat which blocks them from being visual. cut down on carbs (don't eliminate) and maintain your work-out schedule for a month. if you don't see results, just concentrate on some of your other features that you DO like. . good luck :D

June, this is a great question and I'm hoping that someone anwers it with a surefire remedy. I have the same problem with pine tress outside my house. My car is constantly covered with drops of sap. If you do not get the sap off in a reasonable amount of time, it becomes almost like cement.. . I had my car detailed a few years ago and the auto place charged me an extra $30 because of the sap. I paid it and asked them what they used to remove the sap. The guy told me he used a product called "Sap Off". He sold me a bottle of it for $10, but it was in a plain unmarked container. He probably bought the stuff in a 55-gallon drum and just poured me off a bit. It is a reddish liquid that's slightly thicker than water. I have never been able to find the stuff on the market. It worked better than anything I had ever tried, but it required multiple applications and a little elbow grease. The fresh sap was easiest to deal with. Some of the the older hardened stuff had almost adhered itself to my paint. Very frustrating.. . Some people have suggested butter/margarine, gasoline, Avon's "Skin So Soft", Wiindex, and Turtle Wax Bug and Tar remover. I have not tried these methods but the Turtle Wax product looks promising. Check out this link and good luck with the problem.. . http://www99.epinions.com/content_22183775876. . Fish

Because they like prostitution to be kept "underground" where they can't see poor, physically abused, disease ridden, former runaways, with no teeth, drug addicted, indentured servant women.  They'd much rather have that than legalize something that they think is completely immoral because anything that ain't of Christan morals can't be condoned, right? (even though legalizing Prostitution would save many thousands of women from the criminals that run illegal prostitution in the US today).

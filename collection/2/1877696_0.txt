It's not just paper and ink.  It has value because it is secured by the strength, reliability and stability of the US Gov't.  When you exchange money for something valuable (like food or beer), the merchant accepts the "paper and ink" because he has faith the the US Gov't will honor that currency when he goes to buy something useful with it.. . Simply printing more currency without proper federal accounting will cause an increase in supply, which would devalue that money proportionally.

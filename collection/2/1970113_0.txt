The same could be said about the Christians...the truth is most Muslims are NOT fanatics...nor are most Christians...but the fanatics are the ones that get in the news.  I assume it is natural for people to make conclusions when they only have a little bit of information...of course this leads to misunderstanding and war...and questions like yours.

Confidence. From experience I know that girls like a man who can ask them questions with confidence. Don't talk to her like your shy. Talk to her like you trust in your words and in yourself. First you have to build up the heart to tell her that you have a thing for her and what does she think about you. Then you have to just come out with the words that says "I like you and want you to be my girl".... This way y'all can work things out and see if a relationship will really work. Communication is the key.

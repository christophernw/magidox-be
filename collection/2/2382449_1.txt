What she is saying is that in her book, are facts,figures and stories that will be unpopular, and detrimental to certain people and probably she will name names,so in this "so called" memoir of hers, is lots of gossip - her side of the story.... nothing but "fodder"! - and her words now are too late, she is trying to cover her ass! she wrote this book to tell  and nothing more - and hide it under the word - memoir - the National Enquirer would have done it better..and she would have made more money.

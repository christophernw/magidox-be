Speak up. Make them aware of their negativity. Tell them that their negativity has an affect on other people. It brings them down. Joke about it. When you hear something negative from them say oh there you go again hows it going on the dark side I'm enjoying the light side. If they're female tell them that negative thoughts could result in weight gain. That isn't true but they don't know that. If making them aware of their negativity doesn't work either cut them loose or limit your contact with them it really does affect other people

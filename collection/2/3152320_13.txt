i hope you know that the cat is bringing you gifts. I know it is nasty, but the cat is kinda saying in its own way, here is a present. Its cute. My cat does this, but mice are nothing compared to the copperhead snake she killed and bought in. Otherwise, i guess you could say you cant take the hunter out of a cat, or its idea of being nice.

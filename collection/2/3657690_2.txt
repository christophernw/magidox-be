CDMA2000 1x, the core CDMA2000 wireless air interface standard, is known by many terms: 1x, 1xRTT, IS-2000, CDMA2000 1X, 1X, and cdma2000 (lowercase). The designation "1xRTT" (1 times Radio Transmission Technology) is used to identify the version of CDMA2000 radio technology that operates in a pair of 1.25-MHz radio channels (one times 1.25 MHz, as opposed to three times 1.25 MHz in 3xRTT). . . Thanks for the question!

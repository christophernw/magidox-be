Children today are lazy! i believe it is faulted on the parents.  Now a days kids just sit in front of the TV and if you ask them to do something they say ok but then they never end up doing.  Which means you are the one doing it.  so now they know that they can get away with being lazy they are now going to do it with every thing.

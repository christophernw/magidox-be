I don't really know, since I often struggle with the same questions myself. . . Part of it is that, as a kid, you have little else to think of...and as a kid, what you want is so easily accomplished!. . So, as you get older, not only are the goals harder to accomplish, but you've become experienced, beaten down, fearful, whatever it may be. . . Personally, I just try to remind myself each morning what it is I want, what my goal is, and that I have nothing to lose in pursuing it. Since the only other option is not pursuing it, in which case, I won't achieve it anyways. . . Good luck. Life ain't easy.

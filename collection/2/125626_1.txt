Grace unto you, and peace,. from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.. . What's to confess when "reconciled" unto God (2Cor 5:19)?. That God, in Christ, didn't law impute any sins to confess!. So why do chruches law impute sin, except for hell of it?. And dilemma they then have is $uch makes them all sinners.. . You are correct in suggesting God can't be one by division.. That's why Bible says real God is "excepted" from the shew.. That God is above the scape-goats -vs- dumb-sheep sides war.. Christ, who's first risen and seated right of left vs right,. notably also goes higher, to appear to God in heaven for us.. . Heaven: "higher than the heavens"...united "us"(one). Heavens: "higher than the earth"...divided (them vs them). Earth: earthy place of twice fallen baby-lon (them all). . Rev 12 notes 1/3 of the stars of "heaven",. first got drawn away, to divided heavens,. then also got cast down to the earth.. . "First, be reconciled to thy brother"(Christ),. (for until you do that, don't even bother God). Then also "be ye reconclied unto God", as one.. (for "there is no respect of persons with God"). . It's twice fallen bwd to "great"<-greater<-greatest,. requires twice risen fwd to great->greater->"greatest",. for only the "greatest" of "three things" never faileth.. . The "grace" of our Lord Jesus->Christ with you->all. Amen.

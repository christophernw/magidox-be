"Dandruff" can be dry scalp, styling product build-up or a fungal infection.  If it's REAL dandruff, it's a fungal infection and medicated shampoos should help it, though you may have to try a few different brands to find one that works for you.. . Ask a hair dresser or barber.  "Real" dandruff looks different from plain old dry scalp and he/she should be able to tell you which you have.  Best Wishes.

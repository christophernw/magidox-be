They SHOULD! That stinking poisonous second hand smoke floats around and sometimes you just can't get away from it. I believe smokers should do so in their own homes or automobiles and not in a public area including walking down the sidewalks because it's just as bad there. If they want to commit slow suicide that's them.  But there are quicker ways of killing themselves.

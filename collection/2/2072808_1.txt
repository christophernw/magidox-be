The whole expression is "If Muhammad can't go to the mountain, then mountain will come (must come, will have to come) to Muhammad".  It refers to two different, usually somewhat opposite, ways to accomplish the same end.  For instance.  You have your heart set on pizza for supper and decide to drive to the restaurant (M going to mountain).  But you look outside, it's pouring rain and you don't feel like getting wet, so you decide to order in (mountain comes to M).  So when you look outside and see the rain, you might say to yourself "Well, if M can't go to the mountain, then the mountain will have to come to M".

Have you any discharge coming from the inside of your ears? if so it maybe you have an infection which you could mean you need antibiotic ear drops (doctors) / perhaps you have a build up of wax within your ears which moves around when you chew (ask for an appointment with the practice nurse) to enble her/him to visualise what is happening within the ear channel. Otherwise it my be something to do with your synises. All the same its best to get them checked out by your doctor as soon as possible

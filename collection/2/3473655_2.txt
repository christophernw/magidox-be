Have some mats outside and inside, and have them trainined to stamp their feet. I have 3 dogs and have to go through this ritual often.. . I tried a tack mat (sticky paper) and the dogs hated it and learned to jump over it. . . I found that outside a rough surface mat was bet and inside an absorbent mat worked best.. . For really wet days, they have to stay and offer paws for towel drying.

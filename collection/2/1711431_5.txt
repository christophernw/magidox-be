Actually when someone is lying, they usually embellish things, they go on for too long and give too much detail. If they fidget or move about a lot, or keep touching their noses, or are unable to keep up eye contact, either they are uncomfortable or they are fibbing!. I find it's better just to be an honest person yourself and to expect the same of others. If people let you down, too bad, it's not the end of the world and it's their problem. We have to allow our friends the odd flaw you know.

I use an agent and just reviewed my policy. She was able to substantially reduce the costs.  Here are some of the things she was able to review:. . 1)  I have been a customer of the insurance company for a long time.. 2)  I also have homeowners insurance with them.. 3)  Both driver 3 and 4 (kids) have drivers training . 4)  One driver has "good grades" (b average).. 5)  Since car 2 and 3 are older cars driven by the kids, we removed the collion. That alone was almost $900 per year.. . In letting the agent know we were not on "autopilot" with our insurance, she became more agressive and sent it out to rebid.  Seems like our company (Travellers) had some new plans that were less expensive.. . But singlehandledly, I feel the best thing is to find a good agent and develop a relationship with them. You'll never know the ins and outs of insurance and it's worth it to have them on your side.

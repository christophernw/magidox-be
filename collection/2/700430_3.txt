Get yourself a good Thesaurus. It will come in handy both now & in the future when you wish to express yourself at your most intelligent and most accurate level.. They're kind of fun too. I'll look up a word in mine & find myself just reading a lot of them. The older, out of print ones have some really cool stuff in them.. But then I'm a book junkie, so maybe not so interesting to you.

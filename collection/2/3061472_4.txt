it's where the president doesn't sign or reject something for a certain number of days (right before congress lets out). This makes it so that, at least for that remainder of the year, congress can't override the president's veto because he hasn't vetoed it yet, I believe.. . However, a pocket veto can't really be used earlier in the congressional season.

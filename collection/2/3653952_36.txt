Don't let little things like that scare you.  Now, if they're a bunch of drunks yelling and screaming, THEN you ought to be scared.  It's not the flag that should worry you, but the attitudes of the people.. . Most people just think of it as part of their heritage, and as a symbol of independence, believe it or not.  Contrary to popular belief, the secession of the South was not about race.  Of course, nowadays, the few racists that are left will sometimes hide behind a flag, so you do have to be careful, but I'd say 99% of the people who use the flag have no issue about race.  . . Relax.

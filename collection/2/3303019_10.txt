Don't worry. All cats do that. They want your attion and your love. My sister moved out, and left her cat, Mittens, and now, he'll chase me around the house to get me to love him, and to hold him, and to cuddle him, oh. and to give him his canned food. hee hee. don't worry. your cat loves you. thats all. just love it back. scratch his ears or something, and if he or she doesn't like it them you know he or she is hungry, or needs to find the litter box.

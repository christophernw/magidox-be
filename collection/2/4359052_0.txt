The allantois is an extraembryonic membrane that forms during embryo development. The allantois functions in the exchange of nutrient, gasses and waste in mammals while in reptiles and birds, the allantois serves as a storage area for metabolic waste products.  In mammals, the allantois will develop to become part of the umbilical cord.

God created everyone! Charles Darwin is just a man, human, created just like the rest of us. Each of us are given choices in life. Some of us choose to go to Law School, some choose to be Doctors, some choose to live life in an unsavory manor. Charles Darwin chose to try to disprove that everyone and everything is created by God. If it were not Charles Darwins theory of evolution then it would be someone else's theory....because....God is in control and He knows you even before you were born. He has a plan for your life just as He had for Charles Darwin's life.

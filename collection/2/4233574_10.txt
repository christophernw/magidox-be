No one had ever seen a Dinosaur, how could they possibly mention one.. . They'd never seen Jupiter or Saturn either. . . They'd never seen a virus either.. . They'd never seen the Earth's Core either (that one would have come in handy when describing Hell).. . They'd never seen North America.. . They'd never seen Antarctica.. . They'd never seen TVs VCRs or Stereos.. . They'd never seen Crack Cocaine.. . They'd never seen Guns.. . There are so many things that were never mentioned in the bible, because the people of the time had never seen them . That does not mean they're not real.

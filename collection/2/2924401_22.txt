Animals tend to eat grass when they want to make themselves get sick, to relieve that ill feeling.  Mine does this every now and again, but not constantly.  They also do get some minerals from grass.  I found that switching my cats to a food for indoor cats (mine are in and out) that have greens in it, has greatly reduced their desire to eat the lawn.  I would be more worried about the fertlizers and such on the lawn, than the actual grass it's self.

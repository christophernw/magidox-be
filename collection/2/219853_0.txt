Death personified is an anthropomorphic figure or fictional character which has existed in mythology and popular culture since the earliest days of storytelling. Because the reality of death has had a substantial influence on the human psyche and the development of civilization as a whole, the personification of Death as a living, sentient entity is a concept that has existed in all known societies since the beginnings of recorded history. Death is usually shown as a skeletal figure wearing a midnight black gown with a hood. Sometimes, Death is portrayed as a dark, mysterious female.

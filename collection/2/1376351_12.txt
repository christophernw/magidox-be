Throughout  my school years it meant freedom. It meant a government for the people of the people and by the people. where we were taught freedom was worth dieing for and we were taught the great sacrifices our forefathers made in order to pass down this government that was run by its citizens where great men like Patrick henry said give me liberty or give me death! now I'm sorry to say it means the golden rule where he who has the gold makes the rules. we live under a greedy corupt government that doesnt care what the citizens of this country or anyother country wants large corporations and there wealth is the major agenda we have corporations who believe that by having large lobbies than can elect whoever they want and impose there laws and influence on every one else. we are one of the most hated countries around the world. our government has side steped the law and the very beliefs our country was founded on in order they say to keep us safe from terrorism.

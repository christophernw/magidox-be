As someone who can still remember when he was young, it seems to me that political discontent is as natural to young people as being obsessed with clothes and sex. The greatest majority of youth have never been much interested in politics, have been apolitical or have been outright antithetical to the current powers that be. It is like any rite of passage. When the callous superiority of youth passes at about age 30, then the once uninterested or turned-off become suddenly aware that politics is not all bad; they even run for office, and somewhere along the way, it even becomes important to them, not as something to ridicule or despise, but as something to pay attention to, to vote, and to participate in it in some way. It is just a cycle, part growing up.

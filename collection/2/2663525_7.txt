Frankly, this is something which has been going on since the evolution of humans! Women have always been protected from danger, nastiness and other worldly crimes! Plus, women with their emotionality, delicacy, innocence and home maker qualities are not the appropriate candidates for getting out at night! The freedome factor should be eually applied to men alike! Just because they are boys doesn't mean they get to go out at night and have a good time!!

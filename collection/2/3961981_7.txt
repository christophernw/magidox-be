Negro means "black" in the Spanish, Portuguese and ancient Italian languages. Africans were literally "black" as black can be. when the Europeans came to Africa it only made sense to them to call them that. the color brown that you see in modern times is because many Africans were raped by white slave owners so the color isn't dark black anymore. (this is not opinion this is simply the thinking of people during that time.) I'm black by the way.

It is mainly because of the strong ties that bind the peoples of Asia that I think contributes to this sort of non-racially diverse population.  But also, it is because of the nationalistic pride Japan has, for example. This, I think is a good sign not actually a bad one as they conserve their own traditions, cultures and beliefs.

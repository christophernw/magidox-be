depends on the age of the duck, if very young NON_ medicated poultry starter if at least 6-10 weeks then again NON_medicated poultry pellets mixed with a good quality 3 grain scratch. (only a 3 to 1 mix it's like candy to them) this scratch looks like cracked corn. and the pellets are very important to be NON-medicated. NOT the stuff used for chickens.

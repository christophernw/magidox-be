I read about this somewhere a few years ago.  TV manufacturers claim that because there's usually music and the voices are over it, it just sound louder.. . Others say for volume there is a range and that commercials transmit at the maximum range to get your attention.. . I guess it's good for when you leave the TV to go to the fridge, if it gets too quiet, it's time to go back, your show is on.

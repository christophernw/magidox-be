Hello my "nature loving tree hugging magic casting Pagan". Sounds like you just don't want to know if Christians all over really have a lower IQ. . . There are plenty of well educated Christians with high IQs. Many of them are in positions of leadership within this country. It takes quite a bit to become a leader in any position (whether political or business) And plenty of them are engineers. It's strange how many electrical/computer engineers are Christian, but they are. I don't know personally about the Bible belt though.

I'll give you a real answer, hun.... . I've always looked at girls slightly different from all of my friends... I'd say a girl's very preety, and they look at me like im crazy...My attraction to women started at a very young age...and i never found myself really attracted towards men...I only saw tham as friends and never really "liked" any of them.... .  I was struck with curiosity at 14....questions like"what does it feel like to kiss another girl?" and "Is it possible that I can have a relationship with a girl?" Then I finally started expirementing with my attractions towards other girls...I stared coming out as "Bi" with the fact that there was maybe a slight chance that I may meet a nice guy... I went on a date with one guy and it was just akward...and just stuck with women.... . Nice story, ain't it???

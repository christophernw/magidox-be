These religions all believe in evangelism, which can be defined as going forth and spreading their faith. (Jehovah's Witness especially since they beleive they are rewarded for this.) Born-Again Christians (or Protestants)and Mormons both believe that "the Word" of God must be brought forth and shared with the world, since someone had to first share it with them. I know that many other religions, such as Buddhism, Islam, Catholism and some others expect you to determine for yourself that their religion is the correct faith and that you must seek their ways on your own. I know this doesn't apply to all religions that don't belive in evangelism, but I'm pretty sure that it applies to most.

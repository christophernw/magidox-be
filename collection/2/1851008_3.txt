What other ppl have said is mostly an ideal 'flowery' way of solvong the problem , be it educating, humanity, love etc. The problem i believe lies in the basic human instinct of making oneself SECURE and Happy . And when their are millions of us on the earth with the same urges,and instincts, ones happiness is surely gonna encroach upon another guys due to competition at every level say, housing, jobs and even hot chiks, which in simple words brings happiness to a human.. So racism is one way ppl try to secure their space and happiness by joining large  groups and safegurding each others interests. Other problems also arise due to the same cause, like terrorism and  and corruption but racism has hit the world for long and bad because there are large numbers of ppl (and their votes) involved,  and larger the group , the stronger they are. Forces of democracy, u could say. .    Not that only democracies have racism. Middle east where the rulers are biased and represent one community also face the brunt of racist/communal riots. But I haven't heard of racist fights in China which is a populous country with minimal democracy. I found the link below about the type of racism in China.. So the trick to cure the disease is, I say, give everyone his share of happiness and handle the miscreants quick and hard.

Most of the time in Chinese food there is an ingredient called ginger. Ginger has been known, even in ancient times to cleanse the bowel system. As for the spaghetti, most likely there is a bit of Basil and/or Cilantro in it. As a Culinary instructor and a certified herbalist I tend to shy away from these ingredients myself. The herbs in the spaghetti are meant to cleans the entire system, including the pallette.

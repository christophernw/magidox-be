I didn't know this either (though I knew the term and the song "Take me back to dear old Blighty"), so I was fascinated to find that it comes from a Hindustani word, bilayati, meaning 'foreign'.. . It's odd how some people get labeled as 'foreigners' in their own country. The words 'Wales', 'Welsh', 'Cornwall' and 'Walloon' as well as the French for Wales (Payes de Galles) and the Latin for France itself 'Gaul' or 'Gallia' all contain an element that means 'foreign'.. . Blighty is a word no longer used of England, though it might be heard in a sort of jokingly archaic way.

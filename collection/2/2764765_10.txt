Studying 17-18 hours a day is actually not a good idea.  I only spend 5-8 hours a day studying and it requires a lot of concentration.  Way back when I really study hard for my every subject as I need to maintain my grades.  I do not watch TV except for weekends.  . . Actually, studying needs a lot of discipline.  To give you some tip on how I can take studying too long up to 8 hours, well, after 30 mins., I rest for about 5 mins. to unwind myself then go back again to what am I studying about.  Next, I make sure that I am in a good condition to study my lessons and refrain myself from excuses like... okay, I will watch TV first or I will do my project next day.  If there is enough time, I will advance all my projects and do my assignments although it is not due on the next day.  In this way, I avoid myself cramming and staying late at night.  Some people said that mornings are the ideal time to study because your mind is relax and all the info will sip in your mind.  . . Spending 17-18 hours a day will make you burn out and sick physically. I don't think a genius do this.  I don't know about scientists...

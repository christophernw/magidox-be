There are many disadvantages to a planned economy.. . Firstly, the state determines what is to be produced and where therefore consumers' wants and needs are not considered nor can they exercise any influence in production decisions. Secondly, consumers have less choice since they have to use the standardized goods produced by the state. Since there are no profits or competition, people running the factories have no incentive to innovate, take risks or increse efficiency.

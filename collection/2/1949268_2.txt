We, ordinary citizens, let liberal, feel-good people take our rights away.  We let them put both parents to work, so that kids were raised by child care services.  We let us be dependent on two salaries, so there was no room for home life.  We let them take prayer out of school, we let them feminize our male population, we slowly let them take our rights one at a time.  We have voted people into office time and again to represent us without checking their voting record.  We kept them in power and let them give themselves raises while increasing taxes on us.  We let them take God from us.

The earth‘s surface is solid with exception of water (which has. rock below it). Under this core there is a layer of molted rock . and beneath that the is a mixture of rock and iron, and the . centre part is molted iron which is the generator of the greater. part of gravity. In space, any substance that has weight has. a gravitational force. This explains the reason that satellites. are launched close to the equator and in the direction of the. rotation, allowing centrifugal force to equal gravitational force.. Now NASA are about to launch a polar orbiting satellite which. will go into an elliptical orbit, closer at equatorial regions and. further when over polar regions, and should have a lateral. displacement owing to earth‘s spin influencing lateral movement.. PS Earth‘s liquid core spins faster than the outer crust which . makes NASA‘S mathematicians work a little harder.

because when an animal evolves, it does so completely independently. the entire race doesn't evolve all at once. think about it, ya prune.... :-). . this is why we have many different breeds of dog, for one thing --- and dog breeding itself is a very good example of genetics and a little bit of evolution in action. starting from the common grey wolf, our hairy companions have developed, and been out-bred to the extreme, into a very wide variety of animals. but as they have evolved and changed, we haven't ended up with all dogs and wolves looking the same as each other. . in fact we could say evolution is the opposite of what you seem to be thinking - instead of bringing all animals evenly towards some kind of ultimate goal (thinking that this = humans, by the way, is a narrow worldview in itself), it creates massive diversity by it's very nature. Which is why we have bonobos (allegedly even closer to us than chimps), chimpanzees, gorillas, homo sapiens, orang-utans, baboons, common monkeys, barbary apes, aye-ayes.... etc etc etc.... rather than one type of ape.

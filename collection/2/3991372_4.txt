Hey mate..same problem here.I gat my semester exams from 20..6 subjects in all...oops,data structures in C,ppl,OR and many more.. Just make a daily routine and stick to it...Like log in to  yahoo answers for the specified time periods..and during study time just concentrate..and give sittings of 45 minutes each..not more than 45 mins in a single stretch if you are trying to learn and grasp up things( if its theory exam).... ALl the VERY BEST for exams.....

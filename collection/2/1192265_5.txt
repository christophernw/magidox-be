premature ejaculation isn't a medical problem... a quick fix for tht would be to masturbate with/without your partner. its a known fact tht men who haven't had sex in awhile tend to shoot first. try to also get a thicker condom...and practise finding your 'point-of-no-return'...masturbate to the point you are about to blow...then ease up..do it a few times get to know how far you can push it before you come...

First you have to realize why you want to write this book, then you have to know the basics to writing a book like the  rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution, you need to also figure out the plot, Characters and the style of the book (fiction non-fiction, comedy, romance ect...)then just start writing about anything you want, try not to look over it until your done because that is the best time to make your changes to the book plot and anything else and last but not least get some one to correct your work and create a title....

Here's the CORRECT answer. For starters, you need to take the vehicle to a competent mechanic to have the condition of the rest of the front end parts inspected. Then, assuming your friend didn't botch the tie rod job, you should have the front end aligned. Also, you should have all 4 tires checked for proper balance. . . If the front end's been aligned, all 4 tires are balanced, and it STILL vibrates, then you may have another bad component in your front end....ball joints, inner tie rods, idler arm, etc.. . But first of all, take it in and have someone who knows what they are doing inspect the front end, without delay, and don't drive at highway speeds until you do, or you can do damage to the car, and potentially to yourself if something breaks.. . Hope this helped.

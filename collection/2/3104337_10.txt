my cat likes to destroy things - like toilet paper rolls and paper towel rolls.  He also finds plastic bags and licks them.  I am fairly certain he doesn't use the litter box at all while I'm gone, I think he saves it until I get home so I can smell the aroma...My other cat sleeps all day, I leave and she's sleeping and I come home and she's still sleeping - in the same place.  Whats funny is that the one who sleeps all day is actually in better shape. Whats up with that?. I wish my cats ate cookies - that would be hilarious.

It's an old instinct that have stuck with them. Wolves in the wild who would often sleep in tall grass or snow, would have to flatten a bed for themselves. They would turn in a circle (sometimes it's three, sometimes it's more) until the snow or grass was flattened down, then they'd lie down to go to bed. This practice would also help them observe their environment; were there any prey or insects under the brush? Rocks?

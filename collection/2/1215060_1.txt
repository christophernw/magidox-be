You're not really an atheist if you are open to the possibility of god's existence. You are agnostic. . . I am atheist. If the truth were told, I am as close-minded as a believer. I have no doubt in my mind that god doesn't exist. The difference is that a believer feels compelled to try to spread the 'truth' as they see it. I don't threaten or attack anyone UNTIL they try to convert me to their religion and cram their religious beliefs down my throat. And, yeah, I do get very angry when they say things like ' A raped woman who has an abortion will burn in hell'. I find this a vile thing to say. I have never, ever reported anyone on here and never will simply because it's a petty and  pointless activity.. . If they didn't interfere with me, I would be perfectly happy to leave them alone to their beliefs but they seem unable to do that.

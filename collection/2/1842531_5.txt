Sarcasm is the process of mocking or making fun at the expense of another using irony, where your meaning is opposite of what is said, or occasionally to call attention to a certain un desirable situation. Sarcasm can be identified with placing stress on certain key words and/or by using words that would show an inappropriate amount of earnestness and/or by comparing the seemingly positive elements of the sentence in question with obvious negatives. In writing sarcasm, care must be taken to show equivalent stresses to vocal tones, such as by capitalizing, italics, etc. or by ending a sentance with an exclaimation point to show blatant over-eagerness, etc.. . Examples:. Oh totally, I would so absolutely LOVE to go to the dance with you!. Gee, THANKS, mom, I always wanted a new pair of underwear for Christmas.. No, don't worry about it, I honestly like doing your laundry in addition to cleaning up this pig sty of a house and cooking every %*#$ing meal, no matter how tired I am after working all day at my dead-end job, etc.

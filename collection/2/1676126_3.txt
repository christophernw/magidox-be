The Roman Empire, considering the legacy they left behind... All the latin languages came from latin, the romans language, some of their constructions and roads are still standing and used in our days.Also their strategy in fights at the time and long time after, before the rifler appeared, was copied even by others empires.Also, considering that they conquered almost the whole world known at the time, they did a pretty good job... :)

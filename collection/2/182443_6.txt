go to a pet supply place if the matts ar not already down to the skin and get what is called hard brissled slicker brush looks like a lot of little pins on it ... start at the top of the mat and slowly as it breaks up add more hair to what you are brushing and in no time it will be out. if you cant get your fingers under the matt and it has gone to the skin the best thing to so is have a groomer clipper down your cat.

Therapy really can't hurt you and it might help you realize that there is nothing wrong with you. We all have issues with relationships and our parents or the whole world in general. The important part is in how you choose to deal with those issues.. . The first thing you should understand is that you are just as good as anybody else, not better or worse but just as good. For that reason you deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, just like anybody else. Most often, women who end up in relationships with jerks and cannot seem to meet a nice guy is because they think they've done something wrong and don't deserve a nice guy. In every case they are wrong. . . Go see a psychologist and see what they can do for you. But always keep in the front of your mind that you are a decent person. It helps and it is true, whether you believe it right now or not.

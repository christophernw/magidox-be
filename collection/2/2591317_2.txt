Alex, not everyone is a jerk. There are a lot of very caring and nice people right here on Yahoo Answers. You're being unfair. Some people are jerks yes, but most of us arent. If you need a friend or advice this is the place to go. I love these folks here. They are wonderful. You just haven't been around the right people. You can make a lot of friends here if you let yourself open up to them. Take care and don't be so down, sweetie.

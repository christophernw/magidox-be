Nowadays, blueprints are dsigned with special software like AutodeskÂ´s Autocad.  Blueprints or instructions to build anything, from a screw or a sprocket to an entire building, are called blueprints because in the old days, they were made with a special kind of ink called "heliographic blue", therefore, if you want to make a "blue" blueprint, you need to get that kind of ink and paper first.

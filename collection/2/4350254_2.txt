None whatsoever,Why do u think all around the world Smoking is being banned in public places more n more.. Especially around young children, as it causes SIDs (sudden infant death) around babies.. This is amongst a multitude of respiratory/heart diseases that  you can get from prolonged smoking.. More n more Doctors/Surgeons will not operate if you do not stop smoking, I can go on n on as it killed my Mom so I hate smokers.....

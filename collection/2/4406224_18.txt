I don't mean to be cynical, but you might as well be reading the latest Spider Man Comic.  I was raised Catholic and do believe in God, but I also believe in History and Archaeological fact.  Look at all the evidence that has been found; the ancient manuscripts, Gospels and texts.  Most of the bible (as we know it today) has been twisted and contorted to provide society with a male egotistical view; so as to maintain power and control (and not to mention financial prosperity).  I think everyone needs to reconsider these old teachings and look beyond them.  . . I think Gods true message is being missed altogether!

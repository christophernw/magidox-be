because organic compounds are covalent, you need ionic compounds or ions to conduct electricity, in more details, electricity is made up of electrons, in order for it to go through something the electrons must have a path, they basically move in and out of atoms to get through, if you have a covalent compound there is no room for them because the atoms are already stable, ionic compounds on the other hand allow electrons to move in and out of their atoms - so yeah there u go

if you're using 'queen' as euphemism for homosexual then you do have a point. The palace has an unspoken tradition for employing large numbers of gay men which is thought to have begun years ago to ensure the daughters of royalty would not succumb to temptation.. . I worked at the palace for 2 years and gay men outnumbered straight by 8 to 2 easily.

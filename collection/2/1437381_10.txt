If you haven't used your icecubes in a day or 2 dump them out and let the icemaker deliver new ones.  If the icemaker has been off for awhile the first batch will have been sitting there in the tray a long time and will probably have to be dumped too. It takes time for ice-cubes to absorb food flavor/scent. Plus a good water purifier on the icemaker in the refrigerator eliminates the onion like taste that we had in our ice-cubes. Lastly, make sure your food in the freezer is well sealed.

Wow, you sound like you are really struggling. All that emotional upheaval must be exhausting and draining!! First, I think you should explore different therapists. It doesn't sound like you are actually doing any psychotherapy...just medication. Secondly, most people here I'm sure are saying it sounds like bipolar. I think you should research Borderline Personality Disorder. You might see some similarities. I'm by no means saying you have it, but it's another avenue to explore. There are some effective treatment strategies used in conjuction with BPD that you'd probably benefit from. They work to help change thoughts and behaviors rather than just using medication. But the key is that you really HAVE to want to get help and you have to be willing to work hard. No reward will come easy....good luck and I hope you can feel some relief soon.

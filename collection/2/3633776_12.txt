Friend, I have many times as a Christian said there is a certain point of evolution, such as a tappole turning into a frog, & maggots, into a fly & so on, But don't think you are tricking me with your question, no way, You state your question & then you turn around & answer your own question by saying RIGHT. No you are not right, Because the whole theory of evolution is that man came from a sliming pond somewhere out in the jungle or we evolved from Monkeys or apes. So the whole THEROY & a Theory is something you presume but don't really know, I don't presume. I know. that evolutionists ideals of evolution is not right. Yes you try to use one or 2 things that I just mentioned to you & you try to build a whole concept around everything evolved. Well, you just got a hold of a Christian that has been serving God over 36 yrs. I am not dumb. Any questions, anyone wants to put out there concerning scriptures I am willing to answer, if it is not a stupid question, them I will leave it with the head it came from.

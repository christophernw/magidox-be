Technically, the answer is that in 404 BC, Athens surrendered to the Spartans. The Spartans tore down the walls of the city, barred Athens from ever having a navy (which was THE most powerful navy) and installed their own government (the Thirty). At this point, the Age of Athens ended. I personally think greed and arrogance brought the decline of Athens.

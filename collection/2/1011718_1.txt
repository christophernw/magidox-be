What I did was to start aerobic exercise sessions, three times a week. These (especially the step routines) really helped reducing the fat in my thighs and calves.. I added to the routine by doing the stairmaster every other day.. And I know what they say about spot reduction - but the fact is, during any exercise routine, fat reduces first from the legs, then from the stomach. so you will see the results in your legs first. I lost 3 inches each from my thighs, so i know this happens :)

I say excuse me out loud , so that the people ten feet away can hear me. It's not being rude, it's just being kind enough to inform the parties in front of you that they're  creating a bottleneck in foot traffic.. Some people really don't care if you're held up or not by their being in front of you. Like baby strollers side by side going no-where. That's why I raise my voice, to get every ones attention. It works.  If not, repeat your self as often as you see fit. People behind you appreciate your attempt to get through as well. People obstructing you are inconsiderate by creating such a hold up. They think nothing of it. Especially at malls.  . Be nice about it, but be bold also. Sounding like a little church mouse won't accomplish anything .So be nice, but be heard.

For starters let me address Lobik, atheism is no more a religion than bald is a hair color.   now for the answer to your question, I became atheist after I began looking into urban legends as one of my hobbies.  I began to realize how easily people are duped into believing something with no factual basis to it.  Religion seemed to fit into the same realm as urban legends do.

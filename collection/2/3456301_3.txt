this is the u.s. and because it's the us, we love food. now... if you're the kind of person like me who loves to read, then you should know that reading and eating at the same time can give a certain calmness to one's self (not to get emotional and stuff).  suffice to say, two pleasures at the same time can be very fulfilling. even if it is as simple as reading and eating.

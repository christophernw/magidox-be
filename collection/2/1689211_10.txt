I have never heard the Vicks remedy and I bet it is a old wives tale. My husband had this problem for years and nothing worked until we tried Oil of Oregano. You put a few drops on the toe and under the nail every day for several months, but you see results almost right away. You can get the oil from any place that sales Essential Oils and I order it from the internet. My husband stopped putting it on when it got better, but it came back, so I recommend using it for 3-6 months. His is completely gone now after a year. His toenail was so thick that I would have to cut it with a razor and file it down because the clippers would not go around it. He treated the toes on either side of it too just in case. You can also use Oregano Oil for lots of other things. It will clear up a cold or sinus infection in a few days and my dentist told me I had the beginnings of gum disease and I started putting a drop in my toothbrush when I brush my teeth and my dentist is amazed that my gums are completely cleared up. Look it up on google and you will see all the uses for it.......It really works !!!!!

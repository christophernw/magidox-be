My parents had this problem too, I'm assuming you mean mud swallows, they make a horrible mess.  My parents would spray Pam underneath the eaves where the birds would try to form a nest.  It kept them from getting a foot-hold and also would make the mud slide right off so the poor bird would eventually get tired and give up.  Give it a try, its inexpensive and won't hurt the bird either.

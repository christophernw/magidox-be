A lot of people have already told you good ways to not cry. But I don't think you should stop yourself from crying when cutting onions! At least you are cleaning your eyes when you cry and nothing sad is MAKING you cry. And it is always good to let out your emotions throught crying, even if you are chopping onions!. . Hope this answers your question!. Nk92. :)

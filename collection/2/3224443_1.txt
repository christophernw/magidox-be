Its a short form of 'God Bless You' and in German, its 'Gesundheit'. Similar terms exist in many languages. The reason for this is that long ago, people thought your soul was in your breath. And that if you breathed too hard out, like in a sneeze, your soul could go out of your body, and not get back in. So they thought sneezing was a near death experience, and made a little prayer to save the spirit or soul of the sneezer.

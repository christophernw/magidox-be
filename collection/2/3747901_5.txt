Paul rebuked the Galatians for this very reason as they were saved and after this they started to keep the law. Paul called them fools as he couldn't believe that they had been made perfect in Christ and then after wards started to keep the law as well. Note here that the law was only ever given to the Children of Israel and never to us (Gentiles)

You need a co-signer if the lender determines you're financially-unqualified to buy the car on your own. The idea is that they'll be able to hold someone responsible for the loan who'll actually have the income that would allow the lender to squeeze it out of them in court, if it comes to that.. . They can't very well hope to squeeze you if they know nothing'll come out when they do, right?

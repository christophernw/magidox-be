I've just read some of the stupid answers you have received. I am an alternative medicinal therapist and I use massage, herbal, acupressure and nutritional therapy for my clients who suffer from this. I myself suffered from migraine. Now let's see if we can't sort you out. Firstly, the cause of your headaches. Do you have a stressful job, or perhaps you have a quick temper, either way you neck and back muscles are constantly being held in tension, you can buy a 'tens' unit, this omits a small electrical charge that stimulates the muscles and releases the tension. You can go for aromatherapy massage or visit an acupressure clinic. My favourite is FEVER FEW  capsules, taken over a period of time they are very beneficial in migraine and associated headaches. If all else fails go and see your GP you may need a brain scan.In a lot of cases headaches are a symptom of something else,like high or low blood pressure, kidney, liver, digestive problems get yourself checked. If you live in the area of Margate-Ramgate pop in and see me. If you need anymore advice e-mail me on: alternative@medicine123.wanadoo.co.uk. . . Gloria

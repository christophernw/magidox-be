In case nobody here has ever gon through the enlistment process, or know how the process works, it all starts with A.S.V.A.B. scores. The highest scores are heavily recruited first, and then it works downward. THere is a minimum cut off score. Below that the point, the military does not have the resources to educate on that level. No do they have the desire to deal with the unmotivated.. Kerry should have said that the uneducated will end up at some dead end job that even Illegal Mexicans wont do.

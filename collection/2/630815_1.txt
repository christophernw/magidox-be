I think peoples ideas and thoughts and feelings on nudity come from either religion based ethics or the way they were raised. Yes I think that in some walks of life or countries it is. The human body is something just to be shared between husband and wife. There is nudity and then there is porn...the 2 get confused. There has been nudity in art for years.  I bring up my children to think of nudity as being natural. I don't flaunt it but I don't run to cover myself up if they come into the bathroom or my room, why make them think it's wrong. I think it helps them to grow up with a healthy attitude towards their own bodies. Too many kids grow up with hangups.... why should this be one.

wow...does this question make me smile:). . We are all children at heart. One way to stay young is to be around younger people. Children as an example.. . I have great fun playing with my children on the floor, watching games, coloring and having a blast.. . I suggest that you play with some children and borrow their toys for a day or so. With The holidays coming there will be loads of new stuff for you to play with and me, also ;). . Have fun :)

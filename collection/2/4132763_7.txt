This song will help you remember, it is the tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star". I use it to teach my students:. . Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. These are planets, they're not stars. Jupiter and Saturn are really vast. Uranus and Neptune are not last. Pluto is the very last one. All nine planets orbit the sun. . :-)

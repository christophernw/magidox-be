The extra electron in the negatively charged ion makes it bigger for a couple of reasons:. 1.  there's more electrons in the house, takes up more room. 2.  the negative charge is bigger than the positive charge that is 'sposed to counteract it, so the electrons get more room to move around.. . I think of it like juggling.  Say you're the nucleus and you've got two protons in you.  Your two protons can balance the negative charge of two electrons.  Like two balls, one in each hand.  If you were to try to hold onto three electrons it'd be difficult for you, only having two hands and three balls to take care of.  You'd have to juggle.. . Then, one of those electron balls would always be flying away from ya for a second before you could grab onto it again.  And when you did, another electron would be running away...they'd be further away, from you, Mr. Nucleus.. . Thats all i got.

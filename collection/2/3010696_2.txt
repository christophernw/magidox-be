The restraining order will restrict the respondent from entering or coming near your residence, so it will be impossible for the respondent to live there, unless you voluntarily move out.. . In most states, even if the victim gives permission for the respondent to live with them or otherwise violate the ordered space (often 500'), the respondent is still considered to be violating the restraining order and can be arrested.. . If you want to lift a non-temporary (no time limit) restraining order, you must request a hearing. The clerks where you filed the complaint can tell you how to do that.

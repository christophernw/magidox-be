Christians do not believe in the theory of Evolution. Evolution explains the creation of Earth scientifically, and evolutionists feel they have an explanation for everything. They think that we all evolved from dinosaurs. . Christians believe that God created Earth and there is no such thing as evolution, thus believing that dinosaurs never existed.

It is dying if it's a cold water fish take it out and put it in a bowl of fresh water and leave it for a few hours in the mean time clean you tank esp. the filter & boil the stones then refill and add some stress coat &/or water conditioner this happened 3 of my fish they weren't quite dead and by leaving them in a basin overnight they came back right as rain - 3 months ago - hope it helps

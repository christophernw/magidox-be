Get your vet to check it out. We've just fostered a rescue dog who has the same thing. Initially the vet tried to reduce it with steroids etc but it's just grown, so it looks like he will operate.. . It's most likely a tumor but don't panic, it's probably harmless - a lot of dogs get them, but it will cause discomfort to the dog if not seen to.. . Better safe than sorry right?!

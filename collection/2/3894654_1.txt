I guess it's possible, like LCM( 2.4 , 1.5 ) = 12, but does it have a use?. /. To formally define LCM for rationals:. Let A=(p/q), B=(r/s). LCM(A,B)=AC=BD. . where C and D are relatively prime numbers. . so for above example, 2.4*5=1.5*8=12. /. . EasternStar, you are justifying your point by using a circular argument. Also, please understand that fractions can be converted into decimals, and vice versa.. . I like to keep an open mind; however this seems to be progressing into an argument over definitions - these are usually futile.

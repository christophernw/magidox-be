Some foods the Amish are famous for are the Shoofly Pie, Jams and Jellies, and breads.. . The website Amish.net has links to where you can buy all types of Amish foods and baked goods, as well as furniture, crafts, quilts, etc.  . http://www.amish.net/. . The website "Amish Dining" has tons of recipes.  . http://www.amishdining.com/. . Since the Amish don't typically support technology I'm not sure how all these things get on-line, but they seem to be accurate sources and good recipes.

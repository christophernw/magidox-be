There is only one way to stop religious war, and that is to teach each other to love each other as one..  Religious war is caused by the division of beliefs and those religions. There may be different religions of many gods but our world was the creation of ONE god. We, humans and all other living creatures were created from one, broken and divided to create individuality (for continuance), like the different religions. That's what separates Nations, and the people within those Nations. . WIll there ever be peace, I doubt it, but I do believe we can learn to live with an understanding to appreciate the divided Nations, for their own religion and beliefs and still stand together united- We can live in hope can't we!!!

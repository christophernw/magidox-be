If a person continually sabotages friendships and relationships they could be suffering from a mental condition called "Borderline Personality Disorder." (BPD). These type of people thrive on drama and conflict in their lives, and can be very obsessive in pursuing the relationship, but then once they attain it will break it off for no apparent reason. If this sounds like the person(s) you're talking about and you want to find out more about BPD, there is a great book on the subject called "I hate You; Don't Leave Me."

Blaming Russia is not the way to deal with the problem.  What we have in UK is 'innocent until proved guilty'.  Before any guilt can be laid upon the Russians, there has to be proof that they 'done it'.  That proof, if it exists, has yet to be found.  The fact that one man has died and another, now said to have ingested the poison, may die also, does not prove it was the Russians 'what done it'!

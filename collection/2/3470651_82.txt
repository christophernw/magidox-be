You should all be glad you don't have to shake my hand or bump into me. I walked to the front of my church to get a special sticker for childrens church, where I was teaching. When the revered held out the sticker, I reached for it and a blue flash of electricity like lightening crackled and popped like a 22. From then on if we met in the same hallway or anywhere else; he would either get as far away from me in the hall etc. or, we'd  hi 5 each other. When that happened he say, "Gimme 5 to keep me alive."  Believe me, I can hurt a person; I have brought people to tears with my "electric" personality.I hate that this happens and hurts anyone. But try this and I think you will be pleased. Take fabric softner and mix roughly half and half. If where you live is really dry, try 2/3 softner and the rest water. Place these amounts in a spray bottle. Now, spray your carpet in your home, car including upholstry. Don't saturate the fabric just mist till a bit damp. Let air dry. Do same around your office; if you work in one to. Do your chair also. Make sure you used softner in your clothes too. I have even put a little in a container to do a final rinse when doing my hair as well. You can't totally elimintate it; but this will sure help a lot.Leather car or office seats? Make a "slip cover" by sewing two towels together at the ends, longwise. then fold one end over about a foot and sew sides together and put on car/ office seats. Make sure the colors will work together and not clash with the surrondings. Spray with fab.softner, and you should be zap free.Never but never spray fab. softner directly on leather of any varity trust me.

Common sense is what the prevailing mass of people call common sense.  Also, each culture has it's own common sense so there it breaks down even more.. . On the lighter side, I know many people in the US who are without the american version of common sense, who tend to have other qualities that make up for their non-common senseness.  So, just because someone appears stupid, they might be really smart on something else.

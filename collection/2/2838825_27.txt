There are 635 laws that were written in Leviticus and Deuteronomy in detailing the explanations of  what are there in the Major Ten Commandments. One of which specifically mentioned about God command against a man who sleeps with another man as if he sleeps with his wife and must be put to death. There are no contradictions in the Old Law but the New Testament is really questionable and to further support your claim. God said that "a time will come when His New Covenant will be made written in everyone's heart and mind and no longer will a brother tell another to know thy God because they will all know me" so. The New Testament as we know is not yet from God but it is just about the life of Jesus and  the apostles wrote their books were based primarily on hearsays because they all ran away during Jesus punishments and their written works came back 65 years after Jesus death and the rest is history.

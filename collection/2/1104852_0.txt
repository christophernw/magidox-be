CEA is an antigen produced by some types of tumors, including some breast cancers. A blood test detects CEA, which indicates that tumors are present and active. In some cases of metastasized breast cancer, the CEA test helps determine whether the treatment is working. The CEA test is not useful for routine cancer-related check-ups.

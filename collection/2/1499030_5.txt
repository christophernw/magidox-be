Cut down on sugary and oily foods, make sure you wash well, keep well hydrated and to get rid of what you have, try some of the salicylic acid pads on the market or use an astringent. Witch hazel should work pretty darn well. Just remember, when using an astringent, all your pimples will come to a head before it makes it easier to get rid of them. This could be slightly painful for large zits and it will make them temporarily look worse, so choose a time to use it where you don't have to go out in public much for a few days.

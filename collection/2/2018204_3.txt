So take a 1-liter container and weigh it empty.. Then fill it with 1 liter of water and weigh it again.. Take the difference and that's the weight of 1 liter of water.. Then convert to grams, ounces, whatever.. The values are approximations mind you, if you need closer then you have to consider factors such as density, temp, etc., of the water... as well as taking into account any impurities.  This doesn't sound like that's the case in this instance though.

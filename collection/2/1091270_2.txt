What's all this about?. What are you looking for?. What are you looking at?. I can't sort this out!. . I think you can end a sentence with a preposition.  You are told that you cannot because of the speech.  If it is formal speech it is usually recommended to avoid finishing your sentences with prepositions, yet when it is informal speech then you'll find them at the end.. . Now.... . There are two 'typical' formulas:. . SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT OF VERB + COMPLEMENT . . and. . SUBJECT + VERB + PREPOSITION + OBJECT OF PREPOSITION + COMPLEMENT. . Eg. I look at your question so that I can help you.. . Notice that I don't say "I look at".... It is expected that the speaker or writer makes reference to what is being looked at...  You need an OBJECT.. . This is why you are told not to finish with a preposition but yes you CAN.

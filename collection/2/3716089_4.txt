It's reminiscent of the old tradition of burning people on a pyre so that their soul can escape the body and make it to the after life.. . It's actually a pagan ritual, and when Christianity became mainstream it was ruthlessly squashed like everything else in non christian religions.  The people in trying to retain some of their beliefs without letting the christian rulers know that they were lit candles for the dead so that the soul could find the light and reach the afterlife.  People now do it because their parents did it, but they try to make up their own reasons for it.

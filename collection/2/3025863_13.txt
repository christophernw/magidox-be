Vicodin is a mixture of pain relief. Its most likely 750/7.5 mg which is 750 mg of non narcotic analgesic (acetaminophen or Tylenol) and 7.5 mg of narcotic pain reliever (hydrocodone) its a opioid agonist. It binds at opiate receptor sites in the central nervous system. So if a person is in real pain it works like its supposed to. If person takes this med for recreational use it makes them "high".

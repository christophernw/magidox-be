Clean the inside of your car and get all the little crumbs of food out.  You can buy some little green soft paraffin looking blocks to place in your trunk.  The mice will eat it and then die and hopefully not in your car.  You obviously have a hole somewhere that can are getting into.  Keep you windows up in your car at night. You could buy some of those sticky glue traps but you would have to be the one to dump the mouse.  . .  Yuk.  How awful for you.

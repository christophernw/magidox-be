I have always had a condition called amblyopia, which is a lazy eye.  The other one can be pulled in to 20/20, but without corrective lenses it is like I don't even see out of it. My good eye has deteriorated considerably in about the last ten years. I am now 49, and before too much longer I will probably have to rely on the lazy eye and lenses. I hope I can get lasik done on it so I can see normally again. I have to either wear my glasses now or hold stuff way far away to see it well. I HATE it, and I hate wearing glasses....when I was a kid I used to have to wear glasses and a patch on weekends to try and make the other eye work. I was always falling off my bike and getting all busted up and stung by bees, because with only one eye you have no depth perception. Your over all vision will deteriorate over time because the eye that works gets worn out from doing it all......

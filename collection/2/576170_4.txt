Well unlike all above i do understand what you mean and sort of agree.. . There is an element of complacency in relationships and the  grass does look greener on the other side making someone elses partner seem better than your own.. As an outsider you wouldn't know all the problems or annoying habits someone has, and maybe women are just a bit more blinkered than men to what they see.. . Husbands/boyfriends are an easy target, women talk to each other about relationships much more then men so i'm sure all her girlfriends will know of every chink in your armour.. . I'm not sure putting them forward is the right discription of what's happening, 'seeing other men in a more favourable light' is a bit closer to it.

If your family said stuff about you, that's messed up.  No disrespect, but if they really love u, they'll get u help.  Get help, it's not healthy.  I've wanted to(even though im a guy), i just listen to music and call my friends.  Make your life better, u can, just u have to try.  And if u end up getting your feelings hurt from taking my advice, don't hurt yourself doing it again.  Plz, listen to me.

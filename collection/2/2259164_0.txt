Sorry but I dont have the answer :(.  But I was wondering that too. I have sims 2 on gamecube and they never ask to have a baby.. If they made it without that option then I think they made a big boo boo. . Sorry that I couldn't aswer that question for you. but if you find out can you let me know? I would appreciate that

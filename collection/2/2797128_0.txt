both are very real. the holocaust was hitlers way of gettin rid of people of jewish faith.idealisticly hitler wanted a superior race,blonde haired blue, eyed men and women possibly under the age of 35.he was a satanic man and had the urged to rule the world.he started in the german army as a corporal but,rose to the top leader of nazi germany.he executed the jewish people simply because they were and are GODs chosen people according to the old testament {KJV}. im a christian and i have my own opinions and understandings which i wont go into now, but, hitler was not a godly man and since he did not beleive in GOD, i figure he didnt want anyone else to.now palestine is a country and a arab one at that.they are like their sister countries.always fighting about something and always in a state of unrest.arab nations have fought with each other or against each other for centuries and will till the end of time.i never understood the arabs really until i could halfway understand thecivil war.father against son,brother against brother.i know nothing of the term Palestine Murderer. could be the killing of a person or people or of the country.just my  simple understanding

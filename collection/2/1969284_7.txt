They didn't have immigration laws back then.  The first native Americans that met the settlers liked and helped them.  Other tribes weren't so nice on the intrusion of their land,(the territory they were aware of and hunted in etc) even if it was other Native Americans.  You act like like they had maps and all abided by the same rules and cultural practices and met once a year to toke the peace pipe and compare notes.

God created the heavens and the earth, and so on and so forth then created ADAM AND EVE. Now, there are 2 tree's - tree of life and tree of good and evil. Keep in mind we are talking about a God that created everything perfect in the beggining and COMPLETE. God knows WHAT good and EVIL is, however with 'Satan' DECIEVING eve while ADAM WAS PRESENT, sin (not listening to Gods word aka his commandment not to eat of the fruit) entered the WORLD through adam and eve knowing of both GOOD AND EVIL. . With that being said, adam was perfect in the beggining. Sin entered the world and ENTROPY (LAW OF ENTROPY) has taken place; the GROUND we live on HAS BEEN cursed. We as adam decendents were seperated from GODS Spirit because of this and that seperation permanent death from out god. . This life is NOT LINEAR BUT CICLICAL (circular) evidence but just about everything in NATURE. He plans for us to follow him and REDEEM US. God's PLAN AS STATED COUNTLESS TIMES IN THE BIBLE is to choose the TREE of LIFE and (HIS WORD AND COMMANDENTS) and to come back to his SPIRIT so we do not die with eternal seperation from God. . . God is the only 'being' if you will that creates. Man can only form and shape and mold of what is present in his environment. . . TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION: God created us because it was pleasing and good to him, life and obiedance is good to god! everything was perfect and complete - good in his eyes until sin entered in the world. (Read Genesis carefully and read this evidence) God already knows the end as from the beggining as stated in the bible. I don't know if you have children, but it's my personal opinion and observation that it works like this. I know what is good and what is bad for my daughter, I know that drinking hazardeous cleaning goods is bad. Perhaps it was the same way with sin. Sin = no life. If you kill someone that person dies. If you steal then someone else goes without and the act only leads to an eventual downfall, so on and so forth.. . I could go on and on about this subject but im getting tired of writing and trying to stay awake. I hope I touched some part of this subject. Thanks!!!

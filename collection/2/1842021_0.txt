When you exit, you're walking thru a sensitive receiving antenna array tuned to a specific frequency which is produced by a tiny metallic strip hidden somewhere in the item(s) in question. There are actually 2 metallic strips, 1 that will produce the required frequency, and 1 that is a flat metal plane that when pressed against the other strip will prevent it from being detected. A powerful magnetic device is used to slam the 2 strips together at checkout, deactivating the device.

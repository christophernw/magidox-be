The current government has decided three things:. . 1. The American way is the "moral right" of everyone on the planet, and as such they have the responsibility to export it to countries where the governments don't do it "our" way. (Of course, they will only bother if the country who is to be the recipient of our benificence has something we want, like oil.) The Sudan/Darfur doesn't get the same treatment, you'll notice.. . 2. Anytime another government disagrees with the US, we have the right to go kick their butts, and say it's to prevent them from trying to hit us first. This is called a "preemptive strike." So, if this logic follows, any other country who believes the US is going to come after them has every right to attack the US' interests first. Unfortunately the present administration doesn't see that this arguement follows logically.. . 3. Anytime the present administration "decides" it is right, anyone who disagrees with them is either a treasonous peasant, or actually a part of the enemy. As such, they can kill you or jail you without due process if they choose, because they are right, and YOU are wrong..... . We are at war because we are upholding Bush's, I mean, the US' right, to the above. Got it?

How can anything be positive when the war never went as planned? . No WMDs.. No WMD production plants. . No ties to the 9.11 terrorists attacks. . No ties to Osama bin Laden. . And the war was suppose to be a cakewalk with a price tag of maybe a few billion: WRONG! It has now became a costly, enduring and bogged down war leaving thousands of American GIs dead and tens of thousands of Iraqis dead. The public wasn't told about the possiblity of insurgency, civil war nor strife by politicans or the media (which was largely pro-war.) . So now that we are in Iraq and nothing has gone to plan...how can there be anything positive? We didn't invade Iraq to rebuild the very nation we bombed and sanctioned for more then decade but to disarm Saddam of WMDs he didn't even HAVE!

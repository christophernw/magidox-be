If all you want a manual switch then a 'single pole, single throw' (SPST) switch will work, they are similar to light switches, or you can get push buttons.  Ask at your local electronics / hobby store.. . You can also do some other fancy stuff by using some transistors and other various goodies.  You can make or a circuit the turns on/ off by some other external stimuli, such as touch switches.. . But from your description you should just purchase a simple switch from Radio Shack.

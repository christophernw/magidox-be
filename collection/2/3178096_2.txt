I totally agree with you. It does not make any sense at all because when I talk to people and say something about people sleeping together everyone always assumes they had sex which was not what I meant at all. I think it just became a more polite way for adults in particular to say having sex because first of all they usually sleep together after the sex and second of all I think it became common when woman wanted to tell their friends about their aquintences and leave out all the details. It just a casual way to say having sex I guess.

A proposed law is one that is not yet made law and placed before Parliament for consideration.  For it to be made law it must first of all conform to the restrictions of the Constitution of the country concerned.  In a Westminster system of government the law must be passed first by the lower house of Parliament then also passed by the Senate the upper house.  For that law to be implemented it must be Gazetted, that is published in the Government Gazette.  In practice that law is tested through the Courts to determine the validity of it as compared to the Constitution.  The Parliament is prone to make laws that do not comply with the Constitution because they are influenced in a manner by Foreign Treaties, and world adopted laws i.e.(human rights etc.)  However the Constitution has the overriding effect in law.

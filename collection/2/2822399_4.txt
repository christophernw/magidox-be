My thoughts and experience:. . Your perspective attracts to you others with similar thoughts and ideas...so along with that comes situations that reflect those thoughts and if you are a negative person you get stuck in the "Muck of life".. . The funny thing is though...you may not think of yourself as a bad person, but then you have to ask yourself this question:. . "Compared to whom?". . Ted Bundy or Princess Di?. . You could be deluding yourself that you are good, that you think positive thoughts and do little acts of kindness...but you could actually be a smuck.. . And smucks get stuck in muck.  . . Light attracts light...evil attracts evil.  So, if your view of the world is life is unfair...then you will get more of it.. . I will help you out a little...extend a hand to you, and would give you some advice.. . A few days ago I was upset about something going on with me, and my anger clouded my thoughts.  Not only that but I was in a city bus going to work, and traffic was slow.  I was getting pretty impatient.  . . Then he came on board.  He was dirty, in a wheelchair because he did not have any legs.  I looked at his hands and they were deformed...only two fingers.  Then I looked at his face...he was smiling.  Everyone on the bus knew him, they were saying, "Hello, John!" and he was smiling back at them.. . It made me think that my situations were not as bad as his, and here he was with a positive attitude.  My feelings about him was that he was homeless, he had a donation cup attached to his wheelchair, when I exited the bus, I put some money into his cup.. . This experience changed my views of my life.  It put perspective on my blessings instead of what I was lacking.. . I said a prayer to God to forgive me of my fullishness.. . Good luck to you my friend,  I hope things turn around for you like they did for me.

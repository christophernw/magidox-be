sounds like you have low sugar, i.e., hyper (hypo? not sure)glycemia possibly.  Normal fasting glucose is 70-90, up to 110 even.  After you eat it should be somewhere around 150 ish give or take a few points.  So you should start eating smaller meals more often throughout the day and when you get a headache don't eat something with a ton of sugar in it but rather something with just a few carbs, i.e., not candy or cakes but maybe a glass of milk or a piece of bread with cheese on it, etc.  Taking your glucose with a monitor is good because it will help you to know where your good points and bad points are through the day.  If you can control your glucose with diet you are much better off - otherwise it will be a lifetime of medication and/or injections.

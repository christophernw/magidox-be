most books have pre test in them if not you could do as i and make study cards of all the inportant stuff not a realy fun way but hay it works for me . and my fave is this set down go thru the book and try and see if you can make the test make up questions you think are likly to be on the test and be fair just cause you dont think you might not know one put it in there any ways and make sure there good questions the hader the questions that you know and can answer the easer the test may be yours trully lone

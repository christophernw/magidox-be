Still in school, no military service, huh?. Try never to be in a fair fight. It matters less to you that you've won if you're dead. After five years in Iraq, we've had fewer soldiers killed than in a good HOUR at Shiloh or Antietam. In WW II our we were criticized by our allies; the Brits or the Free French would lose a section of men trying to clear Germans from a cathedral. The U.S. would send in a couple dozen 155 rounds from a good safe few miles away. Our military doctrine is to use technology and destroy the inanimate (along with our enemies) to limit our casualties. This has been modified of late to our troops' peril. But we still want to give our troops the best advantages we can.

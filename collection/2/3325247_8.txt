Try some calamine lotion, or maybe just chapstick.  Now that youve ripped all the hair off,  your skin and lips are completely unprotected against the wind and stuff, esspecially since its cold out.  (At least where I am.)  Have you gotten you face wet recently?  Cuz that can rly cause it to dry out.

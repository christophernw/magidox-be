It isn't necessarily becoming more widespread. We just hear about it more so now. It is entirely possible that there were more acts of pedophilia in the past and the vast majority of them were never brought out into the public arena similar to Michael Jackson.. . Personally I'd guess that it is happening either at the same rate or a slightly lower rate than before.

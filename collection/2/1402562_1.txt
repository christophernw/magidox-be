More and more departments are requiring college hours so I would highly recommend getting a bachelors degree first. Also, being a firefighter is a dangerous job. It comes with the territory. You will be injured in your career, probably more than once. Hopefully the injuries will not be serious, but they could be career ending. A firefighter that has had a career ending injury is not really qualified to do anything else. If you have a bachelors degree then you have something to fall back on. . . To become a firefighter you typically need to go to a fire academy and become a certified firefighter. Most departments will also require that you be at least an EMT-Basic, so you will also need to go to EMT school. Fire acadmey is normally about 12 weeks, and EMT-B school is about the same. Some departments will hire you off the street with no certification, but most will require that you already be certified. Some departments will also require that you be a paramedic. To become a paramedic, you must first finish EMT-B school, and then you go to paramedic school. Paramedic school is normally about 12 - 18 months, and it is VERY difficult. You have to study hard and work hard, but it is worth it. In my area when a department tests that requires no certifications, they will have about 2,500 people test for 10 positions. When a department requires firefighter and EMT-B, they will have about 500 people test for 10 positions. When a department that requires paramedics only tests, they will have 50-100 people test for 10 positions. Obviously as a medic, your odds are MUCH better. I can't recommend enough that you become a medic first.

In a nutshell, the purpose of yoga is to improve your flexibility, your posture, and your mind. You also learn proper breathing techniques, like breathing through your diaphragm (not the shallow breathing that most of us do). You can also meditate to clear your mind of negative thoughts and stresses of the day. There are many types of yoga...some more relaxing, some strenuous, some use heat.

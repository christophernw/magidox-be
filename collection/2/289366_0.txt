Best advice I've been given is to get experience, either by doing work at smaller mags, or for internet sites - get a good list going and work up.. . Keep reading mags, have a go at all kinds of writing to keep your english up to scratch, and write reviews for games, either to submit later, or just for fun.. . Enjoy yourself, and GOOD LUCK

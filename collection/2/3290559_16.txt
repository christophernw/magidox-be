I agree with the above,  The plan they keep talking about having.  It sure sounds great that you "have a plan" but someday I sure would like to hear what that plan is.  Unlike Jack Murtha today saying"we just need to figure out what to do about all this"  "all this" must not be what the plan was about.  I wouldnt know though I havent heard "that plan yet"

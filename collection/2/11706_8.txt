Listen to Me, my son! I know what I am saying; LISTEN! Watch yourself lest you you be indiscreet and betray some vital information. For the lips of a prostitute are sweet as honey, and smooth flattery is her stock in trade. But afterwards only a bitter conscience is left to you, sharp as a double-edged sword. She leads you down to death and hell. For she does not know the path to life. She staggers down a crooked trail, and doesn't even realize where it leads.. Young men, listen to Me, and never forget what I'm about to say: RUN FROM HER! DON'T GO NEAR HER HOUSE, lest you fall to her temptation and lose your honor, and give the remainder of your life to the cruel and merciless; lest strangers obtain your wealth, and you become a slave to foreigners. Lest afterwards you groan in anguish and shame, when syphilis consumes your body, and you say," Oh, if only I would have listened! If only I had not demanded my own way! Oh, why wouldn't I take advice? Why was I so stupid? For now I must face public disgrace." . Drink water from your own well, my son-- be faithful and true to your wife. Why should you beget children with women of the street? Why share children with those outside your home? Let your manhood be a blessing; rejoice in the wife of your youth. Let her charms and tender embrace satisfy you. Let her love alone fill you with delight. Why delight yourself with prostitutes, embracing what isn't yours? FOR GOD IS CLOSELY WATCHING YOU, and He weighs carefully everything you do.

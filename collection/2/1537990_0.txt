People like the look of clean blue water...reminds them of the ocean off Hawaii or a clean mountain stream.. . I think if the cleaner made the water a lovely shade of brown, or green, or black, folks would be more focused on WHAT is currently in the water, as opposed to why they are there in the first place.. . I have seen yellow toilet cleaner...but have never purchased it.

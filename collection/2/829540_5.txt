Listen, just because leiberman didnt get the party support for the nomination doesnt mean he's going to act like a baby and switch parties.  By all accounts he's a democrat, the only reason he's running independent is because he can afford it and the Dems wouldnt let him run for president.  My guess is you would never have to worry about something like that from Joe Lieberman.  Sounds like something that you would see from that Barak Obama character.

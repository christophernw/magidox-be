Natures Miracle hands down!!!  It's like...the heavenly product for pet owners!!!  Before my cat died last month, he was peeing everywhere...we used an entire bottle of Natures Miracle and it worked WONDERS!!  Now, they have it in a laundry detergent too!!  We're planning on using that for the towels used to soak up the pee...

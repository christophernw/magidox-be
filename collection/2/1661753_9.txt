If they were dirty words, I'm sure Yahoo Answers would asterisk them out.  . . That said, I'm liberal on most subjects and conservatism in general ooks me out.  I can't get behind the ideology that things were better back in some mythical "good ol' days" and that rich people should be supported by a non-interfering government.  I hate the things that have happened under conservative governments and the whole idea seems pretty dirty to me.. . What children are you talking to?  Are you typing while driving, kids kicking the back of your seat?  Did you suddenly lapse into a fantasy world?  Huh?

I believe it is a balance.  Video games (especially as advanced as today's games are becoming) can improve hand-eye coordination (action), strategy and thinking skills (RPG or Role-Playing-Games), and also the ability to reason (puzzle games and such).  Playing video games can be good for kids in that it can be a social situation (multiplayer interaction), but can also be bad depending on the mood of the children involved, which can lead to fighting and violence.  It is important to make sure that kids only play video games that they are mature enough to handle, which is made easier on the parents by the ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board).

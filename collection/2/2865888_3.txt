Republicans care about themselves and enrichment of themselves ONLY.  They are the party of property and money.. . Democrats care about all people.  They care about humanity no matter who they are.  Rich, poor, Black, Brown, White.  . . Republicans say: "I got mine...now get yours the best way you can...". . Democrats say: "We're all in this together".   . . THOSE are the fundamental differences between the two parties.

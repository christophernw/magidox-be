I think it is the "holier than thou" attitude. They have habits that I don't like either...drinking and driving, too much perfume,etc....So, if they don't like me smoking they can just stay away from me. I always get WAY away from non-smokers when I smoke because I know it bothers them. If that isn't good enough....sorry....

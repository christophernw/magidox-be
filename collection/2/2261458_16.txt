Don't rush into getting a new pet -- it wouldn't be fair to either you or the new pet.  Another bird cannot replace the one you lost; it would be a new pet, with a new personality.  Simply because it wasn't the bird you lost, it would likely be a disappointment to you.  Wait until you've healed a bit.  When you are willing to start a relationship with a new friend, THEN start your search for a new pet.

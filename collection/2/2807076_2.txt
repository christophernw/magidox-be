Place it an electromagnet. Actually, assuming that the field is strong enough, that would make it implode.. . So, a better idea is subject it to a rapid change in temperature - i.e. either heating it up or cooling it down. Both produce massive pressure changes which would easily cause the can to "blow".. . Although, technically, when you cause the can to blow by cooling it down, you're actually causing it to implode. But the effect looks almost identical.

yeah... i too lost a friend in just a flash and i know how you feel. it's okay for you to cry on it. but you have to remember that he is happy on wherever he is now and it will make him feel bad if you would not get over his 'leaving.' just hold on to the memories you had together, put it in the pass, and look at the brighter future. hey, you might even find someone who's almost as good as him. hope i helped. =)

If you are a U.S. Citizen, look on the Department of State website. You can download the form, print it, and you need the required photo and your birth certificate. Make an appointment at your local post office. Be sure and bring the correct payment with you.. . If you are NOT a U.S. Citizen, you have to wait till you become one. But when you go to your citizenship swearing-in ceremony, they should have a table/booth  where you can apply for a passport.

Well that really is the problem with atheism.  It provides no objective foundation for morality whatsoever.  Any atheist Ive ever talked to on this subject at length eventually admits that he believes that morality is subjective because the bottom line is they are forced to say that morality comes from humans and not a transcendent being.  If morality comes from humans then there is nothing objective about it!. . If I tell you that an apple is red, grows on trees, is a type of fruit, and grown in Washington, Ive told you a set of objective statements about an apple.  These have nothing to do with how I personally feel about apples nor did I have a hand in determining these facts.  Now if I tell you I dont like eating apples but my brother does, I didnt really tell you anything about apples, only about me and my brother.   . . So invariably any answer you get from atheists is going to be just that, SUBJECTIVE.  They will say "well I believe doing this is good for this reason" and "well I dont believe in that so much."  A subjective moral point of view tells you so much about the person but it doesnt tell you squat about morality itself nor clearly objectively defines what is RIGHT or WRONG.  Therefore what Hitler did wasnt WRONG, you just happen to disagree with it!

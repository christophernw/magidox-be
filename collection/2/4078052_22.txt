Never was for me...I used it in baseball and soccer and teams hated to go up against me..so i guess it was bad luck for them...but I hit over .400 and I was a defenseman in soccer and didn't allow a goal all season....it worked great for me!. . That said, try and find a 13th floor at a hotel..it is bad luck for those who are superstitious...which includes most athletes...or in my case...their oppponents..

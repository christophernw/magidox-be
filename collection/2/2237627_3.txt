Gamecube caters to more of a younger generation. With the exception of Resident Evil, most of the games on the Gamecube are childish (Mario Party, Super Monkey Ball etc..). I agree with you that the graphics are just as good, but its game lineup lacks what the PS2 and Xbox delivers to the older and more prominent generation of gamers. In light of these facts, Nintendo needs to lower the prices on the system in hopes to sell more of them and compete with sony and microsoft.

a good question!!. well Islam is not the religion of terrorism and i must admit that Muslims did a very bad thing by protesting against i don't say protest is bad but protest in a way that there mustn't be any death or any causalities around protesting against Denmark didn't effect the Denmark as it affects the Muslims countries where the protests held..they(Muslims) encountered a lot of death causalities by the protesting its only the Imams who protest these things and give a wrong view to the innocent Muslims that if u don't protest u r a non-Muslim i wanna ask Muslims they are always doing bad deeds against Islam but wen it comes to some thing like cartoons or what so ever they protest in a such a ruide way that a lot of causalities occur. i wanna say in the last there a lot of facts about Muhammad)PB UH) are there explained in the Holy Quran that He suffered a lot form non-muslims of that ERA but He didnt wish for any death causilites from them infact God(Allah) ask Him much to wish for any casulities but He refused.. The only thing is that muslims are not following their religion completly they only follow the Islamic points which are an easy task for them.

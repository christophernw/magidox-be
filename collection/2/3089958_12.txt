Buy baby new potatoes (red or white or combo); scrub clean (don't peel), preheat oven to 425 degrees; combine potatoes in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil just to coat, salt (I prefer Kosher, but regular OK), fresh ground pepper, and a few sprinkles of Mrs Dash (has parsley, garlic, rosemary, thyme); pop onto a baking sheet for about 20-30 minutes, turning 1/2 way. Yummy!

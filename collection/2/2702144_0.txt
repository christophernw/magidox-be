What I think he is after is a certified copy of your final DD 214 you received during out processing. If you don't have it, you will have to apply to your branch PERSCOM for another copy (which could take some time). A good starting point is the National Personne Records Center in St. Louis, MO. I have linked their site for info on how to get a copy of these records below.

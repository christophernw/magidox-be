it could be a bad fuse or relay switch. go back to autozone and look in there auto manuals for your car. there's a section for trouble shooting, thing's to check, and they'll show you how to check. but some of this will require a digital multimeter. electrical parts can quit with no warning. could also be egnition switch getting old an not making a good connection. good luck hope this helps.

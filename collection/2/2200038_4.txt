My aunt always used to tell me to stand on the opposite foot and jump up and down tilting your head so the water will fall down. It worked when I was little, but now that I am older and know more..  This is a better solution--  Use some rubbing alcohol.  Pour a little bit into the cap, tilt your head, and pour in a few drops, so that you can feel it fill the ear canal.  The alcohol will mix with the water, and it won't create a seal like water will.  Give it a couple seconds, then tilt back using a tissue to wipe away any leftover water/alcohol

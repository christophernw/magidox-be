The reason why you can't get this person to notice you is just one of the many things you have written about below your main question. I an still in your shoes I'm not too heavy. But  form passed experience  men look at your body first and then if they like what they see they make their move, those kind of guys don't really want any thing more than a one night stand and then they never call or see you again, if you would pursue this guy I know that he will react in the matter I have just described. I'd be very careful of guys who are way to friendly they re only after one thing and I know that you know this too. Or the man is just not interested in you no matter how hard you try, he will never see you in the way you want him to. Move on there other men out there that would like you very much just keep looking and when you leats expect it that is when you will find your true love.

Remember they are all just people.  Remind yourself that you are qualified for the job (that's why you're in the chair).. . Take your time answering the questions (just be sure to offer some acknowledgment that you heard the what was said).. . Remember, most of the people you have or will work with in your life are not a perfect fit for the position.  The potential employer is listing a wish-list.. . Feel free to say something negative about yourself!  Just put a positive spin on it by telling everyone how you learned or grew from the experience.. . Don't sell your self short.  Tell them what you would like to do for them.  Even if it dose not involve the position you are currently applying for it will help make your interviews feel like you plan on sticking around.. . Another trick I use is I speak like I am already on and apart of the team.  That helps because then the interview just becomes a team meeting about me (a topic I'm well prepared to discuss).. . I don't suggest using the "picture everyone in their underwear", you wouldn't want to start laughing like a loon.. . Hope this helps.. . OH and DON'T FORGET TO PRACTICE!

I think you'll find that most adults who do not have children are not very understanding and don't seem to remember what it was like to be a kid.  Maybe your questions are too immature, or maybe you're just taking them to heart too much.  All these answers must be taken with a grain of salt and just ingore the ones you dont want to hear.

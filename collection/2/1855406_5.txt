It was sooo funny...first....illegals and their supporters many on here were cheering it on...praising the whole idea....then after illegal Mexicans and their supporters (many of whom post here) started to see that America did not like the new version they pointed their fingers at the UK saying that it was recorded there...and now a few weeks later i don't hear any Mexicans praising the new version. They praised it that is why they got "blamed" and rightfully so.

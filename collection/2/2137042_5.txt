Simple. . . In my experience speaking with christians, the majority of them are not comfortable with their beliefs. They know deep down, there is no substance to them. They will not actively consider their beliefs because this can cause them to quickly unravel.. . As such, they get frustrated that the answer "just have faith" is not enough for a person who actually wants reasons to believe in something, so they become hostile and usually revert to threats of hell-fire.

It tells us that Jesus is trying to bring us to Him and He is waiting for us to realize how foolish it is to try and live without Him. There are rewards for obeying Jesus.  One did and was not understanding why the son who returned was treated so well. There are Jews who have accepted Jesus as Messiah but they do not get anything more than Christians who have come to Jesus. Our Savior loves in spite of our sins. He is waiting for us to come to Him. He will forgive us and take us back.

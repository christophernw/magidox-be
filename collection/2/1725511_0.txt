This will only work with silver dollars - it is not possible with paper money.. . For this you will need around 10,000 US silver dollars.  Heat the dollars up to around 4,000 degrees centigrade, then pour into a small clay pit.. . You will then have a small pond, but unless you have a means of maintaining the temperature it will soon set.. . Ond DO NOT put goldfish in it - they will die.

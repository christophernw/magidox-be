When you join the military you get so much GI bill in your contract between 18k and 35k for your first 12 months in service you give $100 dollars each month. You can use that money while in the military or when you get out for full time school. but it is given to you in increments unless you sign of for a technical course they will give you a lump sum. but the payments are around 1000 a month.

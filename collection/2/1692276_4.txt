Good story.. . Sacrifice is giving something that you don't have to give, for another. Giving my rent money to the single lady down the street because she has no money to feed her kids, using my time to volunteer even though I have better things to do. But ultimately, sacrifice would be laying my life down to save another.. . Jesus made the ultimate sacrifice. And so many people ignore it, it means nothing to them, even though he did it for them just as he did it for you and I. Kinda sad now that you think of it, huh?

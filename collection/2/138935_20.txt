Canker sores are essentially cold sores that appear inside the mouth, rather than on the lips, or outside the mouth. Once you're infected with the virus that causes them (it's Herpes, by the way, but not the STD version--it's transmitted by kissing or by cold sores that infect your mouth) you're stuck with it for life. The best treatment is one prescribed by a doctor. There are prescription medications for canker sores, and I have been using one for mine for a few years now. After awhile, it seems to keep the virus that causes canker sores at bay. I don't have them too much anymore, after using prescription treatment for a year or two.

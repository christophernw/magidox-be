I think sometimes white people tend to be uptight because everything is focused on the minority population.  They are often criticized for things that the ancestors did and had no control over.  How do they correct it?  Why are they overlooked for certain scholarships or jobs because of their color...it is reverse discrimination.  I know this is what has been happening to people of color for years, but two wrongs don't make a right.  What really is the answer to solve all the negetivity?  We should all just try to get along.  Accept each other for what is inside and not what we look like on the outside.

For carpet, pour a pet odor neutralizer such as Urine Gone on the spot - enough to saturate into the carpet pad.

For walls or other hard items, dip a paper towel in water and then dip in dry baking soda, it makes a crumbly paste - use it to scrub the yellow stain off and it takes the smell off as well. . . For clothes, put in the washer and use the new Febreze Downy.   Iâ€™ve noticed that sometimes the smell stays if you only use regular detergent.. . For wicker baskets or other items that are difficult to clean, you may have to throw it away or try spraying an odor neutralizer on it.

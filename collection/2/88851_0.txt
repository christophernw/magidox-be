They are supposed to verify the signatures when you use a credit card or a debit card, usually just a quick glance to see if the signatures match. And I believe that by law, only the cardholder is supposed to be able to use it. I worked at a place where we were not allowed to accept a credit card from anyone except the card holder (like, if the card had a man's name, and a woman saying she was his wife was using it, we could not accept it).  Not all stores bother to do that though.

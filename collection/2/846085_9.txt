When you get the answer please let me know... this has been bothering me for years!!!  You would think that someone from the hotdog place would get in touch with someone from the bun place and say, hey, we've been selling our dogs in packs of 12 like forever now, so can you get with the program?  It's all a big conspiracy.  My bet is that the bun people are trying to keep their stock strong by selling us those two extra buns in every pack that eventually go to waste if we can't con our kids into eating funny looking peanutbutter and jelly sandwiches!

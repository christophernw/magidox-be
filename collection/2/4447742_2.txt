I think some people just like the interactivity of this site.  Sure they could search for some of the answers online.  In some cases they may be overwhelmed by the number of sites an online search brings up.  This happens when the search terms are too broad.. It seems like a lot of the questions are seeking opinions rather than facts.  This question/answer set up fits well for that.

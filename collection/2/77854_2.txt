I'm not sure where you got the impression that the Swiss Guards are not "their own people."  . . Every member of the Swiss Guard is, and always has been, Catholic.. . One of the requirements of the Guard is that they be Catholic men in good standing.. . And yes, they really are Swiss. . . All Swiss men are required to perform military service for life; all able-bodied men in Switzerland are formally members of that country's army.. . As such, it has the greatest pool of eligible Catholic soldiers to draw from.. . The Guard are not just there for decoration or ceremony.  All of them are not only Swiss soldiers, but specially trained Swiss soldiers.  All of them are experts in martial arts, hand-to-hand combat, all types of conventional military weapons, and so on.

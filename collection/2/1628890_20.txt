I find them irritating. They stuff pamphlets under my apartment door, and that's actually the tamer side of them. I have a friend who had Jehovah's Witnesses at his door, and when he told them he wasn't interested and tried to close the door, one tried to get a foot in the way so he couldn't close it.

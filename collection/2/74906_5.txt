Ive had various sizes , 25 mcg, 50 mcg and  100 mcg, It depends how far off your natural thyroid hormones are. For example, I have a dosage of 225 mcg per day.  2x100 and 1x 25 mcg.. . As long as you have this checked annually, you should be well monitored.  Any changes to medication will require another 3 month adjustment period then more blood.. . LOL.. you will soon call them vampires like i do...

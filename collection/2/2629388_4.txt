In Genesis 8, Noah offered up sacrifices to God.  He could do that because he had brought some animals aboard the ark in larger groups than twos (Genesis 7:2).  Then in Genesis 9, God put the fear of man in the heart of every animal, so that they would be hard to catch, and then He said to Noah that they were to be food for him as well as the plants.  Apparently there was enough time for the animals to reproduce because we've been eating them for centuries, and we still have enough to eat.

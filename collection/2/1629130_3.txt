h20 is actually at it's greatest density at 3.98 degrees celcius, it has an open hexoganal strucure and is held rigidly by the hydrogen bonds (the strongest possible covalent bonds) the volume goes down until it hits 3.98 then begins to go up because of the "open space" between the molecules in the open hexoganal structure.

Birds are like children they need love, affection, attention.  Take your bird out and play with him daily.  Change his water dish at least once a day.   He might need a bath.  My birds go in the shower with me and take baths in the sink.  But they sell bird baths that you can hook onto the cage.  Is the cage big enough? . . Heat will make a bird molt (lose feathers)  Budgies most definately need gravel to survive.   Don't give him sandpaper covered perches, those hurt the birds feet. GIve him fruits and veggies, bread, anything you eat except salty, fried, stuff or candy.  Never give your bird alcohol or milk.     . . My birds love it when I gently sand their beak with a nail file.  Birds like to chew on wood.  If you have any fruit trees around that were not sprayed with pesticides give him a small branch or buy some wooden bird toys so he can keep his beak sharp.

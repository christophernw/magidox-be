sigh. Osama attacked America. Osama was part of Alqaeda. Al Queda had a lot of people in both Afganistan and Iraq. We invaded Afganistan looking for terrorists. Iraq had terrorists. Iraq had wmds (supposedly). America invaded Iraq. Iraq's dictator is now overthrown. I dont think thats a problem? Yes, the reason is very vague for the invasion. But guess what. It happened. And thats not changing. . . And if anyone ever attacked us because of canadiens, i would kill them myself.

I have often wondered this myself...There are so many people that are so rich, they will never be able to spend all that money. Neither will their kids, or their kids' kids. Why can't we all be rationed the same amount of money and all live healthy, fortunate lives. Why are there people that suffer and live their lives on the streets...When there are people so rich, they stay in large homes and are waited on. It doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm sure the only people who do think it is fair, are the ones with so much money. Sorry, but I don't see this ever happening. Sadly enough, most people would rather let those on the streets die, than give them their "hard earned" money.

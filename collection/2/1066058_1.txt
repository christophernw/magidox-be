"To be a double edged sword, of being lazy and being bored.". ~ Relient K, MMHMM album, Double Edged Sword.. It shows that people will be lazy, but people are also bored. You can't fight boredom without doing something to get out of that funk. If you get one, the other is often right behind. Keeps me from becoming lazy, so I try to preoccupy my time as much as possible.

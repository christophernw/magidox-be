It is perfectly all right if you have slipped sometimes. I myself have slipped, fallen countless number of times, but the Lord of my heart tells me, "Pori Pori Uthi Thaka" which is Assamese for "Keep getting up each time you fall." A day will come when God who is noticing our struggle, will take us in His arms and then we will fall no longer. I believe to keep up the struggle to be good while admitting one's mistakes or faults is repentance. I have not succeeded in repenting myself so far but I feel that is the way. Regards.

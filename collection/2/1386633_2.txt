It's a way to blame women for all the evils of the world- like Pandora's box.  men see women as seductive agents of worldliness and/or weakness; this story just personifies the idea of sexual temptation while also illustrating the "inherent" weakness of the female nature.  . Don't worry- It is just a story- and it has been used to justify the maltreatment of females ever since some pothead wrote it down 4 thousand years ago.

It is when they have exhausted all your energy and you have lost that spark that made you so great at your job in the beginning. You now know what you are doing but you are doing it in zombie mode. If your boss said this has happened to you, then you should either take a vacation or start looking for a new job because chances are if you don't snap out of it soon you can bet they will find a replacement that is fresh and has a new attitude! Good-luck!

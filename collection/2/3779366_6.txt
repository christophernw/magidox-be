A Christian is a believer who has been baptized under water (just as Lord Jesus was), and born again into his blood and eternal life.  A Methodist is an adherent to a sect founded by a man named John Wesley some years back. Some Christian beliefs he chose to adhere to, while others he chose to ignore.  Make sure your beliefs and practices are in line with the scripture if you are going to profess to be a true Christian. God has called us to be Chritians ONLY!

Buy an audio interface.  Goto http://www.samash.com and call them 1-800-4-samash then ask them on the phone for pro audio.  Then be willing to buy a 200-1000 dollar interface.  You ask them for a 96kHz audio interface.  This speed should run about 400 dollars.  The faster the speed the better.  It can go upto 196kHz.  By the way you may also want to listen to audio on DVD's insted of audio CD's.   When an audio DVD comes from the manufactuer it is played at 96kHz.  A CD is only recorded at 44.1kHz.  MP3 Files and AAC files (iTunes files) are 44.1kHz also.  So don't expect good quality unless the file was recorded at a high sample rate.

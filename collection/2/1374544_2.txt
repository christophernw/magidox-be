Actually it matters who you talk to. But increasingly they are finding that it is the grapes (regardless of color) that are good for you, so whether it's wine or grape juice, red or white it's just as good for your heart and blood. Just try to stick to the ones that are "Organic" (no pesticides, etc) and have no sugar added if you really want to do it right!. Good luck!

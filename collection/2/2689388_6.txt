Why do non-liberals attack liberals personally rather than listening to what is said?  Why are non-liberals arguements so weak they must resort to calling their opponents "emotional"?. . I feel the sign of the truly intelligent American isn't that he fits his label or liberal or not, it's that he thinks for himself and does not follow his party like a sheep.

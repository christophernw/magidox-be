It's sounds to me like your the one whose offended about something.  I think, though, that you have the gods confused.  Satan is considered the god of this world and if anyone is to blame for turmoil, strife and bad weather he is.  He goes to and fro on this earth seeking whom he may devour.  So as long as we're alive in this world we will have the onslaught that Satan pours out.  Every good and perfect gift is from above.  Stop blaming God for what the enemy of our souls is doing.

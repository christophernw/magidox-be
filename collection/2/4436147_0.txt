Yes, it is possibile. Gravity is merely a force exerted by mass which draws more mass to itself. Everytthing exerts gravity (when your in the bath and a hair or something floats toward you on the water). However, with Quantum Theory and new breakthroughs in subatomic physics we are discovering particles which break ALL the rules, not just gravity.. As it stands gravity will only stop working if you invent an anti-gravity unit (my friends building one) or a mass greater than the earth moves close to the earth and we all get pulled to pieces off the planet.. Then there's Black Holes, a tear in spacetime where gravity is SO strong it tears itself.

Hunny it only makes you stronger if you let it, look at it as privelage! my childhood sounds pretty similar....it takes so much time to get over it, it's not easy, but not impossible either.... you're human..and life is not easy.... just know that you are who you are, and the miserable past will only make you more compassionate towards people in your life..... everyday is a new day... live life to the fullest, you will never live the same moment twice...can't spend it miserable...you will always be different from the most around you... but its no fun if we were all the same.... God is your real daddy, and husband.... he always loved you, and will continue to do so eternally!

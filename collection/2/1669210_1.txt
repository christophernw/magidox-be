I took a Critical Thinking Class. . . Are you with Axia Online or University of Phoenix? . Aaron Flanders Instructor? :D . . Anyway, Critical thinking is when you basically "pull things apart" and you reason and rationalize. One thing that I studied in Critical thinking is Television commercials. I had to think about what time I saw that type of commercial on, how often I saw it, I had to think about the graphics, what kind of audience I felt that the commercial was leaning towards because of the type of commercial, the people in the commercial, and so on. I had to think about the "jingles" that were used and the themes. . . It really is interesting. I hope that you enjoy the class. I hope that this information helps

There are many reasons we are in Iraq.First the peace accord from Desert Storm was broken by Iraq,also 17 resolutions from United Nations were ignored.Every intelligent agency,including the Russians said Iraq has WMD and they did,some were buried,some moved to Syria.The liberal media wont admit cause they like making USA look like a idiot,ur fathers and granfathers fought in WW1,WW2 and others to allow u to have the freedoms u have now,just think what would be if we had lost.Would u be speaking Japanese or German with no freedoms?Do u want to live in fear of terrorist?The radical muslims donot care about innocent lives,they think theirs is only religion and all others need to be exterminated.Sounds like Hitler and how many died before the world said was enough and defeated him.Wake up America,look at the consequences of doing nothing,u maynot be here tomorrow as a result.

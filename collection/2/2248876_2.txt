I'm afraid it's true, bud! Stop beating that meat and you'll get your wet dreams back!. Otherwise, try this: just before you go to sleep, think ONCE(this is the key, think it more than once and it won't work)of a sexual desire, situation or act you wish to dream about. Then completely forget it. I mean it! Think about something else quickly to stop you remembering what you just thought.(It's not easy, but who said it was going to be!? Consolation-it's not as hard as sexual abstinence!)Then just go to sleep. You will dream about the thought you put in your mind during the course of the night.. . Good luck and enjoy!

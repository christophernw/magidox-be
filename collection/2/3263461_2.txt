It has no logical reason dear. . In ancient egypt time was divided to 20 parts as I remember. there were civilization were it was divided to 8 or 9 and so many other numbers.. It's just like what happened with newton when he figured out a rainbow has 7 colors in it. He liked the number 7 because it's just the number of music notes.. I don't remember were exactly but I read somewhere about a civilization which divided time to 24 parts and it was based on astronomy.

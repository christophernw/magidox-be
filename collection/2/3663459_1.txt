the drugs are called immunosupperesants and they suppress the immune system because the immune system might recognize the organ as a foreign body and produce anti-bodies to destroy that organ. Before an organ transplant is done, they have to check fot tissue compatibility to see if the tissue cells of the donor and the receiver are close to similar to reduce the percentage of the body's rejection of the organ. the immunosuppresants have side effects such as depresion and because the body has a reduced immunity, they are more suseptible to aquire a disease or sickness of some sort. Most of the time, the patients are to be kept under tight watch under strelized conditions until the body accepts the organ and until they can stop taking immunosuppresants.. Good Luck!

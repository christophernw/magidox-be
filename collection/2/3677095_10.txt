While I'm not going to get into the debate on whether or not there is life on other planets, I'd like to point out that species of animals are only capable of so much adaptation.  When conditions become intolerable, a species can no longer adapt and suffers extinction.  Certainly, if one were to drop unprotected animals on the surface of the Moon, for eampel, I would expect that the harsh environmental conditions there would cause those animals to immediately die.

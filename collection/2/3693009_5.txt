It can be, every now and then I'll indulge in it too but try not to get too involved!  I don't buy the mags but I will read the ones that are passed around at work. Eh, for me, it's entertainment, they are glamorous, they have money!  It's kinda like make-believe!  And as the first answer said...normal people have somewhat boring lives sometimes!

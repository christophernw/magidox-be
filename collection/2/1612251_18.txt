The belief that "God" (if 'he' even exists, which I seriously doubt) is a "Man",  is the Judeo-Christian belief.  It's something dreamed up by the Rabbies and Preachers... in other words.. IT'S MAN MADE.  In some of the Eastern Religions, "God" is thought to be BOTH male AND female.. . he,he,he... I'll betcha' they didn't tell you THIS in Bible School.

Cracker is a phrase used by old black men and was coined in the south to refer to the "good ol boy" police force. They called them crackers because they only seemed to crack down on blacks and at that time in the south, the crime was simply living.. . Today, it is misused to just refer to white people in general as a racial epitet. The problem is the the phrase never held any real power and is largely in disuse. The guy sounds like a rude one.. . Btw, I see someone mentioned a white person calling another white person a cracker... I suggest you don't do this as it would cause all us black men to laugh until the cows come home. It really isn't a racial slur per se, it just evolved into one.

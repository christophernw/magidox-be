Well, I once had a summer job digging graves at Dallas' largest graveyard.  But when I learned I could make more money hauling garbage for the city, long before garbage bags were ever  heard of and heavy garbage cans were in vogue, well, I had to go up to the "higher money".  Sure got dirty and tired, but I also earned my way into college that way, and three degrees later, I'm happy I worked so hard.  Don't be afraid of work.  It'll do you good, as it does anyone and everyone.  God Bless you.

Because to open ourselves to accept miracles without questioning the why's and the how's of it would be to show TRUE FAITH.. . Most of us at some level are afraid of doing this coz we with our limited understanding of the true meaning of the universe think we ourselves are in control of our lives.. . If we were to embrace the belief that it is GOD who controls everything  and not us, even in the most mundane activities of our life and all our actions are his wishes  we will start accepting GOD as the ultimate truth and stop searching for what is really in front of our eyes.

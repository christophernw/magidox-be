I'm not the best person to answer as I am a practicing Catholic but I'm guessing you (or your parents) were raised in a Christian family and its just what you do in December.  Either that or you live in a Christian country and decided you didn't want to be left out.  Either way it is entirely up to you.  . . The beauty of a free society is that you are free to believe and celebrate whatever you like, as long as it doesn't cause offence or hurt to others (thats the Christian in me talking!) . . Whatever the reason feel free to enjoy yourself :)  For my part, as long as I'm at midnight Mass on Christmas Eve, I'll enjoy my Christmas.  This I know as I had to work last Christmas day and didn't feel like I missed out as I still had the most important part to me.. . Happy Christmas

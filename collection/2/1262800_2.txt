Hair on mammals, of course, is used as an insulator.  Since hair is hollow, it will keep the bear warm in the winter, and also protect from the sun and extreme heat in the summer.  The coloration of the hair assists in blending in with the bear's background as well.  Very thick hair can also protect the bear from injury during altercations with other animals, including other bears for territorial issues.

I don't think the answer is malpractice. There is such a discrepancy in standards of living that the Chinese can work for low wages (from our point of view) and still vastly improve their lives. Because the cost to produce an item is so low, they can sell cheaply...and WalMart can turn the product around and retail it cheaply. China is becoming the manufacturing giant that the U.S. was in the last century. They are also becoming the biggest creditor nation (and the U.S. is now the biggest debtor nation). China holds more of our dollars than we do.

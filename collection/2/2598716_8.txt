Don't trust those. Stick w/ the original. GOD said not to add or take anything away from His word.(Rev 22:18-19) Whenever I read the Bible, I ask to GOD to reveal to me what is word means and that I will test the sprit that comes to interpret it to me.(1 John 4:2-3; Proverbs 3:5-6) I don't want to be lead astray.

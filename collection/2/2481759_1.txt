I am a nurse in a retirement home and even if I'm having a bad day I always try to be cheerful(not gushy cause that scares them).But you have to realize that no matter how bad your life is right at that moment theirs is worse look how they live you are there only hope for some conversation and conversation,or contact with another person.Some of them face death everyday or pain beyond what you have ever felt.They don't fear death they may welcome it .So smile take there hand and listen to their stories you may never hear such things from another person.We all have a story to tell we just need someone to listen.. But if you can't be cheerful or kind quit you job don't go in like a nurse Hatchet from One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.. Take care ,smile cause it will help another.

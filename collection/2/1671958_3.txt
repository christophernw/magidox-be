An "in service" is a discussion or lecture to learn about medical procedures or guidelines. It can be conducted by the office physician or experienced personnel. It may or may not meet cme or ceu guidelines and may or may not result in "certification" depending on what the in service is about. It is often conducted during routine working hours, sometimes during a meal break.

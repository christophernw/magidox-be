i dont know that bi-polar disorders are cure-able. i think u have to treat it as a virus, something u have to live with forever. however there are things u can do to help counter act the effects of the disorder. i have heard that diet plays a big factor in disorders of this kind. also exercise, routine, and sunlight. so it sounds like to me that being in the navy would greatly help ur disorder and give u a better quality of life since they provide all of these things for u.

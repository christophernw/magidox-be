It may feel like it's important to have people like you, but it's truly much more important to like yourself. The more you like yourself and are comfortable with who you are, the more other people will respond to that confidence and charisma. This is one of those things where you have to let it go in order to achieve it. You can't worry about it. Besides popularity is fleeting. You may achieve it briefly but I can guarantee you that people are fickle and someday you'll have to stand on your own merits.

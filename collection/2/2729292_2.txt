I'm not a big fan of the term spontaneous combustion because the term to me at least implies that there was no source of ignition. If there is no apparent cause of a fire it is said to have started by spontaneous combustion. Oily rags can burst into flames suddenly but that is a chemical reaction caused by the different chemicals within the oils. As for spontaneous human combustion I consider that to be a myth. There may be documented case of it happening but we humans make poor fuel for a fire due mainly to the fact that we are mostly water. So unless electrololisis occurs within our bodies I remain very skeptical about spontaneous human combustion.

sarhab is the only response(so far)that didnt say "they". . with that said...... . We do it because we can. I know that doesnt sound very nice. But the fact is: you are somewhat nameless and 100% faceless in this forum.  Im sure insecurities play a big role.(both sides)  You dont know who the person is behind the typed words. Try not to take it personally.. . Oh, by the way, I think that was a great question

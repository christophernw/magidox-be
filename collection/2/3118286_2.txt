God should be introduced first. Respect for one's self and for others must be taught in the home at the earliest age. It must be a comfortable part of everyone's environment and as easy as the need for air, food and shelter. Adequate job training and JOBS along with education are secondary to the home-based knowledge that is presented at an early age. When no one has to defend themselves because of one thing or another, there will be no need for crime and violence.

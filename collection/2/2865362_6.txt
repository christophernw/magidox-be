It isnt actually the distance that causes it. It is the angle at which the sun shines on equatorial zones. It is almost straight up in the sky as opposed to an angle. If you move higher up the globe, the sun is at more of an angle, meaning you will see it more towards the horizon instead of directly up over your head.

The best way is to wait til you can pay cash, it will save you money, give you bargaining power, and so forth, but most likely you need it now so you will have to either borrow it or go to a super high interest miss a payment and you are screwed for life place.  Look for ads that say, "Any credit, nobody turned down" and stuff like that, but you will be sorry.  I guarantee the car will not last nearly as long as the payments.

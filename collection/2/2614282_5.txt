Copta Mica in Romania. It was during the period of their revolution in 1989 and I had to spend some hours at the train station there. The place was notorious in Romania (maybe still is) as a super nasty industrial zone, loaded with pollution and grime. Everything was black, the streets, buildings, everything. There was a greasy, nasty soot that covered everything. Most animals there lived only a few years and humans from the area had shortened life spans. .     At one point I slipped and my jeans got a good coating of the oily soot. Later that night in a town an hour away we got to a hotel and gave the maid the jeans to wash. She came back a couple hours later. She had spend a huge amount of time, just trying to get these jeans clean and had not toally succeeded. You could still see the dark stain on the pants. She was very upset because she knew I was an American (most Romanians at that time had never seen ANY foreigners) and thought I would look down on her. My Romanian buddy told her not to worry, that we had come from Copta Mica and that she did a great job considering the grime. She smiled and said she should have realized where the soot had come from. We gave her a tip worth a few days pay (only a few dollars!) and she left happy. .     A couple years later in the U.S. ABC News happened to do a piece on the town and gave even more grim information. It really freaked me out that they had found this place. It was truly NASTY.

My dear person...If you are trying to get away with as much as you can you certainly must not be "born again"  A Christian is not exempt from sinning but has an advocate with the Heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, our Lord...He took all our sins to the cross and forgiveness comes through belief in Christ...Christ says, "No man cometh unto the Father, except through me (Christ)" Don't you want to please a God who gave His Son to die,on a cross, so you could be saved?  I'll pray for you...

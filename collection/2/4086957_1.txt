If you can get hold of 'blank newsprint' its really cheap paper, like the stuff they use for wrapping chips. You can make as many copies of your screen blocks as you need, they last for a few prints before they need replacing.. Start with the original design, work out how many colours you'll use, make a template for each colour.. Then make as many copies as you want.

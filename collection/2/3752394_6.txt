I am a Muslim and I think Muslims were way out of order in the way they reacted to the cartoons, their is no excuse for that kind of violence and disorderly behavior.  Personally feel the prophet Mohammed peace and blessings of God be upon him would have been disgusted!  I think a peace full protest would have been good because the cartoons were very offensive.. . With regards to the Terrorists a lot of prominent Muslim figures have denounced the terrorism publicly.  But all real practicing Muslims are against these terrorists, but there not goin onto the streets. . . The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said about not being anxious to engage in the battlefield and to pray for peace and security instead.  . . If we studied honestly and objectively the life of the Prophet from authentic and unbiased sources we will find that he never engaged in the battlefield nor did he approve of battles other than to repel aggression, including legitimate pre-emptive strike against pending attack, or to stop aggression or persecution.  . . It is known that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) lived in a very simple and self-imposed simplicity like any poor person lived. When he died he owned virtuously nothing. Even on his deathbed he insisted that whatever money he had must be given to the poor.

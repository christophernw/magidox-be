Perhaps the holocaust as it pertains to the Jews is more profound because it happened in our (or our parent's or our grandparent's) lifetime. Perhaps it is also so profound because it was basically one man who ordered and oversaw this mass murder-Adolf Hitler. No one can deny that he was a monster. And if you don't feel at all victimized by him, rest assured that he hated blacks as well. So you can claim some of the victim status of his legacy for yourself if you wish.  . . Frankly, I see what you are doing-you are trying to say that slavery was just as bad if not worse than the Holocaust. I agree. Do you know any one who was a slave or who owned a slave-I mean, any one living? Are any of you neighbors slavery survivors? Slavery sucked. It was awful. But in terms of our history (American history, which is relatively brief when compared to that of other nations) it's ancient. . . Furthermore, WWII ended roughly 50 years ago, the descendants of Jewish victims are not still citing the holocaust as their excuse for not achieving success. The same cannot be said of many of the descendants of slaves. . . So, rather than waste your time and energy trying to decide which ethnic group has the greatest claim to victim fame, why not divert that energy to something constructive like...getting a life.

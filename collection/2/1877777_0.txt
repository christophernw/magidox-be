HIV is a retrovirus, and it cannot be cured by antibiotics, as they only work on bacteria, fungi, mold, etc.  However, HIV decreases your immune system response making you more likely to get really sick and possibly die from even the common cold.  The antibiotics work against the bacteria in the environment keeping you healthier.

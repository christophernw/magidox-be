The mid-oceanic ridge is an area of high volcanic activity.  Magma moves up to the surface as the tectonic plates spread apart from each other, creating an area of hot, porous rocks.  As the rocks cool, they condense together and take up less space.  This is what makes the slope of the ridge.  The faster the tectonic plates are moving, the more gradual the slope will be.

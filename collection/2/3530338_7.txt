If exercise and going to sleep earlier do not help, then you may want to go to a sleep specialist. It only takes one night usually to make sure there isn't something physically wrong with why you are not getting good sleep. . . Of course if you really want a "jolt" out of bed, you may want to try this alarm clock http://www.dutchguard.com/p-SB1000ss.html. It shakes the bed, flashes lights, and has a loud siren noise.

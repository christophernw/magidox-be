Money is no longer given to Palestine.. . Israel is the only country in the middle east that is a complete ally to us.  We supply weapons to them because they are a Jewish nation surrounded by aggravated Arab nations (that have tried to destroy Israel before).  The only money ever given to Palestine was aid money.  Israel doesn't need a lot of aid money, since they have the strongest economy (by far) in the middle east.

It depends on what kind of gravy. Whether your thickening juice from a meat that you cooked or your using powder mix. A good thickening agent is cornstarch. You mix a little in cold water and add it to the juices from the meat or if you use the powder its good to use hot water and a whisk. Or you can save alot of time and use the can.

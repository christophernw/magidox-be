A man who is not gay, but who takes excessive care with the way he looks.  That extends to the hairstyle, skincare, weight control, fitness, health, fashion, grooming, plastic surgery when necessary, dentistry when necessary, laser depilation when necessary, the right cologne, the right car, the right girl, the right accessories. Look at David Beckham. He's the number one metrosexual in the world.

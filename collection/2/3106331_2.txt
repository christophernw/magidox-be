Well, you can believe that a Big Bang happened out of nothing?  (Then where did the nothing come from?). and that everything happened to form a sun, happened to have gas and materials form into a planet. Happened to have it at the perfect angle, the perfect distance from the sun, the perfect tilt, the perfect moon, the perfect rotation, the perfect design of water, tectonic plates, land.  And that by chance matter happened to come together and evolve into a goo by chance and turned into organisms by chance and turned into fish and reptiles and animals by chance and formed brains and nerves and blood and immune systems by chance and plants evolved by chance to form food which by chance sustains us and by chance humans evolved from an ape and we have all that we know today by a freak chance.  And when we die we'll just rot into nothing and know nothing because we are nothing more than decayed matter.. . Or, you can believe that we were created by the Almighty God, who formed and shaped the world and everything in it, and created us in his own image to have dominion over the earth and the animals and birds of the air.  And that he loves us and cares for us and that if we believe in him he will take us into heaven which is a far better place that he created where we will always be happy and rejoice and there will be no pain or tears.  Believe what you will.

No tradition that we generally practice today is forbidden for today.  The passage in Jeremiah that seems to describe a "Christmas tree" was referring to making an idol out of the tree, it was forbidding the vain worship that the pagans participated in.  However, there was a tradition fairly recently (past 200 years or so) that certainly wasn't very Christ like.... . If you are familiar with all the verses of "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" you know that there are some pretty interesting lyrics to the song...  "Now bring us some figgy pudding..." "...We won't go until we get some..."  Going house to house demanding that people fix you some treat was actually a Christmas tradition in England (and probably colonial America)!

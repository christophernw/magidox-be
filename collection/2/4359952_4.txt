"Sunday" has second act troubles, as does "Into the Woods". "Company" is far too dated, and "Forum" too juvenile. I'd have to agree that "Sweeney" is the best: a cohesive plot that keeps the audience gripped, different musical stylings. Close second is a tie with "A Little Night Music" and "Follies". I've only heard the score for each and found them captivating.

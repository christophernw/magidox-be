The simple reason is that men with absolutely no military training or experience are running the show and refused to listen to our professional military men who told them to hold off on the war until the troops could be properly prepared, both with the proper equipment and the proper training for the task.  These "leaders" and their self-appointed "war presnit" don't give a rat's patoot about your brother, my son and daughter (both of whom are serving) or any member of the Armed Services.  Ever heard the term "cannon fodder"?  That's all our servicemen and women are to these neo-fascist scum - nameless trash with which to stuff cannons to shoot at whomever the "leadership", in their demented ravings, decides is currently the enemy.  And the worst of it is, we allowed these cretins to take control despite mountains of evidence they not only stole the d a m n elections in 2000 and again in 2004, but that they would immediately begin trying to turn this bastion of freedom and democracy called the United States into a dictatorship/police state.  We're almost there...

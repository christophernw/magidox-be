Hiya; I'm a Brit married to an American, and I just asked her this question. She said "we don't see it written down that often, as we're not particularly exposed to European culture. And everytime we hear it pronounced, we hear it as 'Van Go', because the guttural 'gh' is not something we're familiar with.". . My darling girl has really had to deal with a lot of bizarre English since she came over here. I used to work in Southwark - Pronounced Suthuck - and London's full of places like Chiswick - Chizzick - and so on.... . I know that someone's name is someone's name and should probably be pronounced as they pronounced it really, but in terms of pure linguistics, there's no more reason why Van Gogh shouldn't be "Van Go" than the word sigh should be "siff".. . :o)

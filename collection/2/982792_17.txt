Whether you agree with them or not you should still respect what other people believe, otherwise you're just as ignorant as you claim them to be.  Religion falls under free will and free speech.  I don't agree with organized religion either, in fact I find it down right dispicable, but I still am horrified and offended when I hear about people breaking church windows and tagging temples.  If you appreciate your free speech and your right to believe what you want you have to grant that freedom to everyone else.

The best way is to first use a wooden cutting board and soak the board in lemon juice first.  What happens is that when you cut the onion little particles of the onion juice gets launched into the air by the cutting of the onion.  By having a good circulation does help as well but where ever the air gets blowed too gets the onion juice.  I used to work in a restaurant with an open face grill that all food was made in full view of the patron.  However when ever I would prep the onion when I washed the board down with the lemon juice it helped for some reason to keep the onion from launching the little particles in the air.

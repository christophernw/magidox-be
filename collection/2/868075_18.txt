It's obviously a matter of opinion, but seeing as how I'm a missionary of sorts for my Christian faith, I would say that this is why you should become a Christian, and I hope that you do-. . God, his son Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are all one, and the only true god in our universe.  He loves you unconditionally and will forgive you and love you always, no matter what you do.  You only have to turn to him and profess your faith in him, that you trust your life to him, in order to join him in Heaven when you die.  Many Christians feel that their faith gives them a sense of peace and well-being.. . I hope this has helped you in your decision.

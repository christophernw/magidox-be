I've had hiccups for hours in the past. What I have learned that gets rid of them every time is to put yourself in a situation that gets you as nervous as possible. . . For example, one time I had hiccups for quite a while (this was at a time when I was just learning to drive). So I decided to ask my mother to take me driving, and as I started to hit the steets, my nerves began to kick in. I became very nervous as I was trying to drive, and as a result, my hiccups vanished. This happened in a few other instances as well, where nerves squashed hiccups.

The Medici family controlled the flow of money during that era.  If a King wanted to wage war, or build a new palace they had to work with the Medici's to get the money.. . As for Cosimo himself do you mean the "founder"  Cosimo the Elder (1389 - 1464) who really got things going, or do you mean Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany (1519 - 1574) ?

By allowing all different opinions and grievances to be publically heard and discussed. For example, the Chinese shot people who spoke out against some of their governmental policies rather than let them publically air their grievances. In this way, those in power there remain in power because there is no way for like-minded people to band together since they don't know who would be like-minded and who would turn them in to the government.

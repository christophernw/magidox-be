The Sun isn't yellow.  It's white.  The reason it LOOKS yellow is that the shorter (bluer) wavelengths of light from it tend to be scattered by the atmosphere, while the longer (redder) wavelengths tend to go straight to your eye.  The color of a sheet of white paper, or fresh white snow is the true color of sunlight.  That's because such a surface is reflecting both the direct and scattered light.

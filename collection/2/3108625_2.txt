Hi I am a mortgage consultant, an interest only loan is always charged at a higher interest rate than a principal and interest loan, and if you are paying interest only then you are not paying anything off the purchase price of the property, there are lots of opportunities at the moment for better mortgage deals, if you are located in Australia then contact me and I will give you free advice. shemay1@yahoo.com

Christians are told what to believe and then told that they need to have "faith" when what they are told doesn't make any sense.  Christians are lied to in order to keep them oppressed and happy with the crappy lives they lead.  "the meak shall inherit the earth" is a christian saying that tells them...hey, don't worry that your life sucks cause your gonna get everything when you die.  Now that really is more relevent in older times but still it's the faith thing.. . On the other hand I like the christian religion because you can sin all you want as long as you can get out an apology before you die you'll be okay :)  Have some faith will ya!

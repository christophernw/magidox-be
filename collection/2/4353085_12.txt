The English word "Switzerland" is pronounced so the first syllable rhymes with "wit".. . However, what they say there is "die Schweitz", which sounds like sh-vites (as in "invites" - short for "invitations"), so I guess saying the first syllable so it rhymes with "white" is closer to the original pronounciation.

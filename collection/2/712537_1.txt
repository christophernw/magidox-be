? Under what conditions? Maybe you are just adjusting the osmotic pressure of the medium... Above 0.6 M (if I remember correctly) E.coli cells don't grow.. . Yes they can take up a linear plasmid and if the ends are phosphorylated they will ligate it and proliferate happily ever after.. Usually after restriction I dephosphorylate my vector (especially if using a single restriction enzyme) to minimize background from re-ligated plasmid.

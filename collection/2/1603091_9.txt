Hi!. . We first have to find out the "Greek" word from which your word "science" was translated from.. . The Greek for the word "science" is "KNOWLEDGE"...Check the modern English translations...they translated it "KNOWLEDGE":. . 1Tim 6:20  "O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you. Avoid the irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called "knowledge,". . In Timothy's times, were false scientific results like the modern one of HUMAN EVOLUTION...Therefore Paul was warning him against such unproven scientific results that are designed to DISPROVE THE EXISTENCE OF GOD!. . Teachings such as Evolution indirectly teaches that there is no God therefore people would not not be bothered by their wrong-doing, thinking that there is no God!. . All science point to Jesus Christ to be the Lord!. . PROOF:. . When the following verse was written, continents had already parted from being one MASS DRY GROUND and there were no satellites to take the overall PICTURE of the CONTINENTS for people of those times to know that continents were actually ONE MASS DRY LAND on the sea:. . (Get a world map, you'll notice that CONTINENTS fit to each other like puzzles...this means that the dry land was one MASS of a CONTINENT ORIGINALLY) Now look at the verse:. . Genesis 1:9  "And God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so. . . Gen 1:10  "God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.". . Where could the writer of this verse have known this because at the time, they did have a map of the whole world to know that at some point, the earth was made up of one DRY LAND on the sea.... . . Unless the HUMAN WRITER OF THE VERSE was FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT?(2 Tim 3:16). . God bless you.

we have national guard members on their second, third, and fourth tours of duty in iraq. the military has been stretched thinner than any time in modern history. so, we're talking about sending a national guard that we may not have any capacity to send to protect our borders. that's really not the role of the national guard. however, given that the military is in iraq, it might be better to have the one's on active duty in the states to patrol the borders until the border patrol can be bolstered to the level necessary to protect the border.

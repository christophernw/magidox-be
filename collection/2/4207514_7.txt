Be careful... many stock brokers are out for themselves and not you.  The best finance teacher I had asked us NOT to become stock brokers and she was one!! Prior to her teaching career.  If you're LOADED... then find a really good, honest one!  If not... stick with mutual funds like Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab and Vanguard funds.  The common funds are similar to the Dow Jones market index (the one we hear about every evening on the news) or S & P 500 fund (the other index we hear about every day.)  Best wishes, C.

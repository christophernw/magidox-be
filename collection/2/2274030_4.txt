Techincally, you are introduced as you want to be called.  If you want to be called "Ms. Jones", when someone introduces you as "Patty", then shake hands and say "Ms. Jones".  If you want them to know your last name, then when you shake hands say "Patty Jones".  If you want to be Patricia, say "Patricia, please".  They won't think twice about it and you won't be offended for them calling you something you don't like.

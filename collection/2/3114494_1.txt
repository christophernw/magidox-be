first you have to demonstrate to the courts why the children would be better of emotionally and physically living with you as opposed to their mother. what country are you in? children aged over ten years old generally have a say in where they go. are you able to provide a stable home for them, not only now but long term? demonstrate this to the court? are you able to take time off work when you need to? would you ensure they had contact with their mum and maternal family? Do you have anything on your record that might work against you, such as prior convictions, AVO's etc.. if you do you better figure out how to downplay these in court. remember that generally children require maternal love. i'm not saying dad's aren't as important, but it is essential that you allow there mum to be a part of their lives also. get a good solicitor, courts are notorious for giving custody to mum's. Good Luck! I hope you are doing the right thing for the children, not yourself. If my ex attempted to get custody of ny son, i'm afraid i would have him knocked off. LOL just kidding. I live in australia, and that just wouldn't happen.

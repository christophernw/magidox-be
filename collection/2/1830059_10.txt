So many reasons... I believe our Constitution sums it up pretty well..... . The Constitution of the United States guarantees freedom of speech, religion, the press, the right to a fair trial, the right to keep and bear arms, universal suffrage, and property rights.. . America has been very blessed, as well as the American citizen. People from all over the world come to America in search of a better life.. . It is absolutely the best country in the world!. . Unfortunately, there are those Americans that disagree and complain, but then, they can do that...this is America!

Wait until sundown when the bees all go into the nest and pour gasoline into the hole. You don't have to set it on fire. The fumes from the gasoline will kill the bees. Wait, with the cost of gas these days I don't know if this is economically feesible. LOL. . . Seriously, I have done this countless times and it has always worked.  It doesn't take much gas and it quickly evaportate so there isn't a fire hazard.

I could jump up and say that these don't really have anything in common, but perhaps there is one connection; they can't help it. Also, I won't make fun of either one, even if I'm not either one. The mentally challenged can't help it, and the religious people just think that way. Please don't diss them. I'd prefer to show that I can be a nice person and not have to be religious to do it.

I once managed a restaurant where I had an extremely gifted young man as a waiter..His incredibly dry humor delighted the snooty people that frequented the upscale restaurant.... . And I was always amazed.. being the type of person that would want a happy customer.. I wouldn't have dared said HALF the things he was able to get away with.. . My favorite was once when I saw this waiter speak to a couple and they laughed and then the man of the couple decided to give a joke in return.. to which I heard the waiter say with a smileless face, "I'll go get your coffee now to go with that really bad joke".. and he simply walked away from them, they burst into laughter again.. . I thought.. How blessed he is to tell another person EXACTLY what you think of them, even if he exaggerated what he really meant and have them roll it off their shoulders as being unoffensive. . . I must revise to say, there were so many ways this young man could make a mountain out of a molehill and still keep them laughing. A tie, an umberella, a vehicle, it didn't matter..he could say the biggest whoppers of small truths he actually felt, and he still received smiles...but got his point across just the same I am sure.

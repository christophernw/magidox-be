A chromosome is a large macromolecule into which DNA is normally packaged in a cell. Minimally, it is a very long, continuous piece of DNA (a single DNA molecule), which contains many genes, regulatory elements and other intervening nucleotide sequences.. . In the chromosomes of eukaryotes, the uncondensed DNA exists in a quasi-ordered structure inside the cell nucleus, where it wraps around histones (structural proteins, Fig. 1), forming a composite material called chromatin. Each chromosome has two arms, the shorter one called p arm (from the French petit, small) and the longer one q arm (q follows p in the Latin alphabet). During mitosis (cell division), the chromosomes are condensed and a spindle composed of microtubules is formed. Microtubules self-assemble from dimers of alpha and beta tubulin. They attach to chromosomes at specialized structures called kinetochores, one of which is present on each sister chromatid. Sister chromatids are attached at an area called the centromere (not necessarily at the center of the chromosome). A special DNA base sequence in the region of the kinetochores provides, along with special proteins, longer-lasting attachment in this region. This is the only natural context in which individual chromosomes are visible with an optical microscope.. . Prokaryotes do not possess histones or nuclei. In its relaxed state, the DNA can be accessed for transcription, regulation, and replication.. . You could get more information from the link below...

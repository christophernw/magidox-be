Interesting !. I see it this way : God is the Word, according to John 1, or , God is a spirit John 4 v 24.. Therefore the Word enters our minds which is the earth , and the female.(read the explanation after the parrable of the sower ) . The seed is male, ( hence He ) and the earth is female (mother earth)..  I think God is not a man as such, but a spirit, or a power, a force ? Hope you can see this ?. Regards.

Okay, first of all, your #1 priority should be saving for your retirement...it's sweet that you want to provide for your kids, but you can best do that by not being a burden for them when you grow old.. . If you are only making 20-30k a year, it might be a good idea to invest in yourself with some additional training or education so that you can get a better job and make more money.  One of you may need to take a second job.. . As far as expenses, if you have cable TV, get rid of it.  Use the rabbit ears.  Stop going out to eat for lunch/dinner.  Stop buying coffee at the gas station, make it at home.  Get rid of your cell phones.  Don't buy name brands, buy generic. Drop all the fancy services on your phone and get a $10 answering machine from Wal-Mart.  You may have done some or all of these things, but these are typical expenses people have that they deem important.  They're not.. . Another thing is, and this may sound cruel, don't have any more kids until you can afford to have them.  Kids are wonderful, but very expensive.. . If you want your teenager to have a savings account, suggest that they get a job and learn the value of a dollar.  They will learn more from having to earn the money for something they want than they will if it is just given to them.  Of course you want to provide for your kids, but you'll do them a better service by teaching them a work ethic.. . Just my 2 cents.  Good luck to you.

Sometimes it will go away after the shock that caused it fades.  However, sometimes it is a permanent condition.  The condition is called Tinnitus and is quite common.  I live with this from a disease called Menear's.  It can be annoying and occasionally debilitating temporarily.  However, live goes on and you can adapt.  Check with a physician if the ringing does not stop.

To live it!. I once had a dream that I met my spirit guide.  I said, "so, you are my guide."  My guide said, "Yes, I am."  I said, "Gee, guide, then you can tell me the meaning of life."  My guide said, "I can."  Then, my alarm went off and I had to wake up.  At first I thought what a crummy thing, he didn't even tell me my meaning, and then when I told one of my friends, she laughed and said "yes, he did, he made you get up to live it."  So, live life!

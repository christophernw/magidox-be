Hmm.  That's probably because when glue sticks, it dries.  Think about it.  Whenever you used to make crafts as a kid, the more glue you used, the longer it took to dry.  There is SO much glue in the bottle that it can't really dry because there is so much of it and it isn't exposed to air very much.  And because it doesn't dry, it doesn't stick.  Wet glue doesn't hold, dry glue does(once again remember those crafts as a kid:  you didn't mess with it till you knew the glue had dried and it was finally stuck)  Get it??

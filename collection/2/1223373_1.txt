i had mono a few years back... i had no idea i had it until i got flu like symptoms.  i was always tired before hand anyways so by the time the flu stuff came i wasn't contagious anymore.. . look for dark circles under your eyes.... . i remember the odd thing about the whole time i had mono was i was dead tired but i couldn't fall asleep... maybe that'll help.

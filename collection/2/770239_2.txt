Good question. I managed 7-11's for 5 years. The reason there are locks on the doors is so the clerk can work in the cooler or back room while the store is open. Additionally, there are times, such as during repairs, floor stripping (wax), power outages, or unforseeable emergencies when it would be necessary to lock the doors.

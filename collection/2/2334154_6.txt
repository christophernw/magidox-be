I love horses!  My favorite breed is quarter horse, because they are calm, easy temperament, easy to train and ride.  I've had Paso Fino's and Missouri Fox Trotters, they are ever so gorgeous to look at but they are hot wired and can hardly stand still for more than a few seconds, and I didn't care for this.  So quarter horses it is for me!

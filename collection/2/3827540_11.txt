The best way is just use eye contact.  If someone looks at you and you look back, you should be able to tell.  Check for wedding rings too.  Gay men wear rings too, but usually they are silver or have stones on them.  There is not specific clothing that means someone is gay, but some guys may have an earring just in the right ear--this fad is going out though, so I don't know how helpful it will be.  The best way is just to be observant of how other guys look at you.

assume it is made in taiwan. buying us made tie wire is probably expensive. anything galvanized will be more expensive as well. not all tie wire is galvanized. when galvanized pipe/wire is burned you will see a yellow smoke emitted and this smoke will make you very sick. anything galvanized will do that when burnt. it is far more common to find tie wire that is not galvanized. it's also know as bailing wire

Well, I work with teens at church and at my local school. The number one answer was, parents doesn't spent much time with their teens and give them too much time to spent with their friends.  They got more input from friends than parents. They feels like their friends always there for them, they can share lots of friendship and closeness together. This socially make them important as a person and special being accepted by their peers. Parents does not give this quality to them (very rare parents has this quality), so thats why they dislike their parents.  Hope this will answer your question.  Nit.

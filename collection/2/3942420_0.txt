my cat, karizma does the same thing and she's almost 8.. it's called kneading.  i've heard that if they're taken away from their mother too early that happens, and it's a way to get their mothers milk when their kittens.. it also means their content and happy with you. (my cat purrs constantly when she kneads)  it's soothing to them.

I sort of know what you're saying.  I was looking at a website with pictures of registered sex offenders and I showed my friend and we were talking about how some of them looked so young and "normal" (I say that word loosely)  Anyway, we were talking about it and I'm sure a lot of them especially the younger ones were 18 or 19 and had intercourse with a 15 or 16 year old.  I think that is sort of a crappy law.  I don't think teenagers should be having sex but if they do have conscentual sex then I don't really see the problem.  . I do know what you mean but where should we draw the line ya know?  I think that child molestors should have their d.icks cut off though seriously!!

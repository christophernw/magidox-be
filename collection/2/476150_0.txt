In todays world you can't always depend on others to be always there to help you in times of trouble... be prepared take defense classes(workin out on the gym or on gym bags can lessen the emotional stress and pain you are feeling), plan out your move and defend your territory dude!!! but, always be sure to have plan b if your initial move fails.  hehehe.... or you can always try peaceful ways to get even...

There are a number of reasons bird flock. It is true that there are safety in numbers. If there are a hundred birds together an individual 's chances of being picked up drop dramatically. If you watch a flock of blackbirds you can tell when there is a hawk nearby. They will group in a tight "ball" rather than a loose strung out flock.. . American White Pelicans and Northern Shovelers (a type of duck) use flock behavior to feed. The group will swim in a circle, tightening inward to drive fish and other water creatures into the center to feed on them. . . Geese, and some other birds, migrate in flocks in V formation to make long flights easier. The shape of the V makes flying easier for the birds farther back. They will take turns at the front, the roughest place to fly, so no individual bird will get exhausted.. . Some species of birds have a social system set up in their flock. Their breeding system is part of that system. Some species of ducks even set up a "day care" like situation where one bird will care for another's young temporarily. . . Bird behavior is a fascinating subject. This barely skims the surface of the surface. I would recommend David Attenbourgh's Life of Birds series, aired originally on PBS for a short painless course on avian life!

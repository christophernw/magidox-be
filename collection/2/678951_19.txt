Where does the bible ban alcohol?  It warns about drunkenness and warns not to enter the tabernacle drunk, but there is no alcohol ban.  Jesus turned water into wine at the wedding feast.  He didn't open a can of Welches concentrate and make juice for the guests.  I believe that wine is suggested as a stomach remedy somewhere, I don't thump my Bible so I can't tell you chapter and verse.. Where in the heck does it say "Thou shalt not smoke"?. You are very confused.  READ the Bible and live it.

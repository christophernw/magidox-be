It means that our faith, given as a gift from God, establishes the Mosiac law given in the Old Testament during the exodus fo Egypt to the promise land.  Let's go through a couple steps.. The law was created for man to realize what sin was and how it was separation from Him.  Only Jesus was able to keep the law, since He was not born into sin, which occured through the generations.  Jesus, on Calvary, fulfilled the law's requirement for blood atonement and sacrifice.  (read Hebrews 1-8, this was help better understand this).. In Romans 6, it states that we are no longer under the law but under grace.  Only those who are no under the Holy Spirit's guidance, and accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior are under the law, which condemns mankind for their actions.  Christians are under God's grace, which allows people to walk in truth through faith.  Bible says that faith, through grace, is a gift from God.  grace and faith must coincide to understand the truth.

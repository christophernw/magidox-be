There are different types of diabetes, all to do with the body's use of insulin.  Some diabetics can be treated by diet alone before it gts serious, and others are insulin-dependant for the rest of their lives.  Some have it when they are young, and others get mature-onset diabetes when they are...mature! There's shed loads of stuff about it on the Net, far too much to put down here!

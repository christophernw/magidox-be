I believe in a democracy that any nomination--and especially one with a life-long term--should be controversial.  Controversy is not a bad thing--and the American public has a right to know where the nominee stands.  Very few of us ever heard of Judge Alito before he was nominated.  He's probably a "very nice man". . .but there is more that we need to know than that.

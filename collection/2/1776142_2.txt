Theres no real answer to this because they wont quit unless they want to quit. So your mission is to get them to get the disire to quit and let them know you will be their support team. Tell them you love them and you want them to be around for a while. Look on the internet when i quit i found websites on people that died from smoking and their familys made those sites for them, they tell their personal struggle and what it was like to go threw loving someone while they watch them die, share those sites with the one you love and tell them you dont want to go threw what these other people went threw but more importantly you dont what them to go threw what all those that died went threw, i quit smokeing and looking threw those really helped me, not only that but tell them to try every option patches, gum what ever they need, stop smoking in the house so they wont constatly smell smoke on quit day, thats like sending a alcholic to a bar and telling him to drink water lol good luck :) hope that helps

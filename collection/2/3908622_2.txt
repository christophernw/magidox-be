Perhaps it all comes down to the fact that when you lose something so tragically, and suddenly it is difficult to replace it with the same thing. To many, that would cheapen the loss, like just dumping another 99 cent gold fish in the bowl when the last has died. . . Building something new gives a sense of re-building, not replacing. Nothing can replace what was lost that day. But perhaps we can re-build our lives, offices, and society. . . just my humble opinion.

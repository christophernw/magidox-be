There are 2 reasons for it.. One, is it helps you learn the material better.  You can take more time at home to re-read it.  You're too rushed at school.. . The other reason has nothing to do with school.  Homework is getting you used to the real world after you leave school.. We always have bills to pay, taxes and negotiations in writing with people in our work place and in buying a home, etc.. . It's like doing your chores that your parents made you do.  To get you used to it.. . Believe me, when you get out on your own, you'll have more homework than ever.  They're preparing you for the shock.. . You'll never escape it.

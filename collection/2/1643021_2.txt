You can grown pretty much anything indoors if you take care of it properly. Personally, I tend to kill plants, but my father has had great success with quite a few different herbs. Cilantro, parsley, dill, basil, and quite a few others. If you have anything in particular you'd like to grow, the best bet would be to check out the specifics of growing that plant in your area, and the difference between growing it inside instead of out.

Get off the computer for one. The megapixels in your computer might not help with that. Go to the doctor's office and ask questions. Don't stop when they say that they already gave you medication. If the medication doesn't work, it's their job to replace it and keep you safe and healthy. Tell them exactly what you said in the question about the amount of seizures you've had, what you hurt during it, what still hurts, everything.

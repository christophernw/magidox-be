It comes of the ancient worship of fertility gods. Rabbits were a symbol of fertility for obvious reasons (ever raised rabbits?)  Then eggs, also, are an obvious symbol of fertility.  So the two were combined.  I am glad they decided to make them out of chocolate though!. You are right, it has absolutely nothing to do with the Christian Easter holiday.

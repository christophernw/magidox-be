should clear some misconceptions here.... in usa, which is percieved to be the forerunner in womens' rights, has there been any women president? noo....south asian countries, which belong to the third world, and percieved that there is little women's rights there, namely sri lanka, pakistan, bangladesh and india have all had women prime ministerss. hows that ? and the feminist revolution started in the west started in the west after the world war.. however, look at south asia, women were respected as they were and given their share of rights.... that is,, until the westerner started colonising most of the south asia..

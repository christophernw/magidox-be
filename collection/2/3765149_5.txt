Martyrs are not people who commit suicide. You are a Martyr when you are fighting in a war and don't intent to die but will die to support your religion. Killing people for revenge or out of anger, and killing innocent people will not reward you with Paridise according to the Quran. Its just probably that the Clerics are using these misguided people to propel their interests. But only God has the finally say, but again Martyrs aren't people who purposely commit suicide. These people just don't read the Quran.

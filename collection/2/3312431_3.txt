Since the days get shorter-gets dark about  1 and 1/2hs arlier and stays dark longer esp when school buses ar on the road picking children up to take to school and children are at bus stops waiting for the buses and so its actually for a safety factor that this time change occurs. With the time change it is light when the children leave homes to walk to the bus stops and the buses are on the highways and interstates-much safer.

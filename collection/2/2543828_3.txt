A characteristic of a human being is the ability to have an opinion.. . Everyone is misinformed when it comes down to it, because there is too much information out there for any single person to digest or make sense of. Everything comes down to opinion. Someone who tells you you are misinformed, has not realised how little they actually know themselves.

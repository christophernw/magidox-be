Just start over,  think  creatively  what u have done wrong  and  plan  how  u would  not  do that  again,  just  change  your environment if u feel to do so,  and  start all over again.  Its  normal  that  lot of people  do  wrong in their lives ,  but  the better thing  is  that u know  that and admit  that.  So u just got to work  on  a plan  out  and  be optimistic for that.  Start over my friend

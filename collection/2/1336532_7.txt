You don't have a gas leak it is probably a clogged or block vapor line that runs to your gas tank.  And it wouldn't have anything to do with turning on your A/C  maybe its bringing the smell into the car through the vents because your windows are closed up but its not because the air is running.. NOTE: if you had gas leaking you would see it on the ground.

Political correctness is unbelieveable now.  . . The people who are the worst off are middle aged white men.  Think about it, there's no card they can pull!!. . I don't have a problem with britain being multi-cultural.  The problem is the tables are turning to the point where in certain areas white people are the extreme minority and they are enduring racism day in day out.  It seems as though white people don't have the same rights as other cultures/religions when it comes to fighting this. . . It's quite sad really

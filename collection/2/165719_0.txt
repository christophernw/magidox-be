Hard-drive players have a hard drive similar to your computers: a spinning disk stores information on it and is read back it spins past a reader. A flash drive is much simpler: it's a solid-state memory that doesnt have moving parts. Nothing in it moves, so its less likely to break. But flash drive players usually have smaller capacities, but they also don't skip regardless of how much you shake it.

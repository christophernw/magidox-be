I've read the other answers and i agree that it is due to the gag reflex.  Many are more sensitive than others as well.  I know I can't even guzzle a beer.  My throat constricts.  So, don't feel like she's disgusted enough to puke, it's simply the gag reflex.  I do the same thing myself. ha ha.  She needs to back off and not go so deep.  That helps a lot.  Don't pressure her either about it or she will just become more tense causing the problem to intensify

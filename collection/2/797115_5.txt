Sorry, but if you're in England you need to be licensed to handle a bat. It needs secialist care that you just can't give it. What happens when its old enough to fly? You're not a bat and you can't show it where to hiberbate or survive.. Please call the RSPCA immediately and let them get it to one of the few experts who know how to look after it. They'll keep you in touch with its progress.

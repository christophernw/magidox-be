Mat (above) showed you a really good way of looking at what happens to your quotient when your denominator (divisor) approaches zero...the quotient approaches inifinity.. . However, as others stated, when the denominator reaches zero, the quotient is "undefined" (unless the numerator or dividend is also 0, in that case the quotient is "indeterminate").. . Here's another way to look at it..... . What is 6 / 3?  Of course the answer is 2.  How do you check yourself?  You take the quotient - 2 and multiply it back with the denominator (divisor) - 3 and make sure you get the original dividend (numerator) - 6.  And certainly 2  * 3 = 6.  This works because multiplication is the inverse operation of division.. . Now, let's take a look at:. 5 / 0?  What would this be?  Whatever it is, we know that when multiplied by 0, the product must be 5.  In other words...if 5 / 0 = x, then x * 0 should = 5.  What times 0 equals 5?  Since we have no defined value that would adequately answer this, we say that 5/0 is undefined.. . But what about:. 0/0?  Whatever this answer is, we know that when we multiply it by 0 the product must be 0.  In other words...if 0/0 = x then x * 0 should = 0.  What times 0 equals 0?  Well, everything.  Every real or complex value could be the answer.  Since we don't know what the actual value is, we say the answer is indeterminate.

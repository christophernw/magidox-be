first i want to tell you that i have a turtle too and she have 19 years old believe it or not. and it since i have that gift who someone offer to me that i want give it to someone. the aquarium it's very good and with a rock you can put something for her or him for go outside of the water and no outside of the aquarium and you know the turtle will be bigger and around 5 years you will need to change her aquarium. If you go to pet shop just ask to the salesman the food for turtle and don't give too much each day just one time around 8 to 10 sticks of the food. I wish you a big pleasure for your 20 years and maybe more with that turtle.

Look for wood around the house that seems to be rotting. The termites will be eating this, and probably more wood around the house. Dig into the wood a bit, and if there are tunnels running through the wood then termites have been there. And, if there are a bunch of termites running around that you can see, call and exterminate immediately before they get too far if they haven't already.

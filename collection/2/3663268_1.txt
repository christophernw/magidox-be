There's no good way.  . . First person gender is always known.  Second person singular (and plural) is neutral (both are "you") .  However, there is no neutral third person singular.  . . There are people who uses s/he, but that's both nonstandard and awkward.  You will never see that convention in standard writing.. . More common is to use "they" or "their" as third person singular.  "Their" is neutral and third person plural, but using the same logic as "you" (both singular and plural for second person), there are several writers who are pushing the use of "their" for use as third person singular.  Personally I like this approach, and have used it before.  However, it also is non-standard, and I wouldn't use it on an essay that's graded on grammar.. . The best usage in common practice is to use "the author" and "he or she" intermingled, but to minimize the use of the pronoun.  . . And in terms of the most grammatically correct English, the use of the male "he" for unknown gender, while not politically correct, is still grammatically correct.

There was a rise in moral "cleansing" (think Radical Right) because of the Roaring 20s.  People felt that it was their puritanical duty to prevent sin during this newly (but not quite revolutional) taboo era.. . Also, the government wasn't taxing alcohol like the last guy said and it was brought back into circulation once they figured out how to do so.

He created our original parents-Adam and Eve. They had perfect health, never was to die and would like under gods love for eternity. They sinned and thus we have sin. It is likened to baking bread. When you make bread, you need a mold to make a loaf. When that mold gets a dent or imperfection, then the rest of the loafs come out imperfect and with that dent. So if Adam and Eve didn't want to be like God, then we would all be in a Paradise earth free of crime, hunger, pain and suffering. . . God hasn't changed his intentions, he still plans on humans to live under those arrangements. See Psalms 37:11,

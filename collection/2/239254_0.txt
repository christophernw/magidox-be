so she put a quarter in the jukebox... .  o.k. I couldn't resist.....  if you can't see it I would have to say you would need to remove the cd player and open it up to try to access it... maybe you can or cannot get to it depending upon the design. basically consider the cd player shot right now anyway considering the same cd over and over again forever will drive you insane. if you are careful in taking it apart you should be able to put it back together... if you can see the quarter from the front though I would gently try to remove it with a tweezer...

Humidity in SC is bad I will not kid you. Some days in the heat of summer and you walk out it feels as if a hot wet blanked is drop over your head. Out west it can be 110 but when you sweat it drys and you feel cool. In SC sweating does not help it will not dry if the humidity is 95 and the temp in all so 95.. Winters there are not bad a few cold days and some ice. But much cooler than LA. In the summer all is green trees grass plants what is great. You can find a place near the woods you get a cool wide come out of the woods in the summer.

Im guessin they bake them in an oven. Its all part of a Polar Bear conspiracy to increase the methane in the air, melting the polar ice caps. . Now they can get their hands on those pesky penguins, which will be driven from their antartic home.......right into their clutches!! Evil laugh...... No seriously, I don't know why they do it cos it tastes gash!

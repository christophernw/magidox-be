I, for one, have noticed no such disparity.  Most guys I've been involved with were quite comfortable with either role as the mood took us both, as am I.  The idea that one must a "top" or a "bottom", with no change in role ever, strikes me as overly limiting, like saying one must be either "straight" or "gay" with bi not an option.  Human sexuality is way too complex and varied to be pigeonholed into that kind of black/white over generalization.

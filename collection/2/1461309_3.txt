I don't think gay men have a choice in the matter and bisexual men are just confused in the darkness of the closet. I don't understand why any man or woman would CHOOSE to be gay - who would want all the ridicule and discrimination? No one, though, being a lesbian woman is much more accepted by this male-driven society than being a gay man.. . As for the turning, or the coming out of the closet - there just comes a time when a person has to accept who they are and live with it.

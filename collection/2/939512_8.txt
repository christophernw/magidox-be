I would suggest opening an account with Saxo Bank. Saxo Bank is an investment bank operating in Denmark, London and Singapore. Through the bank you are able to trade global stocks and shares on 19 of the worlds most liquid and active stocks markets. For example, you can trade stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange through Saxo Bank. From my opinion, Saxo Bank's equities research is right on target on advising an investor what stocks to buy, take profit or cut loss. For more information i would suggest you try their free demo account. Have fun and happy trading !. Saxo Bank's website is www.saxobank.com

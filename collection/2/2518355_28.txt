Trust me!... It really does taste like rubbing alcohol. Everyone who said that is totally right! If you want to try hard alcohol, Vodka is probably not your best bet and it's definitly not worth fifty bucks! Unless your gonna mix it with something, then you may be able to handle it. Try buying some Vanilla Vodka and some Cranberry Juice. That tastes pretty good... I guess it's a "personal preference" question... Hey, there's a first time for everything! Good luck!

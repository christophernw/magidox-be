The rotatiing body will have an edge moving towards you and an edge moving away from you.  The edge moving toward you will be blue shifted, and the edge moving away from you will be red shifted.. . For objects that apear as pin-points (like stars) you can't see each edge, but rather the doppler effect will cause the spectral lines of the star to stretch out.  Instead of getting one wavelength you will get a spread in wavelengths.. . _______|______          Normal sharp spectral line. . _______/&#92;_________      Doppler broadened spectral line.

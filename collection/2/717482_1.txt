That is up to the Chapter 13 Trustee. I was able to buy a house 1 year after a Chapter 13 filing, using an old TSA account for the down payment. But first, I needed to petition the trustee for approval to do so.. . Yes, this was nearly 20 years ago, but two things you are doing under the Chap 13 is paying off debt, and hopefully showing stability.. . Your mileage may vary.

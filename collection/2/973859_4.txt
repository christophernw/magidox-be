well when you are only pretty much holding weight in the mid section then it's probably all about your diet. You can workout till the cows come home and you're not going to lose the belly until you make some diet changes. As far as working out that section, you really can't spot train. You can do crunches or whatever but they will only strengthen the muscles and not really burn much fat. The best way is cardio, cardio, cardio. If your heart rate is up for at least 20 min then consider it cardio and yes, even dancing. Remember to change your diet though and you'll see results.

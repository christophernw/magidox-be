this was an era of eugenics, which had been going on for a while before hitler's reign. jews were not the only group considered inferior -- gays, handicapped, blacks, etc. but he did not invent anti-semitism, he merely adopted it and capitalized on it to get elected. (sound familiar?) his identification of jews as the inferior race was otherwise arbitrary, his goal was that of power. the eugenics idea and social darwinism ideas were stirring about decades before.

Through any transparent or translucent material medium, like glass or air, it has a lower speed than in a vacuum; the ratio of c to this slower speed is called the refractive index of the medium (the actual speed is not affected, the speed of light is constant, the fact that the light is reflected around inside the glass will make a greater amount of time necessary for it to reach the next point). Changes of gravity, however, warp the space the light has to travel through,

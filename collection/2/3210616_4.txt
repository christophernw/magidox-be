There are many advantages! Like, not spending so much time shopping! Not being afraid of losing all you have in a fire. Lower insurance premiums. Forced into eating more healthily. Not tied to a economic system of capitalism. More time for the important things in life such as family, study, and self-development. Learn the value of recycling. Learn the value of sharing. And you learn to appreciate EVERYTHING you have been blessed with. It works for me.

Cathode ray tube (CRT) based displays rely on a beam that redraws they entire screen several times a second.  For the most part, the redrawing is too fast to see, it does result in a flickering effect, especially on older and lower quality televisions.  Some people are particularly sensitive to the flicker, resulting in eye strain and headaches.. . Plasma and LCD televisions are based on a different technology, that essentially draws the entire image at once, resulting into a clearer, flicker free image.  In addition, most of these TV's have sharper, higher resolution images, that are easier for your eyes to focus on.  Traditional TV's appear blurry by comparison.

You don't have to its your preference, but people wear tight underwear to keep their testicles from hanging when doing any form of cardio. When doing cardio and going freeballing, it can be very annoying to run or jog with your balls moving a lot. I only wear boxers but I may try to wear some boxer briefs when i try running.

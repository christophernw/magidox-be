You answered your own question. This is why we do not believe in evolution.  Who created the animals in the first place? Even though viruses mutate, most humans can fight them off without drugs.  How can that be possible? How does our immune system know what belongs there and what doesn’t? A special protein molecule, called MHC (major histocompatibility complex), sits on the surface of nearly every cell of our body. It is an identity tag that tells the immune system that this cell is a friend, a part of us, unique to us. The immune system thereby recognizes our own cells and accepts them but attacks any cells displaying different molecules on their surfaces—and all cells not ours do display surface molecules different from ours.. . So it is by means of these surface molecules that our immune system recognizes each cell as “us” or “them,” as self or nonself. If nonself, it triggers a reaction by our immune system. “The concept that the immune system must discriminate continually between self and nonself,” says the book Immunology, “is a cornerstone of all immunological theory.” In the category of nonself are such disease-causing organisms as viruses, parasites, fungi, and bacteria.. . Who created this marvelous cell? Such a thing can not come about by chance.  It has to come into existance by a creator.  Even your watch has a creator.  It did not come about from something else.

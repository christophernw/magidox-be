It's a stereotype that seems to draw attention to itself whenever it rings true.  There are many corrupt politicians, and there are many that are not.  Being a politician puts a person in the position to try and satisy everyone, and it's just not possible.  Humans err by nature, and when it happens that a politician errs, it's a major issue, because they serve such a large group of people. In no way am I condoning irresponsible political behavior, but the truth lies more in the fact that when a mistake is made, it is never forgotten, and the facts of the mistake are scrutinized so closely that many varying opinions and accusations arise.

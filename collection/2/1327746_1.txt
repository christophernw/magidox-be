You can equate it to the "Carrot and Stick" theory. If you hold the carrot far enough from the mules nose they keep following it in hopes of being able to eat it.. . Sanctions are similar in that you tell someone (a country) they can have the carrot (that is just a little out of reach), as soon as they do what you want.

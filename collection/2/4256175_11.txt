It sounds like you may have a condition. It's common to have this in the summer (d/t walking barefoot) you may have a fungus/athlete's foot type of thing.. . Try some bag balm or vaseline at night before bed & slip thick fuzzy socks on to seal in the warmth..if this doesn't help, it's time to go for the big guns like anti fungal stuff.. . . Hope this helps ~ good luck!

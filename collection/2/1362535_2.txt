For one thing we are never really sure what causes it.  Bell's Palsy is paralysis of the muscles innervated by the facial nerve (CN VII, not IV), usually on one side of the face (bilateral Bell's Palsy is rare and can be a sign of a serious intracranial problem).  It is believed to be the result of inflammation and/or injury to the nerve.  Often, it is believed to be the result of a herpes zoster flare (shingles).  Sometimes it may be result of physical or temperature injury to the nerve.  At a very early presentation (within 3 days), steroids can be used to decrease the inflammation of the nerve and "cure" it, but in most cases you just have to wait for it to resolve on its own.

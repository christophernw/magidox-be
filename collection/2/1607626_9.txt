In the medical profession to do a good job you need empathy. With it you put yourself in the place of the patient.  Therefore you imagine his pain, his fear etc.. Then you are an effective caregiver.. . Sympathy makes it too personal.  If a caregiver is always sympathizing it takes its toll on the caregiver and interferes with his ability to be therapeutic.. . The bottom line is a caregiver will burn out.  This also applies to anyone in the business of saving lives.  Firemen, cops, emts physical therapists and so on.

This is becoming increasingly common.  Please take the medication to the pharmacy where you picked it up.  Ask the pharmacist to pull the 'hard copy' of the prescription.  If the prescription was written correctly but filled incorrectly the pharmacist will correct the mistake and should offer you a very sincere apology.  If however the physician wrote the prescription incorrectly - and I am embarrassed to say that I have done this - then the physician should pay for the incorrect prescription and the new one and offer you a most sincere apology.

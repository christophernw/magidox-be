You need to go to the managers of your local Borders and Barnes & Nobles bookstores and speak with them about your book.  I travel, and on many occassions to  one of these bookstores have found myself amid a showcase of a local writer, with a reception and question and answers session.  So seek out how to do this and then invite a group of guests that will buy your book and maybe a couple of local bookclubs to get the word out and open people up to discussing your book.

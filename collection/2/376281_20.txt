Politics is exactly that: social interactions that involve deal making to acheive certain goals (passage or defeat of laws or bills).  In many cases, such "deal makings" involve degrees of personal blackmail.  . . Political figures all have on staff discreetly hired professionals who spy on other political figures in ways the FBI / CIA and Homeland Security could all learn new lessons in.. . If a political figure won't tow the party line, then his OR her (and there are a plenty), scandalous secrets are let out.

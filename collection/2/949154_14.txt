--------------------------------------------------------------------. a butler is like having a hotel manager for your home.. . he is there to make sure that the insurance salesman does not get through the door (and will never call again). your friend who got drunk at the party goes home in a taxi instead of driving. Will be ready with a scotch-and-water when you need one but make sure you don't have three when you have a business meeting later on. A source of wisdom, calm, discrete. Handles any problem before it becomes a catastrophe. Also see PG Woodhouse "Jeeves" stories

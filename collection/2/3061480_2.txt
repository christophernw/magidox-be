First you have to find the right dog breed for you(In your case a Yorkie), then you research as much about it and right a report on the computer saying in one pvaragraph all of the good reasons and benefits for having that dog. Then in the next paraghraph you say all of the things that are not so great aboit it(but try and leave out some of the worst). :) then before you show them your "Presentation", you find pictures of the cutest yorkies and put them in your "presentation". and also before you show your presentation" to them, do alot of searches on petfinder.com and other websites like that and have links and lists of yorkies that could work in your family. if you have any more questions, E-mail me.

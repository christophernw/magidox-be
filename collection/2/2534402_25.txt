You poor misguided simple creature. It was Osama Bin Laden, Afghanistan, and his thugs that ATTACKED THE U.S.A,THE WORLD TRADE CENTER ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. I cannot believe that you and others like you have already forgotten. Shame on you. And yet you follow the leader blindly, Stay the Course. You stand firmly behind your leader, claiming he is protecting us. That theory will only hold up as long as a new attack does not happen. . Please don't point your finger in the wrong direction to make your lame point. But if you must, just remember that three fingers point right back to you.

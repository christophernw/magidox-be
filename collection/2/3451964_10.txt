Generally a manual is more reliable and "sporty" when compared to an automatic, however a manual car will not necessarily outperform an automatic car, in fact, in drag racing a well built auto is often preferred over a manual, as it can shift quicker and more precisely than a human controlled manual.. . I'd take an auto with a good stall and a shift kit any day over a manual...just per her in D and go!

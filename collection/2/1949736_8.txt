A molecule requires active transport when its being accumulated against its electrochemical gradient, across some sort of membrane. This is usually coupled to another process which results in the release of free energy e.g. ATP hydrolysis or driven by a proton or sodium motive force. Typical examples include the accumulation of lactose by the proton symporter LacY across bacterial membranes.

Maybe they are in to much of an hurry, or they just don't care?  I don't think that we are being graded on our English here.  I know that I try to make sure everything is right just so I don't look like an idiot, but some people just don't care.  Assuming that people are ignorant just because the speed through, or just don't care about how their questions, or answers appear grammatically is just wrong though.  Who are you to judge?  If you don't like the way somebody asks a question then don't respond to it!

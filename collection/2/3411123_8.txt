I think maybe the question might be a little off.  In your particular position it might be true but in honesty in lots of positions such as doctors, they will usually be hired quicker than Americans as usually they will work cheaper although still making great wages.  Locally here, a J-1 doctor with no experience will hire in as soon as they enter the country for about 150K per year with another 100k in perks where an American doctor won't even consider an offer like that.  I saw a couple years back an American OBGYN hire in at a company with a 200K sign in bonus, $200K per year salary, 1/2 of the overall money she generated on top of that, $500/month cell phone allowance, and $700/month rental allowance.

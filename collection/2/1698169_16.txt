I think is was a huge mistake for them to start the Israeli state after WWII and the problems have escalated so that now there is no turning back.. . It would have been better for other nations to assimilate the people who were displaced in Europe rather than create Israel.. . In the Middle East everyone is wrong; no one is right.

One reason that parents are tired of their teens IS because they can't SPELL even with spell checker. It is "their parents".  . Trust me as a parent and a grandparent.  We are tired of you guys also.  Stand up, be grown up.  Do Your jobs. Behave in a respectable manner, so that when you are 25 you won't say " What was I thinking!!!' Stop putting tattoos on yourselves.  (they are ugly when you get old. Stop punching holes in yourselves.  Many companies will NOT hire people with obscene piercings.  AND YOUNG MEN, WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE YOUR UNDER WARE.  Please wear your pants at your waist.. And young women keep your body REASONABLY  covered, enticement only brings on date rape and pregnancy while you . are a teen.  You are a parent for a lifetime.  So use SERIOUS birth control, to avoid ruining your life at an early age. While you teens may find this ridiculious, someday you will realize how wise these words are.

It's not supposedly the celebration of Jesus' birth, that is precisely what it is.  I would say they're being hypocrites, but they want to convert Christmas into a secular holiday, and might say that they are merely celebrating "winter holiday" and not actually celebrating Christmas.. . If they are atheists and say they celebrating Christmas, then they are hypocrites.

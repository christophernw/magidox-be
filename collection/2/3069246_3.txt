Nature doesn't 'create' creatures to have a point.  The only purpose that any organism serves is to pass on its genetic heritage to its offspring.  Any adaptation or ecological niche that they can exploit to do this results in a successful organism.  By feeding parasitically on the blood of other animals, ticks are able to thrive, and produce lots of their offspring, and so the tick's 'purpose' is fulfilled.. . The fact that organisms exist that are vexatious, dangerous, or even completely and totally unnoticed by man provides some pretty compelling evidence that Earth was not created for the benefit of mankind.

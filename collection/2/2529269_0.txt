I am sure you are aware of this, but Marion Zimmer Bradley wrote Storms over Troy (At least, I think that is what it is called, I only read a translation in my own language) about the Trojan War, and the heroin of the book is Cassandra. It sort of tells the story through the eyes of the women. Very interesting, I thought, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were too girlie for a man, or maybe difficult to place yourself in the shoes of the heroin.

do meditation in the early morning for about half an hour. and then do not take any tension and the best way to get out of it is to laugh a lot by reading some jokes. try to be with child aged between 2-4. then you will forget your worries because children of this age are too interesting to observe. avoid taking salt and eat as much fruits as you can. try to increase the duration of your sleep.

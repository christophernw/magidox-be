Actually, you are generalizing.  We get used to our smells as they build up...this is mostly true of body odor.  This explains why some people stink to heaven and they don't notice it.  However, unless you poop roses, I wouldn't go as far as to say our own crap is not a bad smell.  It depends on what you ate and how your body dealt with it.

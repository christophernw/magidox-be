well i was told to pray. my mom and my teachers. I didnt listen carefully to them. It was like, please eat your soup or something like that.. . In times of desperation which I had, I pray. And I think I have recieved miracles. I really can't explain you the real power of praying. It is something real. I have recieved my life back, since I asked God. . The last achievment of my prays, was a detail, that might not mean that much to others but it is really special to me. . This men I was dating stoped talking to me, we were very distant, and I really didnt know what to do. He lives in other city. I went to a park where there is a virgin, hoping that will help. I asked for him, then I returned to my home, and forget about it. . Next day, he called me, and said, he had to visit me. We spent worderfull time together. I was looking at him, and couldnt believe. My parents, and my friends said me... you did pray right? it is so weird. God is so powerfull.... please believe me... I am a disco girl, with lots of problems, i go to the university, i am a common 22 years old girl, that have recieved miracles from praying.... Things so big as my life back, and this one...

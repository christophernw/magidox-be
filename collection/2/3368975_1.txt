Who forced you to stop kicking your dog?. And how come you would rather be cruel to it than kind to it?. And why do you want to be mean to dogs?. . Search for it online. It is there now.. . . That is called a "fallacy".. . When people use a fallacy to make an argument, when the facts will not support it or they don't feel like bothering to collect the facts and build a logical argument - that argument is called rhetoric.. . The only way to counter rhetoric is to point it out for what it is.  Or counter with more rhetoric.  Or both.. . Anyway, if your dog understands this then he can probably relax and stop worrying that you are going to hurt him.

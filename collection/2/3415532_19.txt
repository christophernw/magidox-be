It depends on who you talk to. I am offended by it only because I believe that if you are ever going to get married or want to get married that you wouldn't allow yourself to be so easily "turned on" by beautiful women. Porn and Strip clubs tend to be on the sleezy side. I wouldn't judge anybody for trying things because I'm not perfect.

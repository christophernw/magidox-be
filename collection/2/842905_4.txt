All you need to do is multiply the percentage you got correct by the percentage of weight allotted to the assignment, then add them all up.  If you have 100% of all assignments, and know all of their weights, you will get your total percentage grade for the class.  If you haven't done all the assignments yet, you'll get what your grade would be if you stopped all work for the course right now.

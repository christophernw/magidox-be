As mentioned, they don't technically sound Welsh but Scottish. If you perceive some similarity, perhaps it could be related to the fact that Welsh (Cymraeg) and Scots Gaelic (GÃ idhlig) are related languages? Though of course they're not soo closely related, being from different families of Celtic languages, they do have a lot of similarlities in the overall sound. . But do you mean that they sound similar when they speak English or when they speak (respectively) Welsh & Gaelic?

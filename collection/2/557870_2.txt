Ick! I hate spiders. I just...*skin crawls*...ok. To keep them out of my car I make sure my door isn't open for very long periods of time. I knock them off my side mirrors when they build webs there. I do a quick check of myself to make sure there aren't any on me. If infestation is a problem in your car, you may have a few egg sacks stashed somewhere *skin crawls some more*. At that point I would grab a can of Raid and start spider hunting in my backseat. for real.

Food is not properly fried with a cover.  Doing so prevents moisture from escaping, thus making it simmered or boiled rather than fried.  I do prefer to have a lid with my fry-pans because sometimes I like to brown, then reduce the heat for simmering.  Lids can be purchased separately,  although they do not always properly fit the pan.

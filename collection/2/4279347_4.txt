Teaching tricks is done the same way teaching sit is done because to your dog they're ALL tricks! But if you're still figuring out how to, then yes, do see if you can find a class. The key is finding a class where YOU learn how to teach your dog, rather than a trainer who teaches your dog directly. . . It's important no matter what you learn to show that you are happy and enthused when your dog does the right thing - whether it's housebreaking or sit or just getting their attention. Your dog wants to please you, and you need to be sure you use your happy voice and let him know you're pleased and proud of him. That way he immediately knows he's done the right thing. . . But a great place for you to start to learn to teach your dog is at a class at Petco or Petsmart. Another place you might look is at a class for dogs that want to compete at dog shows. They show you how to train your dog for a lot of different things, and are probably the best place to show you how to focus your dogs attention. . . Good luck - training is lots of fun for both you and your dog.

Contrast papers do just that--Contrast.  Talk about the differences in the two places.  Like the weather, the people, the things there were to do there (special attractions), geography, things like that.  How were those two places different?  Did you have a better time at one place than the other?  Would you go back to either place?  It's basically just a description of the places.  Hope this helps.

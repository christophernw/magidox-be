Rain water is good for plants. Put a barrel or bucket out to capture rain water, add a bit of bagged manure from the garden section,let it sit and use that water for your plants. They will grow spectacularly :). Tap water has been treated and lost all of it's natural minerals.. Well water is a very good water source also as it has all it's natural minerals.

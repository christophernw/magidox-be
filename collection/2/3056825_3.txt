It may depend on the State you are in, but I live in Georgia and in the white pages you go to the government listings for your county and it will have all the departments of the court systems, etc.  For my county there is a warrents division phone number.  I can call and ask them for the information with a Name and sometimes they ask for Social Securtiy Number.  Hope this helps and God Bless!

when you say "you yell at her or get on to her about it she pees on her self" - it makes me think she's terrified of you and peeing submissively at that point.  The WORST thing you can do to a submissive pee(er) is yell at her.  She's already telling you in dogspeak that she recognizes you're the alpha in the pack, and when you continue to yell, it just makes it worse.  In her mind, she's being as SUBMISSIVE AS POSSIBLE, so she doesn't understand why you're still yelling.. . IF she's going in her crate, the crate might be too large.  Make sure she eats and sleeps in the crate, and it's just large enough to stand up and turn around in.  Any bigger and there's a perfect potty spot in her mind.. . You could consider leash bonding with her - tie the leash to a belt loop, and lead her around when you're home, cooking dinner, watching TV, and watch for those telltale signs of potty time, then take her outside until she does her business - PRAISE the crap out of her (pun there, see?) and tell her what a good puppy she is.. . Also, she seems like she might be timid, not aggressive, so try to play games with her where she wins once in a while, like tug or something.  I recommend trying agility to build her confidence as well.  If there's no course in agility offered at your local training facility, make one in your own yard - the internet has wonderful directions on simple obsticles to make on your own.. . Smearing her face in it is a common rookie mistake.  Catching her in the act with a sharp "NO" works better than all the smacks and smears in the world.  This way, she knows EXACTLY what she did wrong. (eliminate in the house)  Praise her and treat her when she goes outside.. . If you need to, and it doesn't work at all, try returning her to the shelter so someone with more time could work with  her on this problem.

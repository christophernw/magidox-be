Early embryonic cells are meristematic ("stem") and not specialized to do anything in particular. As the embryo develops these cells specialize to perform various specific or specialized functions. Examples: Muscle cells-contraction/movement ; nerve cells-carry impulses ; epidermal cells-covering ; gland cells-secretions, etc..   There are several theories as to how these unspecialized cells specialize (or differentiate).

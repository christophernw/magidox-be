wow i do not know who fed you that line of bs but let me clarify  this for you. unless you lay there like a corpse sex is a very good work out. It raises you heartbeat boosts meabloism and in many cases makes you break a sweat. These are all things that make you burn calories which leadss to loosing weight! So go on out there and get your freak on w no worries! If sex made you fat then the whole world would be full of alot of fat people!!!!

Well, that is an interesting question. But please understand that God makes new all things. I despise the act that occurred on that day. Many people died, because some TERROR organization brought it upon themselves to kill innocent people(with families, friends, daughters, sons). God, hasn't given all the answers. But He does tell us this.. . 1) that ALL things work together for good for those that love Him and are called according to his purpose.. . 2) That without testing we do not grow. Even a vine must be pruned to become more full. Gold must be melted down and processed to make a more pure Gold. . . 3)and that testing works patience so that we become stonger, better people. . . God did not cause 9-11 to occur, YES He did allow to occur, why I do not know. I will ask Him when I see Him. But I will tell you that God does not rule this world. . . Satan is called the god of this world. Lucifer takes strife and multiplies it in an attempt to confuse people. Satan uses circumstances to destroy people, to cause pain.. . God redeems all things. Makes all things new. Only God can restore what the locust destroyed. God will restore everthing in His time, at the right time. . . Dont let life make you bitter. There is still good in the world. There is the laughter of children, the gentle rolling of water in the streams and rivers. The powerful crashing of the waves on the beach. The mighty roll of thunder across the plains. And more importantly, there are people that love you. . . God is not powerless, nor has He forgotten you. He knows where you are in life and He understands the pains and trials you face.. . God is always there for you, no matter the things that come your way. He loves you for who you are and nothing can change that. He sees beauty in you, He sees a masterpiece. What you did, do, and will do, do; don't matter to Him. The only thing that He wants is for you to trust Him.. . And now, I pose a question. Are you going to trust Him?. . God bless you friend

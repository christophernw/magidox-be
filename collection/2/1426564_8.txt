I always eat hotdogs on Fridays...and I'm Catholic...and its called Good Friday(check the calendar)...we don't eat meat on that day(14 years and above) because its our way of sacrificing and abstaning from all the pleasure in the world and repent for our sins in the memory of the last day the Lord has lived...

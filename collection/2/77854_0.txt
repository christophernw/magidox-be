The Swiss Guards are Catholics- it's a requirement.. . They have guarded the Vatican for something like 500 years- a regiment was sent from Switzerland, and many of them died defending the Pope when the Vatican was attacked.  To honor them, the Pope instituted them as the official guards of the Vatican.. . They are celebrating the 500th anniversary this year....you should be able to Google it and get some neat tidbits.

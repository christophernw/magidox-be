Umm.. Isn't faith suppose to have some real and true facts about it?  The bible at least has some factual basis for some of what is in it, such as the places mentioned, they have been proven to be real, the book of Mormon can't even do that.  Faith needs some kind of factual basis for it to stand not nothing.

if you are going north-by-northwest, you are traveling along a direction that is midway between north and northwest.  similarly, if you are going west by northwest, you are traveling along a direction that's midway between west and northwest.  it just gives you a little more "resolution" when specifying your direction.. . and yes, it is also a famous hitchcock movie, starring cary grant.. . if a wind is blowing from west to east, that is an easterly wind.

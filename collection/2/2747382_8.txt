Remember that every mistake has something to learn from with it. John Maxwell said "while you are down pick something up." Everyone of us makes mistakes and it is ok... the people who don't say that they do are not being truthful, and those who make few and criticize others for their mistakes are probably timid souls who are not doing or risking much. If you are making mistakes you are doing something, involved, and that is good because in the long run you will gain greatly. And trust in God to help you, because he wants to be with you through everything and make you your best in all things that happen.

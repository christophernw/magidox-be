Organized crime and drug trafficking are synonomous.. In today's drug trafficking everyone involved will eventually come under the control of organized crime,although drug trafficking is at its inception organized crime unto its own.. Organized crime, drug trafficking, and political protection are a scourge within our society that needs to be eliminated by each and every one of us.. Identify, report, and destroy, Aye!  Jose

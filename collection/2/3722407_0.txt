You are so correct. Unforunately, we are now so spoiled and adjusted to getting where we need to go in an expediant manner, and sub-consciously take the risk of loss of life every day, that it would take an extreme act of God to bring us back to the simpler way of life.. However, like Ghandi said, "be the peace that you want to see in the world." Even if you stand alone, you are making a strong stand.

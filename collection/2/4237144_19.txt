In the early days, people believes that your soul will leave your body if you sneeze.. . How or why did saying "God bless you" become associated as an expression one says to another after the other sneezes? Some reasons listed below, but, somehow, I don't think any of them are very legitimate:. . * When someone sneezes his heart stops and saying "God bless you" means "I'm glad your heart started again.". * Saying "God bless you" when you sneeze keeps the devil from flying down your throat.. * When someone sneezes, say "God bless you and may the devil miss you.". * When you sneeze your soul tries to escape and saying "God bless you" crams it back in (said by Millhouse in an episode of The Simpsons).

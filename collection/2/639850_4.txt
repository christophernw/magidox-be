It is not just an American thing!!! Women all over the world are matrialistic cos thats the way the world has become. It is in a woman's nature to love material things like fancy cars, diamonds, shoes and expensive perfumes cos women are more conscious about their outer being than men. There is nothing wrong with liking a fancy lifestyle as long as u dont expect a man to pay for it. And a saying i ve heard from women again and again is that 'all men are jerks, so I might as well go out with a rich jerk."

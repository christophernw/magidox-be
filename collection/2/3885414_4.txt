Social conditioning. We've been lead to believe that money equals happiness. And wealth does give you financial freedom. If you think it is weird that people today want to be rich, think of how weirder it was for people 1000 years ago who wanted a pile of gold that just sat there. At lease today you can trade it for something fun.

Kerry`s statements just prove the how the Democrats are uninformed and have true contempt for the Military.. . 1.The Military is better educated than the general population. . 2.The Military is all volunteer. . 3. One can not join without a minimum of a high school degree.. 4. 73.3 percent of the Enlisted Military have some college, 16.2 percent have an associate’s degree or equivalent semester hours, and 4.7 have a bachelor’s degree. 85 percent of officers have advanced degrees – 70.7 percent have master’s degrees, 12.1 percent have professional degrees and 2.5 percent have doctorate degrees.. 5. Dropouts can not get in the Military. They have to go to Mc Donalds.. 6. Bush out performed with better grades Kerry in the same school and Bush went further.. 7. There is no draft that takes underachieving kids out of school and sends them to war, that was the Vietnam war.. 8. Kerry was talking to students about education.. . So Kerry`s joke doesn`t fit and he was stating what he believed about a Military he has contempt for. The "Joke" was damage control for the gullible.. Senator McCain wants an apology too.

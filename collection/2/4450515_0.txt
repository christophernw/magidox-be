You put heavy whipping cream in a kitchen aid mixer, Add a little bit of vanilla flavoring 1tsp and 1/4 cup of powder sugar. Turn the mixer on  and it will only take a min or so. you can also use an electric hand mixer and a mixing bowl. You can add more or less vanilla and sugar to taste. . . If you don't add any sugar it will taste nasty. Also I have used coffee syrup flavorings like hazelnut too.

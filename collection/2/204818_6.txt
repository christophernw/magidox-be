It depends on the age of the scars, there are pressure bandages that might help but you'll have to speak with a pharmacist or doctor or google it. Chances are you'll just have to live with them.. . Don't pay attention to people who try to make you feel stupid or bad. You need to build up your self-esteem and resolve your issues, not to be made feel even worse for a recognised medical condition that requires medical intervention rather than mindless critisism by people who have never studied this or suffered from it.

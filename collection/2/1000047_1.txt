A businesslike attitude, where you focus on the task at hand, leads to a more dynamic workplace, where a more casual attitude, including gossiping and taking care of personal matters is less productive.  If you have a confrontational attitude, whether it be in customer relations or with coworkers, you could see bruised egos and a lessened achievement of desired results.

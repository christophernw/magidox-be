Here is the honest, professional truth. It is because of liberals. They think everyone can be rehabilitated and doesn't want anyone to be hurt physically or emotionally. So they push to have all penalties to be the absolute lowest without letting them go free, which happens as well. Instead of protecting the victims they focus on the criminal and how best to handle them without infringing on their rights while forgetting the rights of the victims. Liberals want to hug the criminals and tell them everything is ok and they'll be fine. Now, I said liberals NOT democrats because not all dems feel this way.

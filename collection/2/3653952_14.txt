First, can Americans actually read history?. . Yes, the confederate flag is a symbol of the confederacy.. . It's all about states' rights.  Especially not have the states of the north force their will on the states of the south.  The north wanted to stay together.  The south wanted to get out of the sandbox, take their toys home, and make their own play area.. . Race didn't become an issue until well into the war.. . Now does this mean that all cofederate waving yahoos are not racists?  Nope.  . . I figure that rednecks can drop the confederate flag when blacks drop black power flags, hispanics drop mexican flags, and gays drop rainbow flags.. . The next time you see a confederate flag, instead think of how stupid we are as Americans.  Where in the heck does it even say anything about seperation of church and state in the constitution?  Look it up people.  It was in a letter..... after the fact.

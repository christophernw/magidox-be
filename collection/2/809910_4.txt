Its a kind of mirror that is curved outside, or you can call it a fat mirror if you want to. Side-mirrors fitted in cars are convex mirrors. You must have seen that it is written, "OBJECTS IN THE MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR", in some of the side-mirrors of cars and bikes.. When you stand in front of one, you will see that the image on the mirror become fat or are formed like a bow shaped from outside.

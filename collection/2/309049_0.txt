I truly feel that if we all banned together as a "family" ... teachers and parents to alleviate "bad" behavior, it will help kids to grow up knowing that there will be circumstances or punishment for things that they do wrong.  Society has gotten too soft in my opinion ... that's why more and more children are growing up without caring what they do in society, like lying, cheating and stealing.

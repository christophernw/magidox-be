unless you are a professional photographer, you really don't NEED one.  You WANT one.  If you do not have a DSLR and the next purchase would be a DSLR then I could see it, because the point-and-shoots are very limiting in what you can and cannot do with them.. . If you have a decent income then I would say -- if you want it, buy it and wait for her to ask.

These are the things that almost always help me. Try to do them  before your migraine gets any bigger. First, I will take a hot shower and I will stay in there until either i can't stand the heat, or the hot water runs out.. Then, I will sit in a recliner  because if you lay down it will get worse. I will put a heating pad on the spot on my head (don't make it too hot) and drink 2 glasses of water. Then i will sleep in the recliner. . This should at least ease the pain.. You can repeat the steps as needed.

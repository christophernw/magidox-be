the most common reason give my the supporters of the death penalty is that it acts as a detterent to the heinous crime. though some of the persons bitterly oppose that saying that if at some later stage the person who has been convicted turns out to be innocent, we can't give his life back to him (i too have the same feeling). yet, in some cases, i think the capital punishment is justified and the court of law include such cases into rarest of the rare cases. for example in case of masood azhar who was in prision when his supporters hijacked the plane and took it to kandhar airport thus ensuring his release. now he planned the bomb blasts and that resulted in death of about 100 persons and many more were handicapped. in such cases, when u see the condition of the persons who suffered bcoz of such persons and terrorists, u feel like he shouldn't have ever been captured rather encountered. but still it's a controversial topic, with it's own merits and demerits.

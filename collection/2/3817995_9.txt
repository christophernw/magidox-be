Call the Office of Border Patrol in Washington D.C. and tell Chief David V. Aguilar to allow his agents to do their jobs.  Right now these agents have their hands tied behind their backs.  They are damned if they do and damned if they don't.  With the way that Agents are treated by their own agency it is no wonder that they have such a difficult time getting people to apply, and a more difficult time getting them to stay once they are hired.  Call 202-344-2050.  Also call you Representative in Washington and tell them that you are tired of the invasion.

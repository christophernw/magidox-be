I like them just fine.  I live a block away from the police department and I'm an on call interpreter.  Before those two things I never had any contact with cops.  I see/talk with them all the time.  Guess what?  They're people too! They have a sense of humor, get tired/crabby etc. just like the rest of us.  They're just doing their jobs.  If you have a problem with cops, I'd bet you're less than a model citizen.

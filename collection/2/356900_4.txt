Reverse engineering (RE) is the process of discovering the technological principles of a mechanical application through analysis of its structure, function and operation. . . That involves sometimes taking something (a mechanical device, an electrical component, a software program, etc.) apart and analyzing its workings in detail, usually with the intention to construct a new device or program that does the same thing without actually copying anything from the original.

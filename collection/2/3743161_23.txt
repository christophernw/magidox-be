Bush can't really control the gas prices, and if it were up to him they would be lower, believe me, because it would probably improve his approval ratings.  . Gas prices are going up because of (among other things) the yearly summer increased demand for fuel; hurricane Katrina, from which gulf coast refineries have still not completely recovered; increased political instability in the Middle East; and increased worldwide gas consumption caused by industrialization and larger middle classes in China and India.

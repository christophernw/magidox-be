Im german also and i know where you are coming from, every country or ethnic backround has there problems in history, dont stress it at least you can say well i know there is a good possiblity my relitives distant or not did this but it wasnt ME personally and more then likely it wasnt them who personally did it eather. Maybe they just dont want to hear about it and they do say if you dont know history your doomed to repeat it. Let their ignorance be to their fault if they want to put their head in the sand so be it.... but at least your willing to stand up and say yes this happened. People that want to act like they are perfect their race or haritige is perfect just arnt worth wasting your time on. :)

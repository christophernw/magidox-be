If you own a business, do what we did.   Invest in a non-profit org.  We use a 501 (c) 3 which allows us to have the charity give us money that we use to invest in our business.  Check out how we did it by logging on to < gifoundation.org> or call (402) 934-5800 and ask for Jim or Michelle Henry or e-mail us at kotsch@cozadtel.net.

Currently, nobody knows what lies beyond the observable universe (as far back in time/space as astronomers can see with e.g. the WMAP project [see link]), but there are many speculations as to what could lie beyond the universe such as more space (an infinite universe), another universe (the "multiverse"), or even "God" (usually answered by religious or metaphysical persons). By the definition of the universe (without the modifier "observable"), the universe is that space which contains all matter/energy known to exist.

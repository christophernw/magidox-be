In the U.S. there are 3 firms (Equifax, Experian and Transunion) who collect the credit transactions of all Americans.  Businesses use these agencies to determine the credit worthiness of people who apply for credit cards, mortgages etc.  These firms develop a credit score for each person that is based on that persons history of on time or late payment of their bills.  . . If you have a low credit score you  may be denied credit or may pay a higher rate of interest. Recently the U.S. Congress passed a law that requires these firms to give their information to each American (upon request) annually at no cost.  The FREE information does not include your credit score but does include detailed information on all of your credit transactions and your record of payments. . . Call 800 685 1111 and ask how to get your FREE report.  Phone is better than the WEB since most sites will lead you to getting your score and there is a charge for that.

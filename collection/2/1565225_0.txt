Yes there are two waves.. . One is due to eclectic field and another due to magnetic field.. . The electric field is perpendicular to magnetic field.. . When electric field is zero, the magnetic field is zero.. When the eclectic field is the maximum, the magnetic field is also the maximum.. When electric field is again zero, the magnetic field is again zero.. When the eclectic field is negative- maximum, the magnetic field is also the negative-maximum maximum.. . Thus the two fields are ‘in-phase’; but one is perpendicular the other.. . To visualize them, imagine any one wave and simply rotate it about its direction of motion to get the other.. . However we can ignore any one wave for any motion and consider the wave motion as either electric or magnetic, because the other one will always be there.

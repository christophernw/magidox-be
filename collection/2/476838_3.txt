Beats me.  I typed in the word on Freetranslation.com... and got nothing.. Did you perhaps mean "Marquee"?. A marquee is a sign that can be used to advertise a place, or a sale, etc.  They are used outside a place of business most of the time. The letters can be changed as needed. There are also marquee with LED displays & custom illuminated cabinets.. Hope this helps.

Feces eating in dogs is called "corophagia".  . . Female dogs often clean up the poop of their pups and other dogs when they're nursing litters of pups to keep their nesting area clean and tidy but this behavior usually ends when the pups are about 4 weeks old.. . Some dogs eat feces because they're lacking trace minerals in their diet.  A trip to the vet for a blood work up will let you know if there are any elements your dog may need.. . Some dogs eat feces because they like the taste.. . Besides the powder and pills that can be put on the dog's food, or given to the dog directly, which make the feces unpalatable, the only other way to stop the behavior is with strict monitoring and correction.. . Take the dog out on a leash to do its business, and whenever it looks like it's heading for a feces-snack, give it a firm but calm command (we use "no dirt" on our dogs) and manuever the dog away from the feces.  You will also need to immediately clean up any feces in your yard, so it's not around to tempt the dog (and stink up your yard).  . . You may have to continue this "behavior modification" training for a week or two to rid your dog of its desire to eat "ick".

my kitten did this for about 4 days.. you cant make the kitten come out.. he will come out when he is ready.. until then make him more comfortable by pulling his food and water under the bed and put the litter box by the bed so he wont get lost on his way to find the litter! then when he gets more comfotable around your house move all the food and liitter to the right places

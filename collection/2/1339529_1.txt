Probably the question that most people ask is, Why doesn't my cat go pee in the toilet?  Perhaps the litter box is dirty, or it doesn't like the smell of it or perhaps it likes the smell of the toilet.. . Congratulations anyway, we tried potty training ours once in and was successful with one cat, but not the other so it really wasn't successful.

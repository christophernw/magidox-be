Man, you have a what? it can't cover 60% no way. It may be big but not that big. If it's even ten percent of this you'd better get to an ER right now to have it drained before it moves. If that thing moves or spawns smaller clots they can move to you heart causing a fatal heart attack, to the lungs causing collapse and death, to the brain causing a stroke. Do you hear me? I wouldn't worry about prices and get going..   You may even end up in a hospital until it's gone, something like this is fatal sir. The hospital will not turn you down. Worry about paying for it later.

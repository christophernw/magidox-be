There is no cure for a common cold.  You can make yourself more comfortable by drinking hot tea with lemon and honey. Take Vitamin C and eat well to help your body fight the cold.  I also suggest heating your body up right before laying down by drinking hot tea, or eating warm soup then cover up with warm covers and you will see that your body will heat up.  This is your bodys way of fighting infections, thats why we get temperatures when we have infections like ear infections, throat infections, etc. IF you indulge and depend too much on cold medication you are not relying on your bodys own strength and your immune system will then become dependent on cold medication for healing.  I never take cold medicine and when I get a cold it never last long at all. I'm a mother of 4 children I have lots of experience with this kind of stuff.

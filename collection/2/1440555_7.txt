Yea, in the U.S.A., they are thought of as the minority because they ARE the minority in most cases.  In the government, they are the minority.  In many colleges, they are still the minority.  Even in Hollywood, I think they are the minority.. . The majority makes up more than the minority.  100 years ago, Caucasions were overwhelmingly the majority.  They still are today (as far as I know), and that is why other races (Asian-Americans, African-Americans, Hispanics) are considered minority races.  But the numbers aren't as drastically different as they were in the past, and we are progressing towards a more even distribution in our country (of race).

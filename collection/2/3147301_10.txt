The only thing we have control of in this life is our own actions. We cannot control the actions of others. If that person wants to be a total jerk, that's his/her choice. You have a choice as to what you do in response to it. Understanding that can be powerful. When I feel bad about something someone did to me I try to remember a quote from Eleanor Roosevelt. She said, "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent."  If someone insults you, try not to let their words make you doubt yourself. Know how good and valuable you are. Then do your best to walk away from him/her. It's hard sometimes, but you'll eventually feel a sense of satisfaction with how you handle it.

goodness, there are so many possible reasons: overcrowding, hight ammonia levels, not enough filtration going, overfeeding and on and on.  it's a process of elimination to figure out what's going on.. . is this a new aquarium or an established one?. you're not overfeeding, are you?. temp is in the mid-70's, correct?. are you running adequete filtration?. how is pH, ammonia and nitrates?  have you tested for them?. . this is just an easy tik-off list to point you in the right direction.  good luck!

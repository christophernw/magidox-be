Nothing, exactly. Each manufacturer gives thier own meaning to a given trim level. SE usually is a higher trim level on most cars, but some models have even higher trim levels. With the US automakers there are designations that you can be pretty sure are the highest (R/T for Dodge, SS for chevy, GT for Ford) but even at that, it's not 100% (the Shelby Mustangs were higher-end than the Mustang GT, for example.) The only way to really know is to find the breakdown for your particular model of car, from your particular year. You could go to http://www.kbb.com and look up a used car value. when you do that it will give you all of the trim levels available that year, and you can see which are a little more gussied up.

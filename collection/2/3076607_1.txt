In my opinion, Call of Duty + United Offensive is the most realistic fps ever; I've played a lot of games, just to mention Half-Life 2, FEAR, Quake 4, Far Cry, Doom 3, Chronicles of Riddick or Call of Duty 2, but, believe me, none have impressed me the way Call of Duty did. I'm playing Black on PS2 right now, looks good, but not that good.

Love yourself first.  Focus on ALL the GOOD THINGS THAT IS IN YOU.  Appreciate your life, take time to give yourself a break.  Start doing sports, hobbies and anything that you like.. . As soon as the feeling of happiness and security sink in, you will automatically start loving the world around you.. . (If you find it hard to do, write everything down and paste it in your  bedside.)

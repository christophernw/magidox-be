In any process, the total energy of the universe remains constant.     . . An important law of physics, the second law of thermodynamics, states that the total entropy of any isolated thermodynamic system tends to increase over time, approaching a maximum value. Unlike almost all other laws of physics, this associates thermodynamics with a definite arrow of time.. . (The entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. For example, an air conditioner cools the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air. However the heat involved in operating the air conditioner always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air. Thus the total entropy of the room and the environment increases, in agreement with the second law.)

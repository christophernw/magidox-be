No,it's not the above,most of the time! You say that someone is "lerdo"(it's not a very nice thing to say)when this person is not quick when doing something or thinking.But not stupid or moron,it's not that bad!You could say(again,not very nicelly)that a friend or a family member is "lerdo",but you wouldn't call them "moron",would you?Got it?. Have a nice day!. Moon :)

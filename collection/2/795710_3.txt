Some of the answers you've gotten confirm your concerns about the general ingorance that results in bigotry. One person told you to 'suck it up' and actually referred to the "war" that our silly president has conjured up- the war against imaginary threats and financial motives. I will leave these points out since it's hard for alot of people to fathom the reality of it.. . What you are saying is accurate. I may not be Muslim but I do have the sense to realize that there are unfair criticisms of the religion and the people. There is false information that is propagated widely and used as an excuse (as some answerers did) for targetting this group and, as a result, taking away their rights to practice their religion. How ironic.

The Statue of Liberty is located in New York Harbor, about 1.6 miles (2.6 km) southwest of the southern tip of Manhattan. The island was officially called "Bedloe's Island" until it was renamed in 1956, but was popularly called "Liberty Island" much earlier;[1] O. Henry refers to it by that name in a 1911 story.[2]. . Lady Liberty holds a torch in her right hand and a tablet in her left. The tablet shows the inscription JULY IV MDCCLXXVI—July 4, 1776, the date of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence.. . One of her feet stands on chains, symbolizing the acquired freedom. The seven spikes in the crown represent the seven seas and seven continents.[3]. . The height from ground to the top of the torch is 305 feet (93 m); this includes the foundation and the pedestal. The height of the statue itself, from the top of the base to the torch, is 151 feet (46 m). The statue weighs 204 tons and the pedestal weighs 24,500 tons.[4][5] The statue was built from thin copper plates hammered into wooden forms through a process known as repoussé.[6][7] The formed plates were then mounted onto a steel skeleton.

Eating chocolate releases chemicals similar to that released when u fall in love; to overcome addiction u need to understand the cause behind it; is it a recent phenomenon? have u always been into it? Set a daily quota for chocolate; come what may, do NOT exeed; view it a form of indulgence, a prize for urself.

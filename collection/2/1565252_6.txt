According to general Christian doctrine, Christians aren't bound by any spiritual or biblical laws.. . Christians are taught that all people are evil and there's nothing to be done about it.. . And God (pretended to) killed himself so some evil people could go to heaven, and some could not, based entirely on an arbitrary decision to follow the teachings of some guy claiming to speak for God.

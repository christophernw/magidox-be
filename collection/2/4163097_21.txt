I think it's stupid that the first people to tell everyone else how to feel about statements concerning the poor and under-educated are all rich and have masters degrees. I'm tired of leaping out of the water and biting whatever bait CNN throws at me.. . Would you like to know what's even more insulting than words? When they come back from Iraq, the number of soldiers approved for disability will decrease by over one-in-ten, because nobody with a concluded rating of 10% or less will qualify for VA care any longer. . . If a paraplegic returns from Iraq and applies for VA, we will likely be given a rating of 50%, because he is still fit for desk work. He will receive less than 800 a month, and will only be covered under VA care directly concerning his lost legs. A typical Purple Heart recipient receives a grand total of 20% or 30%.. . My husband is a 100% service connected disabled Navy Veteran, and if he had money when he graduated, he wouldn't have contracted the 18th year of his life out at the end of the first Iraqi theater of operations. Make sure you address your thumbs down to my husband's local VA billing rep, so he can queue them into his monthly prescription regimen.

Somewhere it is going to cost you money.  You will have to pay transport to go out to do court searches, drivers license search, check with police and others.  And some of these will cost you a bribe or two, police, bank clerk, finance institution - whatever!!  So it cannot be done "for free".. Remember this IMPORTANT rule.  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.

I once found my muse from a painting of a bunch of dogs (not playing poker) in a Bed Bath & Beyond store.  It ended up in me producing one of the biggest portraits I'd done.. . Go to the nearest Museum of Modern Art and spend six hours looking.  Then go look at books with big pictures of renaissance paintings.  Then look at ancient egyptian art.  Then go look at the engine in an Enzo Ferrari (preferrably one that's not in two pieces).  Look at stainless steel.  Your hands.  Pictures of windows.. . You find your muse by looking at stuff that inspires you.  You'll know you've found it when you feel like you did as a kid on Christmas morning.  You won't be able to get it out fast enough.. . Have fun and good luck!

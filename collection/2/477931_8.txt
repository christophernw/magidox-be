NEither...I`m an Indonesian and also a Moslem...I really had the impact on both countries to my country. Australiajust gave a temporary visa to 43 Papua people. FYI...they have enough and quite prosper live in Papua. MAybe they`re poor but that`s only because they didn`t get enough education which they refused to have. While USA...with their Exxon Mobile just taken control of Cepu, an area with ots and lots of Oil inside. . I think both countries just thinking abiut wealth not prosperity...both taken other countries sovereignity, especially my country. . As a person who still hold on religious belief, i think both countries doesn`t realize that everything in this world won`t last forever. And there`ll be judgement day for everyone of us.

They compress the sound.  It helps squeeze more speech into a time slot.  It also gives a stronger, richer sound.  When they record it, it is on normal settings, but when they compress it for broadcast that increases the intensity of the sound.  That makes it louder, even though the broadcasters lie and say it wasn't (they know it is, though "technically" it isn't).

Neutrogena makes a body wash with salicylic acid that will help clear them up.  You might also want to use a loofah or another type of sponge to help exfoliate and help fresher skin emerge.  If money is not a problem, Proactiv is wonderful (I use their face products) and I know they make a wash and lotion just for acne on the body.  Good Luck.

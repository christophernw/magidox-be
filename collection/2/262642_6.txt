Hi there.. . . You can not burn it directly from limewire... but here are a few steps to follow..... . 1.  Open up your normal burning software.. 2.  Open up your c drive.. 3.  Look in your documents and settings. 4.  Then in the shared file.. . there you will find were all the downloads that you did.  from there you can burn it.  . . Now... if you want you burn it not in MP3 format, but in WAV (so you can listen to them in any CD palyer) you can use your windows media player.  Find the files the same way as above.  Select the burn tab, and it will convert them for you.. . Hope that helps

The Patriot Act has not made me less free... the government doesn't have time nor interest in tapping my phones or knowing what library books I check out.  But there hasn' been one terrorist attack in the US since it passed.  Have you directly been affected or had your rights taken away but the Patriot Act (and if so, are you a terrorist?  FYI, if so, I don't care).

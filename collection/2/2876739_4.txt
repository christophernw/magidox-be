I think you are suppose to get pissed off with the counselor,and then kiss and make up!!Take a deep breathe.Re-new your vows there is nobody else out there that is going to answer all your problems.Write down 5 things you like about each other and 5 thins you don't like about each other and then sit in front of each other and share.Good Luck!!! LOVE CONQUERS ALL!!!

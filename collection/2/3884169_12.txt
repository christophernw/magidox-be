Find out what time the services are and then drop in maybe 5-10 minutes before it starts. If you're comfortable there, go back next week. Otherwise, try another one. There are many simular denominations out there...find one that you like.  Once you find a church with a worship service you like, make sure that you agree with their beliefs/doctrine. Email me if you want to continue this discussion! I'll pray for you.

I have to laugh...sorry but I know what your going thur. I have one chihuahua  & she is a hand full so I can just imagine what your going thru  she barks at everything too..it drives us crazy  ...but I ususally spray her with water with a water bottle  all I have to do is show it now & she stops barking.......... as for being bad well they are playing ... so they think. you just need to be more stern when you say NO & mean it. hopefully they will catch on  but in the mean time enjoy your two bundles of joy......

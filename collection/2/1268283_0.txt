Because we have a conscience.  Unfortunately the Christians just don't understand it.  It is that sick feeling you get in your stomach when you are buying a bunch of stuff that you have no evidence for.  And, when anyone comes around and tries to talk to them about it, that sick feeling gets bigger and instead of re-evaluating their position they blame the sick feeling on your Satanic influence.

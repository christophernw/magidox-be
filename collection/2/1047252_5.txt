Exactly what fishball said.  Plus money breeds education and most of the money was in the north.  Carnagie, Rockefeller to name two.  The rich people funded universities in the north to educate their children.  People in the south don't have discrestionary money for higher learning and poverty runs in generations.  If grandfather is illiterate, he's not going to think that education is so important.  His child might get a basic education but that child will not have the same appreciation for education and might not make his or her child go to school when the child doesn't feel like it.  On the other hand, up north, Grandfather went to Yale so his children and grandchildren get admitted to Yale unless they're idiots.  They get tutors when they struggle with a subject.  Education is a priority.  These are just a couple of examples.  There's much more to it.

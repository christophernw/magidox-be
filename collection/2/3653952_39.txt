Because supposedly, in the US, there is freedom of expression.  Why do Americans ignorantly get called "racists" just for wanting to fly the confederate flag, but nothing is said about people that come to the US from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, etc and REFUSE to fly the AMERICAN flag, but fly the flag of the country they claim "oppressed" them so much? . . I think when it comes to people wanting to overthrow the American government, there is more to fear from people that spit on the US by waving flags of other countries, some that are not exactly "friendly" with the US.

I consider myself a liberal, and I have never, and I mean never, called anyone "gay" or "fag" or anything like that. Yes, its true, there are idiots everywhere. Not all liberals will call you gay for disagreeing, but some will. Granted. But surely you must recognize that there are morons of that exact same caliber amongst the conservative ranks as well?. . .

In california it is pretty easy. The sales tax is 7.5 or so, so you just double the sales tax which equals 15%.. . When the waiter or waitress sucks, I usually go with only 10% and if the service was really really bad I leave a quarter on the table so they know.. . If I have one drink at a bar I typically gowith 1$. . hope this helps you

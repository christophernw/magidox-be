Fans generate three kinds of stimulation: sound, touch and temperature.  The "white noise" of a fan probably masks other noises in your environment, and allows you to relax and release your mental focus.  The moving air gives the same constant tactile sensation to exposed skin . . . and may mask smells in your environment (pets, laundry,etc.).  And the temperature.  When you are alert, your body temperature is warmer than when you sleep.  Being cooled by the fan simulates the state of already being asleep . . . allowing you to relax.  On the downside, fans can chill you and cause muscle spasms . . . so you shouldn't sleep with a fan blowing directly on you.

well,here is the answer:. *gel:is an apparently solid,jelly-like material formed from a colloidal solution,by weight,gels are mostly liquid,yet they behave like solids,an example is gelatin,many gels display thixotropy-they become fluid when agitated,but resolidify when resting,by replacing the liquid with gas it is possible to prepare aerogels,materials with exceptional properties like very low density,very high surface area, and excellent thermal insulation properties.. . *paste:In physics,a paste is a substance that behaves as a solid until a sufficiently large load or stress is applied, at which point it flows like a fluid,it consists of a suspension of small particles in a background fluid.

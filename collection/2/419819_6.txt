I'm often tempted to simply tell the truth ... I don't like children. Never did, not even when a child myself. But to answer your question :). . First, the reason you feel so uncomfortable is because you are embarrassed for these people; they are being incredibly RUDE. While it's OK to ask people IF they are married or IF they have children, asking "why not" is over the top.. . My standard rejoinder to personal questions of any type is "Why do you ask?". If they can manage some sort of answer to that ... "I'm concerned" or "I'm nosey" or whatever, I politely tell them that I appreciate there concern, but would prefer that they not trouble themselves on my account.. . Notice that I didn't provide any information whatsoever to the Nosey Parker?

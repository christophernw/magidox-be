There are different kinds of fat. Saturated fat and Trans fat are horrable for you. Trans fat you actually aren't supposed to eat at all, while you can eat saturated fat in moderation. Polyunsaturated fat, and Monunsaturated fat is good fat. Polyunsaturated fat lowers both the good and bad cholesterol in your body.

Once upon a time, prejudice of the Jewish race was pretty common.  That included keeping them out of many markets[ways to make a living] then came the movie business, many people felt it would be a total failure...a flash in the pan, so it was a business Jews could get into without hassle.  So in the beginning movie production was pretty much left out of the white bread world. Hence a lot of Jewish ownership.

THANKS A LOT EVERYONE!!!!I cant tell you guys how bad this static electricity problem has been with me,i have been shocking any and everyone around me,even my girlfriend is scared to kiss me on some days when it is really bad.I think the resistor idea is the best and should work,will try it ASAP,tried evrything else till now,all the others r temporary,the only problem is that there is no permanent cure for it all of these r temporary methods and too to only reduce it and none of these can help prevent it permanently.nevertheless THANKS A LOT to everyone who has contributed.

the easiest thing to do is to put a spoon in a freezer during the night. it sounds dumb, but it will mold the shape of your eye(the spoon) and all you have to do is get up in the morning and rest the spoon under your eyes for a few minutes. the coldness will calm the swelling and reduce puffiness. trust me!

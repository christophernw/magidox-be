It is a totally new environment,and new people for her. I agree with the man who said be patient with her. Just make sure you have good clean water,and keep dry food for her all the time.I only feed my cats canned once a day. It is not too good to give them too much canned food,better for their teeth to have the solid food. Just call her,and be patient with her. When my son,and his children stayed with us for a month my female cats stayed hid out in the garage. As soon as they moved out,the girls came back out. It just takes them time to adjust to a new environment. I hope you have another cat,or dog to keep her company when your gone. All animals do better,and eat better when they have a companion. She sounds like a lovely cat.

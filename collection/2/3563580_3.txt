I don't know who you are referring. But here is my two cents.. . Many questions that are being asked are not being asked. They are being stated as "The bible says this, the bible is right because I believe it is. Please respond." That is not a question, because if you happen not to believe in the New Testament (or Old for that matter), then you either respond that the question is jibberish or with an answer that can't be supported in your realm of facts.. . And oh, according to the other holy roller who answered this question. Mahatma Gandhi is a satanist and the Spanish Inquisitioners who killed innocent children in the name of Christ are saints....

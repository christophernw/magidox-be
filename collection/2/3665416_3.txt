I'm told that having a baby always feels much better going in then coming out.  ;-). . In the bible, pain in childbirth was given to the woman as a curse for her partaking in the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil first.  . . Besides that, sex is meant as a pleasurable experience between a man and wife to help form an intimate relationship that they can build on, grow with, and use as a foundation to raise a family.  Sex is not a sin, if done within the bonds of marriage.  But you'll notice, most things done in excess, or done in ways they are not intended, are considered a "sin".

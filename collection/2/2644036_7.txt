I would suggest going to obedience classes with your dogs. It is fun, interactive, and will teach you and your dog.  You can then be the dominant leader with your dogs, and teach them what you will tolerate and what you won't.  Make sure, even though they are small, that they have exercise by walking them, they need that for stimulation mentally and physically.

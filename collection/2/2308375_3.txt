It's a tie between vision and hearing.  You could do without vision, because someone could always tell you about what you weren't seeing.  And you could do without hearing, because we have sign language.  But, without vision, you miss out on color and depth and just the beautiful world around you.  Without hearing, though, you miss out on music and laughter and different tones of voices... so, I think both are important.

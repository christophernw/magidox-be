Lots of different reasons.  Some people go because they don't know what else to do and it buys them three more years of time and is a pretty respectable thing to do.  Other people think it would be fun because they grew up watching LA Law, or Ally McBeal, or Boston Legal and have no idea what lawyers actually do.  Some people really want to help people, some people really want to make money.

While, I myself have a craving for Taco Bell every so often (I'm here in the States) you really aren't missing that much. You have such great Pubs, fish and chip shops and such lousy american fast food in the U.K. (personal experience). Enjoy the local cuisine or buy a packet of taco seasoning and knock yourself out!

I've rather noticed that there's a sizable amount of rather silly questions popping up, which is rather sad. I attribute it to a combination of the open nature of these question and answer boards (as opposed to professional newsgroups for those who work in specific fields), as well as the general inability of some folks to stop communicating... i.e. when looking at the list of the top ten people with the highest points on Yahoo Answers, 4000+ points in the span of a week is rather telling of how long someone's been attached to their computer.. . In my mid-thirties myself, curiosity has me poking my nose about a little this evening, but beyond that, it's back to doing research.

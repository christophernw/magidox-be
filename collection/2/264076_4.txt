A legal assistant or paralegal is a person, qualified by education, training or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible (ABA House of Delegates,1997).. . A paralegal is it's own profession. It is NOT someone on their way to being a lawyer.

This is a tough question to answer without knowing the dog.  My dog has missed my husband if he's out of town for awhile.  It is possible for a dog to miss somebody, but dogs have their own personalities and emotions too.  My dog sometimes just wants to be left alone.  She gets in good moods and down moods just like people do.  What kind of dog is it?  Some dogs don't follow commands every time you tell them to do something.  They have minds of their own.  :-)

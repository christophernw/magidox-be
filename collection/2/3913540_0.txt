i would of never got a leather couch with a kitty in the house, it's kinda like asking for it! maybe try the spray away stuff but it might ruin the leather, get a kitty scratching post and put Kitty nip on it so kitty will have some thing else to scratch on, if worse comes to worse, get kitty declawed if you can't part with the new couch a suppose, but i really love Kitty's, and if kitty gos out side after its declawed then it won't be able to defend its self very well, so if you declaw kitty don't let kitty out side.

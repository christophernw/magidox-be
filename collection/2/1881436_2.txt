They do not stay up by gyroscopic principles.. . If the wheels were heavy enough to behave like gyroscopes you would not be able to turn corners.. . Think about it, if the angular momentum of the wheels was enough to stop them tilting under the weight of you and the bike, then they would also be enough to stop you turning the front wheel.. . Now ask the question properly :-)

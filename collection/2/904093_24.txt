Where are these non - white zones? That's right they don't exist. You can walk down any street you care to. My nan lives in Sparkhill (a predominately Muslim area) and my brother in law (who's white) can walk where ever he choose unimpeded. He lives in Handsworth (predominately black area) and no one starts on him. So long as you keep your head down you can go where ever you please.. . The race card can work both ways, one of my Dad's ex-employees tried to sue him for racial discrimination (the guy was white), in actual fact the guy was sacked cause he always showed up late and was useless at his job.. . . Witchywoo- Wow here's me thinking 'keep your head down' was a well known idiom (or are you being wilfully ignorant). I don't mean literally keep your head down I mean don't go looking for trouble (or expecting) , just go about your business as normal and people will leave you alone. May be I should of said keep your nose clean.

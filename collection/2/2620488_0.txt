Actually what "they" say is not to keeps eggs in the DOOR of the fridge. The reasoning behind this is that the door is actually the warmest part of the fridge since its the farthest from the cooling mechanism and also, every time the door opens the temperature fluctuates even further, so you cannot be assured that the eggs are being kept at a constant temperature to prevent salmonella or something. As far as why there are egg compartments in the doors, that's just something that Fridge maufacturers added for convenience to sell more fridges, personally I keep my eggs in the bottom of the fridge in their original packaging.

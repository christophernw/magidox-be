It could be not only did He take her as an example for others but also so that she should not continue on the downward path and suffer even more. That precept can be found in the following passage.. . Isaiah 57:1  The righteous man perishes, and no one lays it to heart; devout men are taken away, while no one understands. For the righteous man is taken away from calamity;  (2)  he enters into peace; they rest in their beds who walk in their uprightness.. . It may be that God knew she wouldn't stop with just the first shot but would have gone on to worse and worse things if He hadn't intervened when He did. But of course, God only knows the true answer to your question.. . I'm sorry to hear about your friend and your loss. I know how painful and bewildering it must be.

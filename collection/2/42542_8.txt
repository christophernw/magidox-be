In order to stay slim you need to make sure that your 'calories-in' is in line with your 'calories-out'. If you want to lose some weight first, you need to consume fewer calories than you use.. . To ensure that 'calories-out' is in-check (i.e. there's a deficit), then you need to maintain a regular (min. 3 times per week) exercise routine.. . I recommend a low-impact aerobic (cardio) exercise, and some resistance training.. . You can enlist the help of a personal trainer, or grab an exercise book to figure out what you would enjoy doing regularly.. . Note: Diet pills don't help us to lose weight because they don't help us to consume fewer calories in the long-term or burn more calories long-term.

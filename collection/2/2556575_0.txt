It sounds like a cute idea, but I wouldn't recommend it. Rabbits have very thin, delicate skin and if the dye seeps through it, it could cause the animal to die. Also, it could cause lasting effects on their liver and kidneys as well. Maybe, you could just put some pretty pastel ribbons on them instead, they would still look festive without taking any chances.

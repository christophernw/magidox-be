To those who say that speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Spirit, I don't understand how this is evidence.  I can speak in "tongues" and I do it all the time in fact, when I am in my car singing along with foreign songs that I don't understand the words to.  I just make up words that sound sort of like a language.  And I developed a very real-sounding language from doing this.  So how would an outsider know that I wasn't "speaking in tongues" when truly, all I am doing is just making up sounds?. . Now if you can suddenly speak a foreign language that you never knew before, and someone who speaks that language hears you coherently, then that is significant.  Does this ever happen?  If that has happened, I would love evidence.

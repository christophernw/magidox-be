a finch is a tiny bird; probably about the size of two regular size erasers put together. not very big, and there are all kinds of finches. i have a zebra finch; i believe they are called zebra finches because on their tail feather it is black and white feathers. they are fun birds to watch. i have had mine for 2 and half years. and they are found all over the place. their could be some out in your yard right now.

Put the bible, the presence of Jews in the area for millennia, the peaceful purchase of land by Zionist leaders, and the United Nations resolution aside.. . Jews base their claim on the right of conquest, the oldest and most universally recognized basis for a claim that exists.. . Muslims certainly thought that it would be sufficient when they ignored the United Nations resolution on partition and launched a war against the infant state of Israel.. . The Arabs proved incompetent. Despite outnumbering their opponents by a thousand to one and having modern weapons and professional armies to use against poorly armed civilian settlers they were whipped like dogs. Even Israel women and children with improvised weapons proved able to defeat Muslims.. . Now that a half century of one humiliating defeat after another, the Arabs come whining and crying like babies with pseudo-legal arguments and appeals to the international community. Its a pathetic response by a pathetic and cowardly people who civilized humanity ought to hold in utter contempt.

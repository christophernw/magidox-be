The discoloration of a bruise is due to damaged blood vessels and capillaries.  There is nothing you can really do to make them heal faster, other than being careful not to reinjure the same area.  It is rumored that Vitamin K cream will speed the healing of a bruise, but since it doesn't get under your skin where the actual damage is, any effect it might have would be minimal.

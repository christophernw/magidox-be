I don't think you can.  If you have any of the expansion packs installed all you need is the cd of the most current expansion (they are not backward compatable; if you have nightlife installed you cannot run the game with the university disk).  If you have a lost or damaged cd contact EA games customer service.  They will provide you with a replacement disk for around $10 (you'll have to have previously registered your copy for this to work).

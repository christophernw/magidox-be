I think they are allowed to drink in pubs...unless the bar man decides the person has had enough and it would be incompetent of him to serve any more alcohol.. . As for the smoking....Its considered to be anti-social to some people and being a carcinogenic and passive smoking proven, why should the health of a non smoker be put at risk because of someones selfishness to polute their body?. If it was only their body they were poluting then fine...but as it's not.....it's banned in enclosed spaces.

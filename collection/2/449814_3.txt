Some woman are friendly and gregarious in nature and like to enjoy each others company.  In particular, if woman are out with mixed company (business or social), they like to solicit each others opinions concerning the topic of conversation just discussed or the present company.  . . If you ask me, woman are smarter and friendlier than men in this respect.  Men are far too "gender conscious" or insecure to do this.

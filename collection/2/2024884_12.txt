put your balls in the garage so they can't play with them. have a talk with the neighbors and POLITELY tell them if they are playing with the hoop then you can't. the local church put up a sign that said to ask for permission first and it seemed to work. and if all else fails scream LEAVE MY BALLS ALONE!!!!!!! LOL

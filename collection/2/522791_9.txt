You know you've blown the interview when your nervousness shows with dark underarm rings and sweat beading on your brow. Or if you didn't bring your own pen.  Or if you claim you have or have already faxed/emailed a resume but didn't bring an original with you to the interview.  Mumbling is a sure sign of poor communication so if you've been asked to repeat your answers several times you're screwed.  Bad spelling is another killer - especially in administrative positions and listen for the death knell if you've spelled poorly or grammatically guffawed on your resume.  Show up like you just got out of bed, with dirty or wrinkled clothing or like you're going for a night out on the town - in full make-up and big hair right after the interview - and you can kiss that job goodbye.  Best of luck in your job search!

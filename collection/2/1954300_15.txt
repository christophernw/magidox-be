I dunno.  I think unilinguists like to believe bilingual people are snobbish or conceited about speaking a second language. They always say they wish they could learn to speak another language, that it is so important and so impressive.  . . I take this as a complete load of hooey!  I think those people think I am conceited about being able to learn a second language, and maybe they want to hear me brag or something.  I know I learned to speak French because I wanted to, and they could do the same.  When it comes down to it, English-only speakers do not want to learn a 2nd language, or they would have already.  They tell me thy admire me, but they probably don't like people who speak languages that they (themselves) don't understand.  I may have a chip on my shoulder about this.  I am  just not overly impressed with being multi-lingual.  If it is a gift to learn languages easily, then it is simply that-- a gift.

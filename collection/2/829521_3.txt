well...i'm a student and over the years,i've had some very good teachers and very bad ones too. The main ingredient missing with the poor teachers was energy. Just ooze energy in the class and you'll be surprised by the attention your students reward you with. moreover, try to prepare as much as possible for every lecture and try and get some interesting facts too. Also, rather than using slides, prefer the blackboard more.most importantly, give ample respect, care and attention to your students and i'm sure they would reciprocate.For a physics teacher,I suggest you bring models of the objects you are teaching about or demonstrate the phenomena.For example, if you are teaching optics, you could bring a telescope, microscope, prism etc to class and show your students how things really work.If you've got good lab facilities, make utmost use of the because first hand experience is always the best teacher. Happy teaching :)

sugar doesnt actually have a drastic effect on behavior. . you didnt provide a lot of details, but i would guess it is something like a reward, and when the chocolate is gone, the kid has no reason to act good anymore, right? well at least, in his eyes. they eat their chocolate, they are mad that it is gone, and for a short while they can misbehave because they know they arent getting any more for awhile anyway. . then when you offer more either as a dessert or for good behavior... you see them act all nice, then the cycle goes again. . its just a theory, without much to go on, but i doubt its the sugar.

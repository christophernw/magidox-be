As much as the author would like you to believe, the DaVinci Code has no solid basis historically, Biblically, or theologically. The DaVinci Code is essentially an attempt to “humanize” Jesus Christ by inventing a story of how His true identity was distorted and hidden for nearly two thousand years. In the DaVinci Code, Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and had children. Mary Magdalene and Jesus’ descendants were the “holy grail” that carries the blood of Christ. The DaVinci Code states that these facts about Jesus Christ were covered up by the early church in order to protect the idea of Jesus’ divinity. All the Christian books which told of Jesus’ relationship with Mary Magdalene were destroyed. Any evidence of such a relationship was covered up.. .  . .             Again, the DaVinci code is fiction. It has no basis in reality. It is a well-written, entertaining book – but that is it. Dan Brown, the author, is of the persuasion that these ideas about Jesus are true. Since there is no historical, Biblical, or theological basis for his beliefs, Dan Brown presented them in a fictional account. Jesus was not married to Mary Magdalene or anyone else. Jesus did not have any children. Yes, the early church attempted to destroy many “gospels” about Jesus, but they did so because they were almost universally recognized as heretical, not to cover anything up. Even these “gospels” only give hints of a relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene. The church did not cover up the truth about Jesus being married to Mary Magdalene. Rather, the church protected the truth about Jesus being God in the flesh (John 1:1,14).. .  . .             The DaVinci Code is in reality an attack on the Person of Jesus Christ. People do not want to believe that Jesus is God, that Jesus is the Savior – so they make up false beliefs about Him in order to create a false Jesus that they can believe in. That is what the DaVinci Code is all about – presenting a false view of who Jesus Christ truly was…and then explaining why this “truth” has been hidden for nearly 2000 years.

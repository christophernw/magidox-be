Get a time machine that takes you back 2000 years, go to Mesopotamia and look for a guy in a dress.. . don't be upset when you realize that everything you have been told about Jesus turns out to be totally made up and he's just this drunken guy who's really good at public speaking and spends an awful lot of time with other men in dresses.

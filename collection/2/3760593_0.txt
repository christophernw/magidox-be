A poke is the chute that they put pigs in when they give them shots and stuff. The chute is very tight and they dont like going in there. But pigs can be very dangerous, especially sows. They can bite and it is a fact that pigs kill more people that any other animal. So imagine trying to get a 300 plus pound pig in a tight chute where it does not want to go.

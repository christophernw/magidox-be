You've obviously never been told this before so let me explain it. It's all a worldwide game. They are all just characters in this game. The point of the game is to run over as many of them as possible and you get points for everyone you run over. So the next time you see Little Junior thinking he's being a bad ass by walking in the middle of the road don't slow down. You get points docked for that. What you need to do is floor the gas. As soon as Little Junior hears those tires screeching he might learn that the only way to avoid being in the game is to stay on the god damn sidewalk.

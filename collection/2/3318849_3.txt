Novangeli's answer is correct, your integral is the sul of the two terms Integral[-(2x+3) from -4 to -3/2 ] + Integral [2x+3 from -3/2 to 2 ].. . On the contrary, what Greg says is "absolutely" not true. The absolute value of a continuous function change only the "smoothness" of its grafic representation, not its continuity, and a continuous function in a closed interval is always integrable!!!

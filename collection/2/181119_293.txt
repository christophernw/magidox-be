There are alot of variables. For starters...how old are you? If you are a youngster and live at home you could try mowing, babysitting, running errands, things like that.. If you are older and on your own I would try a cruise ship! They need people to entertain, wait tables, clean rooms, you name it. What an adventure that would be and you would meet so many people!

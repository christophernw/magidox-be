Does your dog do some serious running or jumping?My dog had this same problem with her front leg.I have dobermans and they run off the deck all the time,fast.She limped for quite awhile and I finally decided to take her to the vet. They x-rayed her leg and said I should probably take her to a specialist.I asked the vet if she thought the dog may have a  sprang? She wasn't sure so I took the dog to the specialist. He wasn't even sure and I asked him the same thing about the sprang. He said it was possible so I asked for a pain pill that I had used for a dog with cancer. The medication is a combo of inflammatory and pain medication. I put the dog on the medication, but she still limped for 6-8 weeks.I know it usually takes a long time for a human to heal from a muscle or ligament injury so a dog must be the same.The name of the medication is Deramax if your vet carries it. I hope your dog is feeling much better real soon.

this is kind of dishonest, but its the way i used ot get extra cash from my parents, say you have to buy somethign for school book, art supplies something along those lines preferably something you have had to pay for before or if your parents ever borrow cash from you, like my mom never would have cash on her, you can get them to pay it back like three times over easily, these are all very dishonest i know, but they work

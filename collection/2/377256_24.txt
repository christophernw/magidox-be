The best thing for you to do is tell someone. If you are harming yourself it is a sign of an illness that can only get worse if gone untreated.  if you are uncomfortable talking to a family member, find someone you are comfortable with and trust. I would suggest counseling to find out the underlying cause of the self harm. such as traumatic experience, etc

ooh ohh i know the answer to this question. ARE YOU SERIOUS????. let me tell you the story of a galaxy far far away.....SERIOUSLY. pluto and uranus? collided millions of years ago.....right above Earth.... at that time pluto's atmosphere was concentrated with hydrogen gas (dats why its so cold *hint*) and uranus was at the time the transport module for oxygen for the Little Green Men from Mars. Gas and gas formed a new substance that flowed substantaneously: WATER. . oh and the surviving Lil' Green Men from ze collision evolved to form idiots.......lets just hope u haven't got the genes(or perhaps stole them?)

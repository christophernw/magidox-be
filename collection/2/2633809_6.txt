Basing my answer on how I perceive tolerance, not on what the word really means.. . Tolerance = I can do whatever I want, but you don't have the right to do whatever you want because I don't agree with it.  And if you tell me I'm wrong, you're hateful and bigoted.. . What I wish it would mean.. . Tolerance = We all have the right to follow our beliefs, and we learn to get along, agree to disagree, and still respect each other.  The ability for opposing views to have a civil discussion and not turn to anger and hostility.  We could all express our beliefs without being belittled or insulted.

Here's one way:. . "Ich muss kopflos sein".. . [ I must not have a head ]. . or " Ich gehe verrucht". . [ I'm going crazy ]. . John F. Kennedy once sounded nuts to a lot of people in Berlin, when he spoke:. " Ich bin ein Berliner". A LOT of the crowd laughed at him.. . Trouble was, a "Berliner" was also a locally famous brand of Wiener, so it sounded like he said he's a hot dog--as if someone said " I'm a Big Mac!". . BUT, I think "Sexy Trojan" should get the 10 points, for making me laugh for 5 minutes with her hilarious answer!. . :-))

they all have repeating patterns of letters,. assess..... ssess. banana..... anana. dresser... .    resser. gramar.....   ramar. potatoe..... otato. revive..... evive. uneven.... neven. voodoo.... oodoo. see how the words are like mirror images when the first letter is taken off? when u get a quesiton like that, dont just think what do their definitions have in common, but their spellings also.

Because all the media cares about is...the media!. . They no longer deal in responsibility.. . And it doesn't even matter whether what they "report" is true.. . I've taken to calling it "the opinion" instead of "the news.". . I'll stop harping on this whe they start listing news broadcasts under "entertainment."

Hey come on.  Christians changed the date away from the proper date - either January 6th or March to hijack the midwinter festival which was a mixture of pagan and ancient European rites and celebrations.  Santa is a modern concept.. . But to put The correct answer to your question - Christmas as celebrated on 25 December has absolutely nothing to do with Jesus or the Christian faith.. . In Europe many Christians celebrate on the 6th of January and shun the 25th of December.  If only all Christians would take a few minutes to look at the facts and leave the rest of the world to enjoy the festivities of midwinter, world peace might come a little closer.. . And what about Christians celebrating on a pagan day instead of the correct Christian one - I wonder what God thinks of that?

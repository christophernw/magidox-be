it will have it on the side...if its a 2channel its R- L+. 4 channel the same...u may be tripping it because you may have 2 4ohm subs and the amp is not 2ohm stable bridged...only when using both channels....try hooking one first sub up if its ok try the other..if it trips then u overloaded it.....if u run the setup in the previous answer your load will drop to 8 ohms and u will lose half your amp power....if at all possible try to run a 4ohm load bridged....if u have dual voice coils if not your stuck either running 8 ohm bridged or 4 ohm on 2 channels....my final suggestion junk the amp....

There is a strange irony here.  The word Catholic means non-denominational, more precisely it means "all-embracing," or "according to the whole."   Meaning a Catholic belief is a belief held by the whole Church across all time periods from the apostolic period to now instead of a part of the Church.  Likewise, it means that you do not seek division and embrace all, even those you disagree with.  Only in extreme cases would one break communion with a brother or sister Christian.. . Non-denominational Christianity is, I believe, a sneaky version of the sectarian movement seeking to grab disenchanted Protestants and appears rather narrow rather than rather open minded.

When turkey became a country from the remnants of the Ottoman Empire at the end of WW-I, more than just he Turks got rolled up into that country.  To the east, portions of Armenia were co-opted, and to the south portions of what should have been Kurdistan were co-opted.. . The Turks did a pretty good job of ethnic cleansing on the Armenians (sarcasm, the world turned a blind eye to this).  The Turks have tried to ethnic cleanse the Kurds for years.  I think their big fear is that Turkish Kurds, Iraqi Kurds, and Iranian Kurds will band together and create a separate country.. . So to finally answer your question; I think the Turks are afraid of loosing territory and power.

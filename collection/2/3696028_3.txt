You have to put historical time into perspective. The geologic time table shows that the world has been around for over 4 billion years. We as humans have been around for less than a mere fraction of that time. It's basically a numbers game, asteroids do hit the earth time and time again, it's only a matter a time before another hits us. Also several years ago we missed a collision with an asteroid, additionally in the 90's Jupitor blocked another asteroid from hitting earth due to it's huge gravitational pull. Live long enough and you'll probably witness a collision.. . also we get hit by meteors every day/year, but most of the just are too small and burn up in the atmosphere.

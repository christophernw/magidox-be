Failure of governance is intrinsic within Islam and always will be as long as they continue to mix their religion with their politics.  Once a leader comes into power they also rule over the Ulama, thus the Shari'ah and fiqh change giving the leader absolute power of church and mosque.  And, as the historically proven proverb goes, absolute power corrupts absolutely.  So as long as Islam blends with the State, Islamic countries will alway fail.

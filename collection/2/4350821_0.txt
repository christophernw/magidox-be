The USA had entered an era of isolationism during WWI.  They viewed what was going on as "Europe's problems, not ours."  We finally intervened when we saw Russia had pulled out due to the revolution (which of course overthrew the tsar and started communism) and that britain and france were pretty screwed.  once we entered we demolished germany and the ottoman empire because all the troops on either side had fought so long it was easy for our army to come in and finish it.

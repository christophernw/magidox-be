First off, they ask dumb questions with incorrect grammar such as, "why isn't there any military bases".  The last thing the military needs is a bunch of dumb hicks corrupting our service people.  Second, we hope some one invades it and takes it off of our hands since it is so damn poor it is a burden on the rest of the USA.

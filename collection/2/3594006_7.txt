There are different reasons people ask questions. It is not always as Black and White as you see it.  People ask questions for a lot of reasons.  They need information: "Can you tell me how to get to the Post Office?"   Or they're trying to learn something; maybe they're faced with a problem:  "Honey, could you give me a hand untangling these Christmas lights?"    . . Then there is the guy who asks question after question, but doesn't always seem interested in the response.  "Why do you do it that way?  Wouldn't it be better if you did it differently?  Like you know--my way!"   He really doesn't want your answer.  He just wants his own opinion verified. Sometimes, people are deep thinkers and like to look beyond the surface. Other people may be curious. Get outside of the box. Try not to judge people or assume what they are asking is black and white. You may widen your own horizons a little, if you humble yourself a little. Most great thinkers look beyond the obvious.

It's a need, an insatiable curiousity that drives someone to know.  An intellectually stimulating upbringing coupled with a genetic predisposition to great intelligence can cause the thirst for knowledge to compare with the need for food and drink.  It becomes instinctual, though unnecessary for continued personal existence, like the sex drive.  Fulfilling these needs is a pleasure, one that keeps our race alive and pushes us towards a dynamic future.

if you are on the do not call list, when you make an inquiry, apply for a loan, or request for information and put your phone number, like when you buy a car, for example, the fact that you put in an application means you are giving them permission to call you.. . the do not call list only applies to unsolicited calls.. . as for your problem with someone giving out your phone number, all you can do there is let the callers know that there's no one here by that name, and tell them to stop calling your number.

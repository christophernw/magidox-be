Evolution would disprove God if only becaus we wouldn't have an accurate word of origin from Him. The Bible would not be able to be trusted, since Jesus thought the Old Testament stories were true (including Noah's flood), and if Jesus was wrong, this means He was not God. If He was not God, we are in trouble indeed.

A hissie fit is a fit that happens because of your REACTION to something that was really a non-event.  A conniption fit is your reaction to something that actually did happen.  Examples: "She had a hissie fit because he didn't apologize with as much sincerity as she thought he should."  "She had a conniption fit because the waitress forgot to bring her food and then didn't even apologize"

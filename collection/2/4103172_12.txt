I dropped out because I got married in my junior year (not pregnant..just in love!). I actually did get pregnant in my senior year and dropped out with only 2 credits needed to graduate:(. But I went on, raised 2 kids, been married almost 30 yrs.. I went to night classes for those 2 credits and got my actual high school diploma at the ripe old age of 33!!

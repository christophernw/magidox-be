What you describe is called epistaxis.  There are many reasons why this can happen.  The capillaries in the nasal membranes are friable (fragile) and more so in some than in others and overenthusiastic noseblowing can break them causing minor bleeds.  Dry membranes due to dry air or some medications can cause the capillaries to become friable.  An OTC saline nasal spray can take care of that by moisturizing the passages.  Hypertension (high blood pressure) can also cause this to happen.  Allergies that cause rhinitis, an inflammation of the nasal passages, can irritate them enough to cause bleeds.  Last but not least, excessive nose-picking can irritate membranes causing bleeds.  You can try OTC antihistamines but bear in mind they can cause dry nose too, as well as decongestants.  If the amount of blood you see in your Kleenex is insignificant, you can try the saline spray.  It's marketed under different names -- Ocean spray, Deep Sea -- and antihistamines. Try not to blow too vigorously.  If the amount of blood is significant or if it continues and/or increases in spite of the saline spray and allergy med,  it would be a good idea to visit your doctor for further evaluation.. . In the meantime, do not tilt your head back when this happens.  Try, instead, keeping your head level and pinching the bridge of your nose for 5 minutes.  Let me know how this works out for you.

i think u have wrongly written fobia.it should have been phobia.the fobia i know is "Fobia is a Mexican rock band from Mexico City, whose career started in 1990 with an untitled album which included the smash-hit song Microbito." . but phobia is an uncontrollable, irrational, and persistent fear of a specific object, situation, or activity.

Henry wanted a divorce from his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, because she hadn't given him a male heir. (Their only surviving child was a daughter, Mary). Added to this was the fact that Henry had recently become infatuated with one of Catherine's maids in waiting, Anne Boleyn. Catherine refused to grant Henry a divorce. Her nephew happened to be the Holy Roman Emporer. He had recently taken the Pope, Clement VII captive, and so the pope could not grant Henry a divorce without incurring the wrath of the Emporer. Henry had himself declared Head of the English Church and so was able to grant himself a divorce.

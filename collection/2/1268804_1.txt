i know how you are feeling, ive been married for ten years, and a couple of months ago  he wanted to have sex, so as you do i went to arouse him first and felt tiny lumps on him,well i wouldnt touch him until he had been to the doc, he did that and was told he had genital warts, so we both went for a checkup humiliating, for me as im very clean, i was told either one of us could be a carrier and not know it we could have it ten years then something worries you and it comes on then ,at first i found it hard to belive and accused him of straying, but he swore he hadnt, so i have to belive him we found out all my tests came back negative and there fore he his the carrier,it can de dormant for years then suddenly appear,wich can be a shock to the other person,you either have to trust each other and work through it together

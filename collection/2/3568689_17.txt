In any society humans are trained and conditioned by what we see around us. The sheep will always go along with whatever the social norms are perceived to be by the majority. The Press, the government and of course RELIGION only serve to to make matters more extreme. Violence is all around you. We absorb it with breakfast, lunch and dinner. In the morning it's the news about the latest deadly crash on the freeway. At lunch the news about the war. Just to make that sandwich more appetizing there's a couple of pictures of a burned dead body on the midday news.  A quick dinner then it's on to the entertainment. What will it be tonight honey? the Death du Jour Tonight will be Tony Soprano shooting his cousin in the head or if you prefer something lighter a CSI salad with arsenic dressing on the side. Nighty night dear sleep well!! Lets do it all again tomorrow.. I think the truth is that most people deep down find this everyday relationship with death and violence repugnant. Unfortunatly they can't do anything about it and they become immune to it's effects. Instead, they focus on the moral issues that they can do something about. Nudity is an easy target. So are gay marriage, Harry Potter books in our schools, and single mothers. People as a group are not free thinking. They are sheep who follow the leader no matter how horrible and repulsive. Without this fundamental truth war in any form would be impossible. . Thanks for taking the time to ask!!. Nakedly yours. IR

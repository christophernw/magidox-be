Yes, herding is in their genes and what they were/are bred for. I have a 7 month old 1/2 Aussie, 1/2 GSD who loves to run after me and nip at my pants (I've had to buy a few replacement pairs of jeans lol). He is a brat!. . A lot of exercize seems to reduce this behaviour. I take my pup out for at least an hour a day. This seems to tucker him out so he doesn't chase much. :)

You know, since i be straight up gangsta (okay, i'm asian....) but i know the reason why my homies be ghetto. i wil first explain to you why...... . Socetial "feminization" affect. Do you ever notice them having those freaking large cubic zarconium diamonds in those ears? you know why they wear them? to get the ladies! it works, women like "women like men." Girls like their men skinny....... . The hip hop factor. . in black culture, their seems to be this emphasis on "the bling" and hoes. Basically its about wanting to be rich (like so called rappers), but only buying clothese and material items to reach such status (you will notice their is not path in which it says how you can achieve this...) bling comes from the 99 cents store, XXL shirts are pretty cheap so thats why their worn, some guys forget to take out their afro piks...... . the "in da club" affect. . Black cultures seems to discourage "intelligence" and "success" sometimes. since the invention of so called gansta rap and being in the club, its something about freaking and demeaning women. i blame 50 cent.....its all about having fun and getting drunk and getting high...basically fun stuff in life.... . ignorance / not knowing better. . They are ghetto because they thought school was a social breeding ground to have sex. also when your friends don't succeed, it pressures for you to not succeed.. . cosby/ ebonics affect. iono...something about the language...kinda interesting. . . and my last reason that they are ghetto is because they are simply trying to live life as the best they could, as cheaply as possible, and living life

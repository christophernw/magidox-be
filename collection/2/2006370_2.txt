...growing?? belly fat usually occurs from eating carbs like pasta and also from genetics..... . try doing sit ups... start with 10 in the morning 10 at night for 1 week...move it up to 20, then 30 and so on and ur abs should be good in no time.... the key that most ppl forget is CONSISTENCY.... srsly some ppl try to do like 100 sit ups per day and they only last a week, if u follow a good diet regime, and work out and BE CONSISTENT u should see improvements in a month

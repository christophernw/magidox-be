The 'baby boom' refers to the large number of children that were born, in the USA, after World War II - from 1945 to 1964. . Before the war,  the USA was in a depression and people did not want to support large families because it was a financial struggle.. During the war, people were separated and  focused on the fighting overseas, so there were not as many children born either.. . After the war, when the soldiers returned home and we were out of the economic depression, many people then did decided to have families and many children were born. Also, since so many people had died during the war, it was encouraged to increase our population more. The war veterans also had financial benefits such as the GI Bill, which encouraged good educations for good paying jobs which could then support larger families, too.

Firstly - Is your spelling really this bad? Try going back and editing your question, using the spellcheck feature provided by our helpful answers team.. . Secondly - The miracle of the virgin Mary being the mother of Jesus is just that - a miracle. If we understood miracles they wouldn't be miracles. The notion of faith is a miracle, too.. . Thirdly - Good questions, actually. I guess when we begin to go by faith, accept and experience God in an intimate way, these questions tend to pale in light of his presence and power in our lives. And, you can ask God himself these very questions - he's not fragile, by any means! And, he has a sense of humor, too. Ask him to give you a better understanding and to straighten out your confusion. . . And one last thought: If we understood everything about God, he wouldn't be God, would he? I mean, that's sort of the point, right? He is God. It is hard for us to understand him and his ways.

Watch the show "Mad Money" with Jim Kramer on CNBC at 6:00. Whenever he picks a stock, it immediately tends to jump about 10%. I usually try to buy the stock immediately in the after hours trading. If you time it wrong, though, you can get buy high, and get caught in the sell-off as other investors take their profits. These stocks ususally bounce back in a couple of days or weeks, however. I've made thousands doing this, and currently only have 1 dog (Alcan), which is coming on like gang-busters, and should turn a profit soon.

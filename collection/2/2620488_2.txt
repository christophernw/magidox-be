I don't know who the "they" are that you're refering to, but the Food and Drug Administration says that eggs should be refrigerated and that they keep for 6 weeks IF refrigerated.  What that person or people may be refering to is that it is not recomended to put the eggs in the compartment that you refered to as they will go bad more quickly. It is better for the eggs to leave them in the carton that they were purchased in - in the refrigerator.

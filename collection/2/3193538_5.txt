One party (Republicans) is for a free-market, capitalist economy, with very little commercial regulations from the government.  Where businesses can do what they want (rape the enviroment, pay people $2 an hour, etc.) as long as they make a profit, because business drives the economy.  And the Democrats try to keep regular people from being screwed by big business.

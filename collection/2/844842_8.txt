Yes, it was a British protectorate..but lets look at some facts about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Over half the population of Palestine are under 15, 96% have suffered mental trauma comparable with child abuse, 93%have witnessed a family memberor friend killed...The israelis have received 120 billion us dollars worth of military aid over the past 2 decades..and the 26 million that was meant to help palestinian children was rejected by the Senate....hmm, That sounds like America the Fair doesnt it? . The israelis also used terrorist tactics before they had a state,so lets not start badgering the terrorist thang aroudn here shall we?.  Human rights groups are 'obsessed' with America and its biggest military base, namely Israel, because its you who should be setting a worldwide example..Gitmo, Abu Gahrib, the slaughter of Iraqi civilians by the 'Brave Boys' of the Marine corp...all of it is a shame on your country, and if it takes human rights to tell you, then so be it.

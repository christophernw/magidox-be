St. Joe's usually falls on March 19th, but can fall on different days:. . From Wikipedia: "If the feast day falls on a Sunday, the following Monday (March 20) is observed instead, and if it falls during Holy Week or Easter week, it is moved to the Monday after Low Sunday, or eight days after Easter (prior to 1970 the Tuesday after Low Sunday was used as the alternate date).". .

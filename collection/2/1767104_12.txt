Excessive ultra-violet radiation from the sun that can cause skin cancer in living organisms like humans, other animals... Also crops are affected, and especially phytoplankton in the oceans, due to excessive radiation messing with the photosynthetic cycle, and often destroying the organisms, which means anything that depends on these sources for food, etc., will also be affected.. . EDIT: causes: mostly CFCs, not really gasses that are produced by IC engine exhaust like someone else said.

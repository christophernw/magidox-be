Maybe we are all 'brains in a bath'... but unlike the 'tub bound brain' we can communicate... and each of our bathes...(because we can communicate) operates from a different perspective. It's probably obvious that I've never taken a philosophy course in my life... but honestly: does it matter? It's the welcome perspective of all these 'separately bound brain bathes' that makes life interesting to me.

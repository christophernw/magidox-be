This is assumed becuse on the day of pentacost(the day that the Holy Spirit fell upon the apostles)they were speaking in several different languages that the people understood.(there were a lot of foriegn Jews there at the time in jerusalem.......)this was for a sign to them that the gospel was from God.. In later times this has been used as a guage that one has truely been filled with the Spirit.Though this is not the case because the apostles and followers were speaking recognizable languages.. Modern speaking in tounges is more of gibberish uttering in my opinion.. This was not what happened in jerusalem back then.. I am not sure who started this gibberish speach trip, but it is very unbiblical.and probably not really real as those who do it would have us believe.

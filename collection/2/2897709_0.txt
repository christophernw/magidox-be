Science is a good discipline in teaching people how to think.  It matters very little what you study.  All subjects within science are based on the scientific method that is structured and logical.  Having that foundation will allow you to methodically solve any problems you may encounter in life, whether the problem originated in finance, business, science, philosophy, etc.

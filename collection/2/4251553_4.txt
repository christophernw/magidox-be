As a psychotherapist, and someone who has conducted therapy sessions with alcoholics, the key in the admittance is that you take RESPONSIBILITY and OWNERSHIP of the problem that you created. Someone who lives in denial over their issues is not going to change. When we admit our faults (especially in front of large groups of people) we put ourselves in an awkward position....we admit that we are wrong and that we need help to correct it.

Take Migraine Excedrine, if you can take acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine, it always helps me, but only if I take just as the onset of the mirgraine.. . Otherwise I would suggest the following, lay in a dark room motionless, and try to go to sleep.. . If the pain is really bad sometimes crying will help release pressure.. . And when all else fails, I get in a pretty warm to hot bath with ice packed in towels around my head, and soak, the heat seems to draw a little of the pressure from my head, while the ice packs help numb the area.

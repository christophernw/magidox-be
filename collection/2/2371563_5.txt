As chad_mercure said, though I'd have to say walmart is pretty cheap on oil prices, get a 5 quart jug of say havoline for around 7 bucks I believe it still is, havolines a great oil. Skip fram oil filters, they are cheaply made and overpriced, go get a purolator, which can range from 2 to 5 bucks the last time I checked, or a napa gold/ wix which are a little better made and a little tad more. All in all you'll spend maybe 15 bucks, and you'll have the satisfaction you did it yourself, and did it right.... jiffy lube and other quiky lube places will be a little more, and hassle you over extras you don't need.... autozone or advance auto take the used oil.... I'd also get a oil drain pan, wally world sales a blitz one around 8 bucks. And on the plus side... jiffy lube can't screw your car over and not fix it.

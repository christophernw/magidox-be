It means that they respect you for being their friend!! It's just what we use for our friends, it doesn't mean they're in love or anything!! It's also a way of saying that you're really cool!! They're also regarding you as one of them, you know, the boys!! So it's nothing bad. . I refer to my friends as; 'eh dog' or 'eh man' . . you're welcome. :)

this is a sad situation here. People who were gay and wanted to change it had urges for the rest of their lives. It's really sad. You will most likely always struggle with this.. . However, there is hope. God. With him, you can overcome anything. it will be tough, but ray, pray often, and try hard as you can.. . And it doesn't hurt to hang around a few ditsy blonds, either. Not a prescription found in the Bible, but i think it helps.

My wife does this all the time.  She'll cook some chicken and then leave it on the counter overnight, and eat it the next day without re-heating it or anything.  I understand that you should not eat it if it's been setting out for more than a couple of hours because of the possibility of salmonella poisoning... Well, she does this all the time and she's still alive and it's beginning to piss me off.

When it rings, I graciously say to the person near me  "you got that?" because I am sitting on the couch and cannot be bothered rising from my comfy position.  Then realizing I cannot stand to miss the ending of "The Matrix", which I have only seen seven times before, I say "Tell them I will call back in 10 minutes", which of course I do not.  . This is how I answer the phone!

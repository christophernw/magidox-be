You only pay the interest for a short term and then, after that term is finished, you refinance the mortgage debt at a different interest rate.  If rates are higher, oops; if lower, good with a qualifier--you will not have paid any of the principal so you will still have the entire debt plus interest to pay and you also will be charged refinancing and additional closing costs which can be expensive.  Best advice:  Stay away from an ARM.  If you absolutely have to have it now (and you don't), sell another asset or borrow from mom or dad in order to pay a higher downpayment and qualify for a 15-year mortgage.

All wrong so far!!.  'Valio' is in fact a very old Anglo Saxon word meaning 'Brave' or 'Valiant' the vikings used to shout it about a  lot while doing a bit of raping and pillaging in  England.. And  might I add that if any one deserved a bit of raping and pillaging it was (and still is) the English!. Hope this helps??

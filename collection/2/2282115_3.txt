Simply put, when a LARGE star, one much bigger then ours, runs out of fuel to sustain its nuclear fusion, there is know more outward pushing energy. Since the star is so massive, its gravitation is extremely strong. The gravity will make the star implode and become so dense that light cant even escape its gravity, hence the name black hole.

Because of MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving). They started out as an awareness group and became more of a political action group that managed to convince enough people in the House and Senate that drinking in high school at 16 and 18 leads to deaths of children SOOOOOO the House and Senate passed a bill that became a law saying that states couldn't get federal funding for roads and whatnot unless their drinking/purchase of alcohol age was 21 instead of 18. They can't come out and say "The purchase of alcohol and legal consumption age is 21" because that infringes on Constitutionally granted rights (see the 10th amendment) to the states. The states, however, are poor so they WANT the funding for highways. And that is why the legal consumption/purchase of alcohol age is 21 instead of 16 or 18 as it was.

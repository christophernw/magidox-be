As a deterrent. look, drugs policy through out history has been influenced largely by America, think about the prohibition era of that country (not that I'm assigning blame, America has taken awile to shake off its feeling of bieng the new (idealized) world) , it kind of comes from thinking that only a bad person has anything to do with vices like drugs. . And that its plenty cheaper to jail the guy than rehabilitate him, rehabilitation centers (as far as I know) are largly privately owned.

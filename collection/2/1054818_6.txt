Parents are usually running late for everything, so they omit the booster seat/ seat belts thing, so they can get somewhere in a hurry!  Its too much trouble to put on a seat belt, so they think!  And, will they hurry up their kids funeral, so they can go to the YMCA to swim, or exercise??.   I had a bull-headed friend, who said he wouldn't be caught dead in a car seat belt.  He wasn't!  Another car hit the left front corner of his car, an old Volare, rather rusty, on the left front corner.  His door popped open, he fell out between the cars, and was promptly crushed when the cars swung together!.   Well, he wasn't caught dead in his seat belt, was he? But, if he'd had it on, he might have survived the accident!

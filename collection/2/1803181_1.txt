you could take a train to france or belgium( there are lots of trains through the english channel to and from france) and then another one to...i don't think there are trains travelling straight to bulgaria; i think you have to change trains in vienna or budapest or bucharest. the journey takes lots of time and that's not comfortable as you have to change trains too. my advice is to take a plane. good luck !

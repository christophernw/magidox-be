I think they sleep just like men too, same species .... . I sleep in anyway depending on how i feel, if i'm really tired, i sleep on my back crossing my legs, one over the other( weird i know ) , but sometimes i don't. Maybe in the middle of the night, i may switch to lying on my tummy facing the wall while resting my head on my hand, so my head doesn't sink into the pillow and suffocate me ( !! ) And otherwise i sleep on my sides , but seldom, because it sometimes makes my shoulders and arms hurt at night . i don't like sleeping on the edges or sides of my bed because i used to fall, and besides the middle is more comfy .

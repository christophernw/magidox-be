I know your pain, I just lost two, my first, I had my conure for three years and the other was a rescue that was 9.  I can't hardly stop crying. they are a part of our family, I am so sorry for you.  About getting a new one, grieve first.  Then take your time to chose as I am,  I believe that we will know when we see the next to be.  Don't know about you but we (our family)  can't live with out feathers in the house!  Please cheer up !!!!!!!

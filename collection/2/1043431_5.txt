Your flesh will be returned to the soil from which it came, and the inner part of you that makes you who you are will meet with your creator and will be judged according to your actions  while you were physically alive. If you knew Him and chose His redemption as a covering for your falling short then you will enter into His kingdom, if you never knew Him then you will be cast into eternal suffering. Plain and simple.

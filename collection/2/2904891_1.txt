are you someone famous? does every liberal believe this? or just a couple of people.  If you are famous, then there would be a lot of people who know you and then we could say what you are saying but if you are just an everyday dude then i would think you would have the opinion of very few people and you can't judge all by a few.... get it....got it....good.....             . . . ok, i had to add this. you sound like you are driving yourself nuts here. Do you really think someone will burn down your house or kill you because you asked this question? everyone is intitled to their opinion. take it and go on with life. so what, someone called you gay. big deal. sounds to me like that YOU are the one who doesn't like gays. Otherwise you would not have taken this as an insult. Get a life dude.

you lose weight when you smoke meth.. also you have hullucinations.. if you smoke it you tend to loseyourself. you brain starts rotting until it cannot control you that well...which is when you start going crazy and acting weird.. aKa talking to people who aren't there, sometimes you like black out...don't know what is happening and the next morning you find yourself somewhere else.. Also people who smoke meth tend to think they have like worms crawling and eating them so they tend to peel of their skin.. . Check the persons skin, under the eyes, stomach etc for what looks like scabs or something...also check for all the other symptoms listed above.. . Hope I helped...I tried being as correct as possibe =P

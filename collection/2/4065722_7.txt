First of all, we do not get oil from Iran.  The issues in Iran have to do with their threatening the development and use of nuclear weapons.. . Now, the prices are high due to supply vs. demand.  You ask why the supply is lower than the demand all of a sudden?. . Well, maybe because we have not built a new refinery in 30 years thanks to liberal legislation.  We also just lost one of the few refineries we had in New Orleans.  Therefore the ability to refine the same amount of Oil we have been refining for 30 years has greatly deminished.  Do you think the demand has gone down in the past 30 years?. . Also, we have as much oil in Alaska as they do in the middle east, but again, due to liberal legislation, we can not drill for it.. . p.s.,,  I think the answer you want is, "they will keep going up as long as Bush is in office."  But sorry, that answer is just flat wrong.

Humans, the human body, or any human body parts are not permitted on eBay (I believe blood falls into this category). Items that contain human hair (such as lockets) as well as skulls and skeletons that are used for medical purposes may be listed on eBay. eBay does not permit the sale of Native American skulls, bones or other Native American grave-related items, as the sale of such items may violate federal law.. . Violations of this policy may result in a range of actions, including:. Listing cancellation. Limits on account privileges. Account suspension. Forfeit of eBay fees on cancelled listings . Loss of PowerSeller status . . Selling blood on eBay is not a good idea!

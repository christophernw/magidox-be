You most certainly won't find the help you need on this site.  Since you asked, God did not force your friend to shoot up on heroin.  When you do this whether it is the first time or the 59th time only two things can happen and both of them are bad.  First you can get hooked and second you can die.  There is no good except for a temporary feeling you may achieve.  It is stupid.  . . I am sorry about your friend.  But just know that God did not do this to make an example of her.  Satan is the one who tempted your friend.  God does not tempt anyone.  Some time He will test us but He never puts more on us than we can handle.  Your friend made a choice to try heroin and the outcome was bad for her, her family, and all of her friends.  God bless you and I hope you learn to overcome the hurt and the loss.  I believe from your question that your friend was probably a Christian and if that is true she is with Jesus now and the two of you will have a wonderful reunion one day.  She will be waiting on you.

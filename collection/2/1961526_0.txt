My heritage is Bolivian, growing up, people always thought it was in Africa somewhere. .   Before I went to Bolivia to study, I had a friend ask me if it was a safe place for Americans to go "being so close to the Middle East and all..."  I just laughed. I asked him if he had ever heard of Simon Bol√≠var, and that Bolivia is in South America.

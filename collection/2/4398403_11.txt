The stars "twinkle" due to the fact that they generate their own light, and that light gets refracted by earth's atmosphere.  Planets, on the other hand, don't generate light, and merely reflect light from the sun, and in general they are closer to us than those stars.  Thus there's going to be less refraction from earth's atmosphere.  This might not apply to a planet outside of our solar system though.

They'e crazy because they actually believed that Bush, and Company might have done some good for America and the world when he was elected. Turns out, Bush intentionally destroyed the middle class, and that a--hole created the greatest deficit in the entire history of civilization as we know it.   He also gave aid and comfort to the enemy by intentionally creating motivation for Islamic Jihadi's to commit terrorist acts.  They would never have done that to the extent they do now, had a Democrat been in office.   Bush hates America, and he avoided impeachment for treason when Democrats won control of the House, and Senate.

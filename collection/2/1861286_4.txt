I am always surprised that crosses are the primary symbol of the religion.  I think Christianity is the only religion where the instrument of torture for their savior is the most recognized symbol of the faith.  Baffling.  I have seen pretty ones and I have seen gruesome ones.  I guess it invokes a particular moment in history, but I would think that there are more uplifting symbols of the religion (or there could have been, at least).. . Peace!

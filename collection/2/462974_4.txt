The fact is we are not these bodies.  We are not our race, color, nationality, religion,mind,etc. This is all the bodily concept of life. We are spirit soul part and parcel of the Supreme Soul.  If one wants to be happy then they have to realize who we actually are.  It is only illusion or Maya to think we are these bodies.  IF one wants to be free from this illusion and misery the quickest and easiest way is to chant the Maha Mantra (The Great Mantra for deliverance)  Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare  for all details go to http://www.stephen-knapp.com/chanting_hare_krishna.htm

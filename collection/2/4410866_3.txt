Because the majority of people in this country are White and I hate to stereotype but most of them have a hard time finding other groups of people desirable or as good as them. They only like Black women that look biracial or that are so light that you almost think their White. I personally don't think Halle Berry looks "white",there are a lot of pure 100% Africans that have narrower features then hers such as Iman, Liya Kebede, Yasmin Warsime etc... Not all Black people look the same does Liya Kebede look like Oluchi onweagba or Alek Wek..NO so I think that society need to accept the rich diversity and beauty of Black people. Society also needs to accept the beauty of ALL people around the world and stop using White women as the standard because that isn't fair.

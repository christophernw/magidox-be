They are right, Frontline (or advantage) is the best way to get rid of fleas.  Frontline in particular kills flea eggs as well as the fleas themselves, and will cost you as little as $20.00 on ebay for each of your pets.  The most effective way I've found for getting rid of fleas is to buy and use a three-month supply of Frontline per animal.  In the first month, the fleas and the flea eggs on the animal are killed, and in the following two months, the flea eggs that hatch and find their way onto your animal (and any eggs they lay) are killed.  Flea eggs may hatch for up to three months.  Therefore, a three-month supply of Frontline will take care of any flea problems you might have more than any other product.  . . Also, seeing as few other products actually kill the flea eggs, you're probably much better off financially buying three months of Frontline than you are buying other flea products that don't kill the eggs.  Believe me, I have been there. . . Here's a ebay store where you can buy Frontline at a fraction of the Vet Clinic's price:  http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQfgtpZ1QQfrppZ25QQsassZnoahpets  .. it's where I bought the Frontline for my cat.

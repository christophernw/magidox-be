What do you mean Christians pick and choose what pleases them?  Apparently, your observations are not fact but opinion.  It's hard not to pick what you know in your heart to be true.  The Word of God is true.. . Christians believe in and follow a living God, not a dead one or a non-existant one.  That's the difference between the Christian "religion" and all other religions.

Hey was I told that I am better than everyone else when I asked a legimate question. I am a mere peasant in the general scheme of things. Liberals get offended when you ask a collective question. They are about that. Notice the double standards that they use when addressing plain folks. They care not about sensitivity but claim they care about the poor.This can't reconcile. Claim to be Christian yet don't practice it. Claim there a Plan for congress yet don't produce it. Say they are not moving Left yet hace a Huge leftist conclave in DC!

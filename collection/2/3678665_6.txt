Can you tell me which democrats are saying this???. . And if they are saying it, it is because there is a difference between a woman making a medical choice for herself and someone else coming along and taking choice away. (Those woman may have wanted to have their fetuses grow into babies.) Also when an abortion occurs it is a FETUS that is aborted NOT A BABY!!!. . You emailed me and then blocked getting contacted. So this is my response to you:. I was raised Catholic and Catholicism is what is closest to what my beliefs are. I have tried other religions and I still feel closest to Catholic.There are also things in my culture that contradict what my religion dictates. I follow the basic beliefs but not all of the practices - if that makes sense. I have had this discussion with my priest and I told him, just as I am telling you, that women's reproductive health has no business in the church. When my time on Earth is up and I meet the Lord for His judgment, He and He alone will be the one to tell me I was wrong. Until then, my beliefs are as they are and I still attend church every Sunday.

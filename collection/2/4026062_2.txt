look for BACKSTAGE... it is a periodical. it is also on the web... just do a yahoo/goggle search to find it... you will also find  other performing arts information in it. the VILLAGE VOICE also has audition postings from time to time... the voice may be found on-line as well... it also depends on what kind of dancing you are looking to do Broadway or Jazz, Ballet,Modern or Contemporary,or Music Videos... find someone you are interested in dancing for and then locate their website cuz some companies will post audition notices... network, talk to other people who dance  because, word of mouth is one of the best ways to keep yourself informed...good luck

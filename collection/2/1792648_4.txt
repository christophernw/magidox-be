Brownian Motion is the small vibrations of particles inherent in everything.  It is often difficult to observe because they are small compared to overall motion.  If you want to observe brownian motion you can put a small amount of cork dust on a drop of water under a microscope, if you see minute vibrations you are seeing Brownian motion.

Focus and do well on whats important to you. A good education is extremely important -- what I would do is sit down and say, "exactly what do I want to accomplish?" Make a list, and be specific of what you want to change to be. Then from there you can work out the steps it takes to get to that place.. . But I'd say, more than anything, embrace who you are. You don't need to completely change. If there are things about you that you don't like because YOU dont like them, or know that they are wrong, then its alright to change for the better. But if you are wanting to change for the eyes of all the others around you, to impress and feel belonging, I would think very hard on it. Do you really want to?

Humans are the the only humans that kill not out of necessity but out of pleasure, for entertainment , and for our personal use ( fur coats ). Of course there are some other animals that tend to do this stuff ( cats that play with their food ) but we managed to ... evolve in a bad way and because of that so many species are extinct . I belive conscience is our way of telling ourselves what we're doing is harming the world around us .. I realise i only answered half of the question , but maybe because we harmed everything else for so long we developed this aptitude to distinguish good from bad in a very basic way towards every bad deed . . It's 24:37 over here , so i'm sorry if i'm not making any sense , but i'm really tired.

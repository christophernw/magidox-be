The fire that you see is simply the result of the enourmous heat generated by the chemical reaction of oxygen with the fuel (the substance on fire), known as a combustion reaction. Normally this process occurs slowly, but if the reaction proceeds quickly, as in the case of something on fire, then the reaction generates an enourmous amount of heat is released as fire.

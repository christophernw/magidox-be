Among say a 100 people watching a fashion show, maybe 10-20 appreciate the designer's idea and effort in the design of the clothes. But what about the rest of them? I dont think the majority are even interested in getting to know that. Then, what all males naturally appreciate is, ofcourse, the women modelling those clothes, rather than the clothes themselves.

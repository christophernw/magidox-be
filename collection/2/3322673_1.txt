The definition is simply energy in = energy out. Solar incidence is reflected, scattered, and absorbed at the surface. The net influx of solar radiation at the surface minus the heat loss at night through long-wavelength emission would give you the net radiation balance. Remember, that natural isotope decay takes place within the earth, as well as heat from the core, which both over time emit from the surface in long wavelengths of energy. Look up Wien's displacement theory in physics books for more info.

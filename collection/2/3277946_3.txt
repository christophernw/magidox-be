Your body needs a certain amount of fat for help with cushioning, hormone levels, energy stores, etc.. . The fats in nuts and seeds are actually good for you, called Omega3 or Omega6.  These fats act very differently in the body compared to the trans or hydrogenatred fats that are found in a McDonalds meal.. . Even a little butter in moderation, is much better for you than french fries, McDonalds, or commercial brand potato chips or cookies, for example.. . Hope this helps.

Take a fork and pick one out. Eat it, if it's done, it's done, if it's not it's not. How hard is that? The wall trick kinda works but if you wait that long your spaghetti will be over cooked. You need to take it out of the water before it's looks done. The noodles will continue to cook themselves for about five minutes after they're taken out of the water. The rule is 6 minutes of cooking per serving. And remember to add salt and oil to the water before you heat it. The salt allows the water to boil at a higher temperature making for faster cooking, and the oil keeps the noodles from sticking together. Good luck.

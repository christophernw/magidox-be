First, I've looked at all the questions you've posed on Yahoo answers.  You seem to be very angry with God.  Why?  Maybe the questions you SHOULD BE asking are ones to help you with your anger, not ones to fuel it .... . Second, who said Jesus permitted the "slaughter of millions of indigenous souls around the world"?  I don't see that anywhere in the Bible.  What God's Word does make clear is this:  1)  Those who are truly saved love other humans as they love themselves, and would never commit murder to advance God's purposes (i.e. abortion clinic bombers; jihadists; ect); 2)  Perhaps your question really concerns the fate of those who died without hearing the gospel.  There IS a way for people who lived prior to Jesus' birth to be saved.  If you want more details on that subject, you must ask that question; 3)  Only those who KNOWINGLY hear the Gospel (Good News) of Jesus and KNOWINGLY reject it are condemned to Hell.  Calling this a "slaughter" is the same as decrying the punishment of a criminal.  Those who die without God's saving grace (before and after Jesus' birth) are criminals, having no way to be excused of their crimes.  You may think this sounds unfair, but Jesus (who will judge all humankind) is perfectly righteous; and because He is so perfect and so righteous, He will ensure that NO ONE who died in his or her sins will go unpunished.  That means every unsaved adulterer, thief, murderer, homosexual, witch (and the list goes on and on) will be condemed to Hell upon death; after Jesus's millenial reign, they'll be tossed into the Lake of Fire and that will be the end of them. . . I pray you come to real understanding by casting aside your anger.  This is a serious matter with eternal consequences.

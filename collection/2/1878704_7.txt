It a Book that's based on a theory that Jesus was married and had a daughter Sarah who then was transported to France and there continued the bloodline of Christ and had several protectors Leonardo DaVinci being one who supposedly hide secret meanings leading to the trail of this bloodline in his paintings and drawings. . . Many have written trying to say it is tru, many have also published trying to bunk the claims made in the book, and No one really knows which side is right and everyday hundreds of people on this website bicker back and forth about which side is right.. . Do some research in Holy Blood, Holy Grail and also read the DaVinci Hoax this will give you both sides of the argument.

Dobermans are typically "docked" in keeping with the American Kennel Club breed standard, which calls for docked tail and cropped ears. My Dobie has a tail dock, however, I left his ears natural. Either way, these dogs are amongst the most beautiful of breeds, with noble stance and a powerful presence. As stated before, the practice of tail docking and ear cropping originated due to the breed's "protective" origins.

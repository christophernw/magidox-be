it is the worlds most boring thing you have to fill in if you wish to apply to uni, you include in it past grades, courses you wish to apply for and a personal statement  in which you talk nicely about your self so the uni addmissions guys want to offer you a place, on ucas you can also confirm places and offeres and also access the clearing system after results day, if you have been unable to acheive your desired place, and wish to look for an alternative course that you have the grades (or ucas points, there just another silly system of grading) for your origional places!. hope that helps and good luck if your applying!

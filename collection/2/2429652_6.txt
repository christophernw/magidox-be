When I was younger I too would tell myself the same things. I had very low self-esteem and would constantly beat myself up.  When I got older I talked to a counselor, got tested and found out I had a chemical imbalance (serotonin) that caused me to be depressed(hence the negative thoughts) compounded with a lonely childhood.  I was treated for the imbalance and counseled for the negative thoughts. I was told for every negative think of and say out "I got out of bed and brushed my teeth)  It takes practice to think of positive things when weve trainded ouselves to think negative.  Remember that we are our worst enemies.  Make yourself your friend,your Best friend.  You deserve to be happy.  You are a good person.  See a counselor, get tested for depression, get treated, and think positively.  Good  luck to you.

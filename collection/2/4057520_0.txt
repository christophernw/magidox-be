This is my perspective on the topic:. A Prophet is one who speaks for God and warns or informs on events which may occur later, instructed by God directly.. A Psychic has the ability to read into a persons future or predict a future event through their own "spiritual" abilities or awareness of their higher selves.. A Medium is someone who communicates with or conveys a message for people who have passed on. A medium is often able to allow the "spirit" to communicate directly through him/her. Hope this helps.

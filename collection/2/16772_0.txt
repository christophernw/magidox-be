It's probably either wax build up or water in your ear.. . Try the way doctors do, do a half and half mix of water and peroxide, put a couple drops in your ear, then when the bubbling stops, rinse with a syringe of some sort with warm water.. . I have also heard if it is water and you do not have an ear infection you can put a drop of alcohol in your ear to dry it up.

It's possible they were. Not all animal names in the Old Testament are always properly translated. There is some question as to the identification of some of them. Plus, if you read Job, you will notice references to two animals, the "leviathan" and the "behemoth". Ever wonder exactly what those were? The discription of them given in Job doesn't sound like any "modern" animal I've ever heared of.. . Also check out www.answersingenesis.org ; they should have some more information on this topic.

If theres enough hair to be annoying, then you arent grooming properly; your pooch needs brushing every day, not just once a week, and in warm weather he will need brushing more, as the heat will cause skin irritation.  Brush the animal well, and use a rubber dog brush, not a metal one that can scratch the skin and cause infection.

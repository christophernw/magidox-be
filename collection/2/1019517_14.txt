Feed her Purina Kitten Chow...it is in a yellow bag and you can buy it from Walmart.  I have raised several kittens and they love it!! Don't feed her milk or other table food. Milk or table food is hard on kittens stomachs and can cause diarrhea! If she doesn't eat the dry kitten chow, put some warm water over top of the kitten chow to moisten it. Kittens love to drink the flavored water off and then eat the soft food.  Make sure you don't get Walmart or off brand kitten chow because they don't have the right amount of nutrients as name brand foods.  . . Also get her to the vet and have her checked for Feline Leukemia and FIV (feline aids) ASAP. Also get her kitten booster shots!

well i do not quite know how you get it.. i wish i never experienced it.. but i think mine stems back to being such a caring person, and so many things happening in life that i get so upset about.. you know it is easy for people to tell you things but putting them into action to help the depression is another thing.. i am to easily hurt and let things people say bother me too. there is so many judgemental people in the world.. i have a neighbor that thinks she knows all and she is always putting people down cause they do not do like she does.. i have finally decided not to be around her anymore.. we all are different and we can decorate  our homes the way we want to.. i am thankful i am not like her. i would not use a man for his money and the things he buys her and she does not really care for him at all. that is wrong in my book..she does not like to hear children cry in walmart or a restaraunt.. well kids are going to be kids..well i just do not thing it helps a depressed person to be around someone like heer..there is medicine you can take for depression, but i do not think the one i am on is the right one.. being depressed is feeling sad,not feeling like gettting out of bed alot of times..sometimes it just feels like you can not face another day.. a lot of mine has to do with my sons.. most of it is something you can not help anyway.. i am trying to stay to myself and just be arond people that do not want to judge and put you down..but i see a counselor now and doctors and i believe i am doing better.. i have had head trauma and it is hard for me to remember a lot of things,, but sometimes things triggers the memory of something in my past..i hope if you have depression it is a mild form and hope you have a happy life..

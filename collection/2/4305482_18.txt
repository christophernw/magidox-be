Hey Kiddo, you are absolutely CORRECT!. . Good Lord people!. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on Jan 1st 1863, did NOT FREE A SINGLE SLAVE!. It applied ONLY to slaves in "rebellion" i.e. the Confederacy!. The Confederate States in the MIDDLE of the Civil War, choice to "ignore" it.. . AND. . The Emancipation Proclamation specifically did NOT apply to the 800,000 slaves in slave holding states i.e. Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky & Missouri.....UNION STATES PEOPLE!. . Slaves in the Confederacy were freed when the SOUTH LOST THE WAR in APRIL 1865.. Slaves in the UNION SLAVE HOLDING STATES were NOT freed UNTIL the 13th Amendment adopted DEC 18th 1865! AFTER LINCOLN WAS DEAD!. . Abraham Lincoln was STRONGLY in FAVOR of having MILLIONS of freed slaves LEAVE THE US AFTER THE WAR!. . He went as far to investigate founding a new colony as a  haven for freed slaves.  Lincoln said, and I quote, "YOUR RACE SUFFERS GREATLY, MANY OF THEM LIVING AMONG US, WHILE OURS SUFFERS FROM YOUR PRESENSE.  IF THIS IS ADMITTED, IT AFFORDS A RESON WHY WE SHOULD BE SEPARATED" in a speech to prominent blacks in AUG 1862.. . The Lincoln administration went as far to sending out inquiries and actually LOCATED two places to SEND THE SLAVES.  Panama and the Caribbean island of Ile a Vache.. . In APR 1862 Congress passed a bill freeing slaves in Washington DC and actually set aside $100,000 to pay for PASSAGE for slaves wanting to emigrate to Haiti and Liberia.. . This course of action was cut short when on APR 15th when Lincoln was shot.. . Lincoln freed no one.  And that is the hoest to God truth.. Please, continue to look things up on the internet and learn the truth and no not take anything for fact just because it is a popular answer.. . AND ALWAYS QUESTION AUTHORITY!

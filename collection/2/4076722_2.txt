you want healthier teeth and i'm assuming gums.  You need to brush you teeth at least two times a day, after breakfast and before you go to bed.  You should also substitute a toothpaste with a mixture of peroxide and baking soda.  Maybe rinse with Listerine or some sort of germ killer before you go to bed too.  Your teeth and gums should be healthier if you stick with it.  Eat some food with calcium.  If you don't like milk, there are some other foods like broccoli. (I hope I spelled that right)

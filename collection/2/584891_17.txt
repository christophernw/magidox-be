It's got to be something better than the obvious - that he's been a secret Deatheater all along and was looking for an opportunity to finally get Dumbledore.. . He has been way too interesting a character throughout the series for him to be revealed as a baddie just like that.  (Though, of course, I always thought Syd's mom on Alias was a character like that too - and she wound up being the big baddie in the end.). . I will totally hate Book 7 if Snape's real reason for killing Dumbledore doesn't have something to do with protecting Malfoy and his own cover with Voldemort.

Why do you want to convert so much energy into mass when we on Earth are facing energy crisis? even if you managed to do that, the mass would be so huge that you yourself would not be able to hold it.. . Relativistic Physics (as someone else has written) consider both mass (m) and energy (E) as equivalent (i.e., one can be converted into other) at the speed of light c=3x10^10 cm/sec. However, the present day Physics allows us to convert mass to energy and we will have to wait for further advancement to see your wish fulfilled.

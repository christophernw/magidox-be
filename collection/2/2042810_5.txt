The lizards won't jump on you, as soon as they see you coming towards them they will run away. Lizards (actually called the Green Anole) are justa part of living in the Southeast (especially in Florida).  They are good for eating ants, mosquito larvae and other small insects.  If you take some time and watch them quietly you can see some really goofy behavior, such as "push ups" and the males showing off their throat flags.

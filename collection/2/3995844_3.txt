Your question is still under study by scientists even though the subject of Galaxy Formation has advanced considerably during the past decade. On the theoretical side two theories in particular have been developed to the point where confrontation with observation will be possible; these are the "Gravitational Instability Picture" and the "Cosmic Turbulence Theory." There is now a considerable body of data on galaxies; the problem is in deciding which kind of observation is most relevant to understanding the origin of galaxies.. . One of the possible explanations could be the development of convective instability in a rotating gaseous disk--a mechanism by which a spiral structure is formed in a gravitating rotating gaseous disk. Caused by a nonlinear development of the convective instability, this mechanism may be responsible for the origin of spiral galaxies like ours.

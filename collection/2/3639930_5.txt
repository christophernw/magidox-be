There are many different side effects of taking birth control. It depends on what type you have switched to, but sometimes things like that can happen. If you are truly concerned, speak with your gynecologist, he/she might be able to give you the answers you need. If it is irritable and is causing a problem, make an appointment. However, during intimate times lubricant can help.

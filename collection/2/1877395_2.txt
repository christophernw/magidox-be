Well closely related doesn't mean exactly the same, I thought they hypothesized that we have different genes at the level of 4%.  So right there, eye color difference may be accounted for. Also, how do you know that chimps don't have a recessive gene for light colored eyes which never gets expressed because two chimps with light colored eyes have never mated?

If you press it, it feels a bit soft. Hard ones are not ripe and of course you peel it. best way is to cut it in two halves vertically, twist the halves in opposite directions, one half will come clean and the other with the seed, twist the seed, eat the flesh on it, use a spoon to scoop mango flesh from the halves. bon appetit.

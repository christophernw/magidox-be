Well I can tell that most of these people don't ride, lol.  Actually it all depends on your insurance company.  If you have a separate policy for your bike, then it will only affect the rates for your motorcycle policy.  If you have tickets on both policies (car and bike) the company can choose to raise your rates on both policies.  . . Tip:  Don't get caught! LOL  Good luck.  Any other questions, just ask your agent.

Most hydrogen peroxide is in a dilute solution of water, typically 3% hydrogen peroxide. This dilute solution makes it relatively harmless.  In the US it is illegal to have hydrogen peroxide in a solution of more than 30% without a permit. . . Hydrogen peroxide is H2O2 and is not stable. It will in fact decompose explosively, and is used in high concentrations as a rocket fuel. The decompostion reaction is highly exothermic, meaning it gives off heat. . . The reaction is:. 2 H2O2(liq)  + catalyst (platinum, etc) -----> 2H2O(g)  + O2(g) +heat. . Hydrogen peroxide vapor can even spontaneously detonate at temperatures over 70 degrees C. . . None of these reactions would probably be considered "burning" because burning is generally defined as oxidation, and since hydrogen peroxide is already oxidized, this is instead a decomposition reaction that releases oxygen. With some catalysts such as iron, hydrogen peroxide will decompose forming compounds other than H2O and O2. . .

Before 9/11, before WMD's, before our inept President there were the "White Papers". Drawn up in the latter part of the 90's by five political "donuts", three most notibly, our esteemed President(gag),his invisible sidekick Dick "sharpshooter"  Cheney and the "master of disaster" the imperial game planner himself Big Donald Rumsfeld. Please, go to the web and look up the information for yourself and you make the judgement as to if this was not well planned even before these idiots came into power. Funny what can happen when you rig the electoral college and have a dirty brother as govenor of Florida and surprisingly win the seat of the "highest office" to make all your dreams come true.

First of all, you can get a bladder infection from intercourse. I have suffered with this problem all of my adult life. Second of all, read the comment from Nurse Annie, she knows what she is talking about. Third of all, drink plenty of fluid before having sex, so that afterward, you will go to the bathroom right away. This flushes all the bacteria that got pushed into the urethra out before it causes an infection. ALWAYS PEE AFTER SEX! It is the best thing you can do for your urinary tract health.

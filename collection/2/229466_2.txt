The Witching Hour by Anne Rice is just awesome.  Its scary and fascinating and when you read it you feel like you are in the book or watching a movie.  You can see everything in your head.. . It follows a family of women dating back to the 1500's and in each generation there is a powerful witch that does either good or bad and there is this bad spirit named Lasher that has attatched himself to each generation of witch.  It is so so so good i cant even begin to describe just how cool the book is.. . Also..."Haunted" by Chuck Palhnuik is really good, maybe not age appropriate.  It is a colection of short stories with a single story running between each short one.

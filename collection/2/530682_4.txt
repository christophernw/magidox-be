The word Devil means resistor, liar.  There is only one Devil mentioned in the bible but he has many angels that follow him and they are called demons.  Jesus kicked Satan out of heaven and he walks among us. He is the ruler of the world for now. But soon, God will take back rulership and put the Devil and the demons into a pit for 1,000 years.  During that time the earth will be restored to paradisiac conditions the way it was for Adam and Eve.

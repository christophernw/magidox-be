The liver has a bunch of functions. Not only does it help to filter things out of the blood, but it also produces cholesterol and stores extra energy that is released to the muscles as glycogen (a kind of carbohydrate). It also plays a role in digestion by interacting with the gall bladder, which is attached to it, but I don't remember exactly what the liver does in that case.

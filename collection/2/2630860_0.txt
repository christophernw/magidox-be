Unreason!. Nobody knows anything about God, I see no reason to imagine a God exists others do but it is purely speculation on their part.. Why would God require to be sexed..the whole idea of God and a God that has a sex is nonsense...if there is only one God who would he be mating with?...it's pure trash and illogic.. . There is no intellectual honesty in evidence with those who claim a God.

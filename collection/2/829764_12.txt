i sing to them (im a guy, who cant sing, at all). . . usually i sing "i will always love youuuuu" by whitney houston.. . i then ask them if they think i could go on american idol.. . if they're still on the phone, i ask them if they'd like to do a duet. . . one woman actually started to sing with me, then i hung up, scared.

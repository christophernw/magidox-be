The Xbox is more powerful than the Playstation 2 and has better looking games and a better online service, but the Playstation 2 has sold a lot more consoles and has a lot more games available for it.  You will have no trouble getting cheap games for both as there are newer versions of each console now (the "Next generation"  -   Xbox 360 has been out for about a year, Playstation 3 has just been released in Japan and US - but not avaialable in UK until March 2007. Nintendo have also just released their new Wii console).. . Check eBay for for console + game combinations, as many people who have either an Xbox or a Playstaion 2 will be selling them with their games to raise cash for the next generation consoles and you will be able to pick up a bargain.  . . Bear in mind that games for both the Xbox and the Playstation 2 will start to dry up as consumers move up the the 360 and PS3.  Both manufacturers have an interest in getting consumers to buy their new hardware, and developers will be concentrating more on the new consoles and the supply of games will trickle down to nothing for the Xbox and the PS2 in the next year or two.. . I suggest you try and play a few games on both console to get a feel for which you prefer, after all it's the games that matter rather than the brand name.  There are hundreds or games already released on both consoles.. . Either way, both consoles have a lot to offer (I've owned both) and you'll have a lot of fun with either!

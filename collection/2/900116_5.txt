In some cases, an animal's nose can change with age. For instance I had a purebred lab that had a litter of perfectly healthy puppies, but one had a very pale nose unlike the rest. I knew there was nothing to worry about, so I waited and her nose gradually turned the normal color. But as for a daily change in coloring of the nose it may be weather. Have you noticed that when a child plays in the snow, he/she's nose will turn a red color? If not that it may just be her breed type. I wouldn't worry about it, but if you feel that it's a threat to your feline, seek veterinary attention. However, here is an answer from an actual veterinarian: Changing of the colour of your cat's nose is just likely to be a change in the pigmentation as they get older. A darker pigment is actually usually healthier since it offers more protection from the sun. However as long as it doesn't get an ulcerated or raised and bleeding appearance that doesn't heal, then it is likely fine. . . Other causes include possible previous trauma and healing (e.g. a cat scratch or fight wound).. . In any case if you are at all concerned, you should have it checked out by your regular vet.

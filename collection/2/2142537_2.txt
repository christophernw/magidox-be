you will take this as strange and not sure if it will work this long after the fact....but when I worked food industry this was taught to me and I've used it numerous times w/ GREAT results.. . normally your burn a finger tip so I would just squeeze a handful of chopped onions or green peppers.  the natural juices in them help cure a burn, take away the sting and aid in healing it fast.. . since its feet....I would get some of either green peppers or onions, which you can handle, and mince them up in a blender, get like a sink dish pan and put them in there and then soak your feet in them, smear the mush all over the burns and let it sit for a while, up to an hour if you can.. . I know this sounds nutty.....but if done at time of burn....the next day you will almost have no blister and within minutes the pain is gone.  again not sure if this will work later on....but whats a few dollars on green peppers to try.. . As the Bible states.....all that man needs for food, shelter, and medicine is on this earth.....pills are not from this earth but created by man

Although I'm not atheist myself(I'm Christian), I'd like to try to answer this question too.. .  I think one of the reasons why atheists go after Christianity more than any other religion, is because most other religions, atheists can still practice, inspite of not believing in God/gods.. .  The only other religions besides Christianity that are not compatible whatsoever with atheism are Islam & most likely Bahai & Shinto(since Shinto means 'Way of the gods').. .  All the other religions such as Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Judaism, Sikhism, Jainism, Hinduism, Universalism, & Zoroastrianism can still be practiced faithfully by those professing to be atheists.

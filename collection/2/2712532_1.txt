The word Noon comes from the middle ages word. Non. [Middle English non, from Old English nōn. It was derived from the canonical hour of nones (3 P.M. in early Middle Ages), from Late Latin nōna (hōra), ninth (hour after sunrise), nones, or of Latin nōnus, ninth.]. It's a very old word from early England around 400ad. Why we use that word dose not make any sense because it use to refer to a time later in the day around 3pm.

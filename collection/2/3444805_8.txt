Could be PMS, but if you're within the first few weeks of conception, no pregnancy test in the world is going to give you a good answer.  At about 6 weeks from your first missed cycle, go to the doctor and ask for a blood pregnancy test; this will be the most accurate, and the soonest you'll know.  Then again, some women never produce a detectable amount of the HCG hormone, in which case you'll know about the time you get bizarre cravings for pickles and ice cream.. Edit: also, the person above me needs a good medical journal, or at least a pamphlet.  That is the most retarded answer I've ever heard.

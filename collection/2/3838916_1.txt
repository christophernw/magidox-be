How much water are you talking about?  If someone has put water in your tank, you might have to drop the tank and remove the water.  On some cars you can enter the tank thru the vent line, and pump the water out.  In some cases, the water might have entered your exhaust system.  Which means you have to open your exhaust sys to warm the engine to operating temperature.  Once the car is running you can then reconnect your exhaust and blow the water out of it.. . Good Luck

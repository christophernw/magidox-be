Depending where you live... If in Canada go to http://www.cbsc.org/ibp or interactive business planner. It all comes in an easy workbook and step by step plans to ensure that everything is well thought out and properly planned. If you live somewhere else go and see an independant business owner and ask them how they did it. You would be surprised by how many people are willing to see others become just as successful as they are.

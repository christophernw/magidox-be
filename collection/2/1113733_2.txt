Do not attempt to work on any car with an airbag unless you are properly trained, I have personally remove many airbag type steering wheels - these devices are deadly in the wrong hands, and don't think if you disconnect things that it is no longer operative as many are designed with a residual power source or a mechanical activation which will fire the airbag independantly from the car.

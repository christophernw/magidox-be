i used to work for an airline.  it may not be necessary for you to attend any type of training school for flight attendant, depending on your previous experience and the airline.  some airlines will hire first their own customer service agents for these positions, but if not enough they will hire from the street.  check out websites for airlines and they will tell you if they are hiring at this time or if you can apply even if you are not.  some type of customer service experience helps and so does a second language, and of course any travel experience or background.  good luck.

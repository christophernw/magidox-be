its a "sphere" so to speak...so it does have a radius... . the problem is that since it spins, its a bit wider at the equator..so you need to specify the radius at that location or the polar radius.... . most ppl care about the equatorial radius.. . the Earth's equatorial radius, or semi-major axis, is the distance from its centre to the equator and equals 6,378.135 km (≈3,963.189 mi; ≈3,443.917 nmi).

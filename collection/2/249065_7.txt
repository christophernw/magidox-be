Not all women are like that!!! You are over generalizing about US!! Sounds to me like you are picking the wrong type of women. And if you are excluding the women in your family from being that way make sure they really are not like that. Because chances are if if all women are the way you said then your mom and sister and aunt are too. But what I think is that you are just picking the wrong kind of women..because I am pretty sure I am not like that and  lot of girls I know are not as well...

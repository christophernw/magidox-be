It took years to build the ark, and I'm sure that during that time, Noah and his family stored food up for the animals. Did you also know that some animals were taken 7 by 7 instead of 2 by 2? It was because there were to be animals eaten after the flood; mankind had been vegetarians up until then! And that perhaps one reason that the people of Noah's day didn't believe him about a flood coming is because it had never rained? There was only a mist over the earth up until the flood.  Cool, huh?

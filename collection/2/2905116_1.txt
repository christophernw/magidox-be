This question has been asked since the beginning of human society.  There's no get tall quick scheme that will make you taller (except antigravitational forces... astronauts up in space do come home an inch or two taller, but then they settle back down after a month or two).  . . Just be patient, eat a nutritional diet, and tell yourself that a positive self image shouldn't be based on height.

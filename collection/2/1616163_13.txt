It all depends on weather you are gaining weight or not,  Think of your skin as leather, it stretches.  If you are putting on more weight, it will become dryer.  I you are maintaining your weight, lotion and frequent bathing should help.  Believe it or not, we are like reptiles, and we need to shed our skin too.  LOL

Behind the myth is a reality.. . Lincoln, like most politicians today, believed that democracy is a luxury that should only be enjoyed by superior people who think just as you do (as he did). When the vast majority of citizens of the South chose the option to secede (to which they had a perfect legal right) rather than suffer more abuses by the Congress, he decided to put democracy aside and force his way of thinking on all Americans by waging war.  Over one million Americans were casualties of that war, a war that continued to cause ill-feeling and torment 100 years later.. ...that Government of a fascist clique by the armed forces and for a small circle of businessmen and politicians shall not perish....    Lincoln was a clever, self-interested, bible-thumping lawyer who unfortunately gained the nomination of one of two political organizations (parties) that dominate our Democracy and became President..    Fortunately he is the only one to do so to date that can be considered a mass murderer of Americans.

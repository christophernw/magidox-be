water is made up of MANY MANY particles. these particles are bouncing around, the more heat, the more they bounce. at room temperature, not many particles in the water have enough energy to 'bounce' out of the cup, however, wen bouncing randomly you do get the odd particle that bounces out of the water. and ofcourse the more water you have the more 'odd' particles you have bouncing out. the hotter the water is the more energy the particles have, and so even at 99 degrees many particles will be bouncing out of the water.. . thers your answer. jus so you know: i am 16, and learnt this in school.

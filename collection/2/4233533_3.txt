When I joined the London Police in 1966 I was just over 5'7'' tall.  The City of London Police were all well over 6feet.  While dealing with a strike on the City/Met boundary we got mixed up with the City officers.  Two of the biggest men I have ever known, they were about 7 feet tall and weighing 20 stone each, picked me up under the arms and walked around with me shoulder high with them.  It was a pity that my feet were about 2 feet from the ground......

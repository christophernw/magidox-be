I am probably not the best person to explain the evolution of the Earth.  But from what I know it is a rather complicated phenomenon.  Partly due to plate tectonics--the movement of the continental plates,  impacts of meteorites, climatic changes such as the ice ages and perhaps even by the bombardment  of cosmic rays on the Earth. Also the natural selection of life forms--survival of the fittest.

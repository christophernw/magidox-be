People can stop smoking! Once the nicotine is out of your system  (about a week)it is just a matter of breaking the habit of smoking. It is like any other habit that you have done over and over again for years it takes time to break the habit. How often have you lit a cigarette and you were not even conscious that you had lit it. HABIT. You can quit.

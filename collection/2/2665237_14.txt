A prefrontal lobotomy is where they surgically remove part of the prefrontal cortex of the brain (the part that is responsible for much of the emotive personality). It was done to inhibit extreme personality disorders, and in the past was frequently used to control psychotic behaviour. No longer performed, as it's pretty barbaric, and irreversible.. . I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy.

i done so much reasearch on this topic and i have come up with a conclution. the reason why that drug is illigal is because of social order. in aperfect world every one is in there 5 sences how ever drugs that alter the state of mind are aproblem they impead some one from acting rationaly causing problems that cost people and or the governent more money for instance if it where leage people would be high all over and it would become a big problem not to mention that it is adicting and well we dont want people dieing from smoking or just because everyone is doing it. this is what i concluded but then again this is my view and this is the phycological trouth behing all this its all about perfection. well i hope i answered it right take care. sincerly.

In Western societies, presumably retired elderly people feel somewhat frustrated at their lack of a job, feeling as if they're somehow useless now and can no longer contribute to the community.  They may also feel intense frustration as their physical body decays faster than their mind, only contributing to an overall negative self-image.  Furthermore, they may encounter ageism in the workplace (as referenced here: http://www.aarp.org/research/international/perspectives/may_03_agediscrimination.html)

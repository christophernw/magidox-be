According to unverified informations, there is a Document called 'Protocals', perhaps of ZionistChristians andJews. Their long term planning was stated to be  defacing all Muslim countries by 1910, in order to let 'prophesies' fulfill! So one and the other excuse was coined to attack and subdue one by one all the countries with some Musliminfluence. Apparently now,  Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, and Afghans had no means to attack any western country. Yet the war goes on. The cause may be religious, not oil. No oil in Afghanistan. However this answer is based on hearsay,on conjectures. May be a food for thoughts!

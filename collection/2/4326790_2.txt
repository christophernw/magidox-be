LOVE IT AND KEEP LOVING IT.. Best way to pass is to enjoy and then doing the work will not be such a chore. I know this sounds really sad, but i really love maths! And it makes it so much fun, it's not a chore at all.. Basically, I agree with Jennifer J.. Make sure you do loads of work and ask your teacher for extra problems. This might make you feel you'll appear uncool in front of your classmates, but you'll pass the exams and they'll fail. Who's cool then?

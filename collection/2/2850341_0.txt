Your question was most likely removed because it didn't serve any beneficial purpose to the Yahoo Answers community. The purpose of this service is for people to ask meaningful questions (why they keep asking why the sky is blue, I'll never know) and get answers that may or may not be easily attained. Yahoo prefers questions with answers that have a little more thought and directly contribute to improving one's knowledge. Your question, unfortunately, does not.

I didn't know that was the case.. Animals were domesticized by humans and used for hunting, for agricultural tasks and even for mere pleasure. One can see animals on ancient pottery and in the hieroglyphs.. Animals have been imitated in dances and acrobatics for thousands of years.. In my opinion, animals had a greater effect in the development of human culture than plants.

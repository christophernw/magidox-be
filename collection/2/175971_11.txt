The "rules" of Christianity are LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOU LOVE YOURSELF.  It's the great commandment given by Christ.  It includes the 10 commandments since if you follow the great command you will have to follow the 10.  Thou shalt not commit adultry still stands!!  That means having sex outside marriage as God ordains it - between one man and one woman.  God bless you and your friend who seems to be misguided.  As was stated - get a bible and read for yourself what is written by Jesus and the apostles (New Testament) regarding how we should behave as Christians.

I think crate training works great.  Just leave the dog in the crate when you can't watch him carefully, then take him outside as soon as you let him out.  Wait until he does his business, then praise him and bring him back inside.  If you see the dog acting like he needs to go when you have him in the house, take him outside until he goes then praise him.

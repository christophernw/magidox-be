Alcohol and smoking products rake in too much cash and contribute to the American economy. . You must be one of those nutcases who want church and state to be together. I hate people like that. And so do our forefathers.. Anyway, as people above have said, alcohol is not prohibited in the Bible. Smoking is never mentioned in the Bible.. I think you forget that Christianity is not the national religion of the US. When the legislative branch tries to pass laws, do you think they take a quick look in their Bibles to guide their decisions?

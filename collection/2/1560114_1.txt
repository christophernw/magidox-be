Because when you take a drag of a smoke the smoke is entering all the capiliaries in you lungs clogging them from allowing oxygen to enter your heart and blood  then all those carcinigens have entered your blod stream and infecting all your cells in all your muscles, your organs, your skin.  You only get one life.  And most smokers will say "you have to die sometime", but "if youre gonna live it should be a healthy life"

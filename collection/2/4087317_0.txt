Certain materials, when cooled to very near absolute zero, experience a transition into a region of zero resistance to current flow. Since the goal of having a superconductor is usually to have a greater capacity to carry current with a smaller cross sectional area, you necessarily experience a greater magnetic field. Any current produces a magnetic field that is related to that current by the Biot-Savart law.

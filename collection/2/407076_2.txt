to determine whether an acid or a base is soluble in say the universal polar solvent water, u should be knowing whether the substance is strong or weak. now bases like NaOH, CsOH, RbOH, Mg(OH)2 are strong bases and in solution they give us the cations and anions(mostly the hydroxyl grp). bases like Be(OH)2, Fe(OH)2 or 3, Cu(OH)2 or any of their oxides are weak and hence in solution they do not undergo complete dissociation and most of these are insoluble. so in case ur not in a lab, the only way is to identify their degree of weakness

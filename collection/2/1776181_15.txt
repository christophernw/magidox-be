The other advice here is good as far as it goes, but the thing to keep in mind is that airlines are getting rid of flight attendants left and right, and those that are kept on are being asked to work longer and longer hours for less and less money.  Being a flight attendant used to be a pretty glamouous job.  It isn't one any more.  I can't imagine that most people your age--old enough to have establshed a life for yourself--would find much to like about a job where your pay goes down, your work goes up, and your employer might be bankrupt at any time.

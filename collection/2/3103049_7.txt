Dear,visit a real good specialist,a neurologist.to say accurately is it CFS and fibromyalgia or depression.I am inclined to think that if you not present the symptoms of depression it is more likely you not to suffer from it..and there's so sure solution and also harmless..for CFS is reqiered to be treated simply with the addition of arginine aspartame,so try it..Sargenor is one product which contains it and you can buy it without prescription and has no side effects..Unfortunately,too many specialist don't pay the needed attention and are inclined to superficial answers like too much stress,just a case of depression etc.I really suggest you to try(again I repeat Aspartame is totally free and taken even without a prescription will not harm you)..Sagenor..I suffered from CFS and that helped me within 10 days.I also suffered from depresson and can tell there's a great difference between them!! Good luck and if you need more info or whatever I'll be glad to answer you!!

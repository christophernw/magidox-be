Actually, its a crime in Germany to even MENTION Hitler's name. They are not proud of their heritage over there, and it seriously is not popular to be a Nazi in Germany. It will get you killed there... . . As for "funny", I find nothing amusing about extremism - regardless of what end of the extreme your located at. White supremecy makes me just as ill as tree hugging love-alls. Hitler wouldnt accept anyone that didnt have blond hair or blue eyes. Which is strange, cuz he was Austrian, had short brown hair and dark eyes. Hypocrite! . . My fav quote is from Hitler: "What good fortune for Governments that the People do not think." And, just for the record, Hitler got the idea to exterminate Jews from AMERICA - we were performing eugenics on our own peple at that time, sterilizing gays, mentally ill and criminals to prevent the spread into society. We abondonned the idea when Hitler started using it.

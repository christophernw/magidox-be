No offense but your question does not make any sence, but I belive you are asking why in pictures are gnomes or other types of fairies depicted sitting on mushrooms, well probably because the belive that *fairy rings* are magical thought to mark the place of a fairy dwelling. And the fact that fairies are always thought to be rather small in stature, and a mushroom fits them quite well.

Look into Brownian motion, it is responsible for diffusion.  That was Einstein's famouse papers in 1905.  As for the presentation maybe microscopic cells have to be seen in order to prove.  Now I know that in the anatomy of living things there is also diffusion taking place I sometimes get it confused with osmotic pressure differential, but you can check out the small intestine and the diffusion of nutrients into the body.  This is another idea.

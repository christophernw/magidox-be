It isn't. Most people just think that it is. If you allow sexual desires to dominate you, you are more likely to make poor decisions when choosing a mate because you may only decide by how someone looks. You may be happy with them for a while, but if you realize you have little in common & once the initial attraction wears off, most likely you will going looking for someone else.. When you do not go by sexual attraction, you are able to see clearer & will be able to make better decisions. You may not date as often, but you are happier with the people that you do date.

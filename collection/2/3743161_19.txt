He isn't! In fact one of the reasons he went to Iraq was to make sure there will be a supply of oil in addition to kicking Hussein's a*s! Fact is world oil production has peaked and no major reserves of oil have been found in 35 years. Oil will only go up in price due to the laws of supply and demand. Supply is slowly going away thus demand is driving prices up and always will.. Whether you like Bush or not he isn't responsible for the world oil situation.

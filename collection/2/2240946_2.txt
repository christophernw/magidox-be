walking.. NOT RUNNING would be your best. if you're running your putting more strain and weight on your leg muscles hence building them more. Also when in front of the tv put your legs out level (supported by a foot rest) and poing your toes forward. Do this in high reps with low sets. (for example do it 50 times, stop relax for a minute or two then do it again)

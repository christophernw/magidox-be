Confessions always heal.  If you are talking about confessing something like cheating on your wife, you already did the spliting a long time ago.  Dishonesty, lies, secrets; these are the things that split.  Confessions may not join two people back together after these things have occured, but it allows both parties to heal, however that healing must be accomplished.

If a man loves a woman it is easy to see, it is the way he talks to her, does he say nice things to her or does he criticise her, Does he do things for her, when she asks, like give me a massage or something and if he does not mind , then surely he loves her. Does he want to do things with her and be seen with her, holding hands and all that stuff, Men will not say I love you day in or day out, it is the little things they do.. . . For a woman if you want you man to continue to love you must    show him that you are independent and capable of being without him, that he is important to you but not the centre of you life.. . there is no rules for the game of love, men can be deceiving  and woman even more so, tender words can be spoken by both but without meaning. . . The game of love is played knowing well that it can end up anywhere, in happiness or despair. Make the most of what you have and if the person you have makes you happy then take that and make it more, if you seek money, looks or material possession, then these things do not go with love.. . love is a quality without these , for you can have money, the handsome guy and the nice cars, but you might not have love. . love doesn't mean you have to be poor and struggling either, it means that you have what you have when you have it and to strive with you partner to have together a little bit more each day or week or month or year, and to grow and become successful together will result in true happiness. To find a man to do this is the trick, but sometimes you need not look far to find such a person, people you grow up , that you know all you life are sometimes the ones we miss out on.. . To find true love is to know that love is plenty , you can love as many people you want, you however can only be initmate with one at a time, that's the rules of the game.. Do not seek that another loves you, but rather love them instead.

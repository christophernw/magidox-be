The velocity of sound dpends   upon the elastic properties of the bodies.. . For longitudinal waves this velocity is given by the simple formula:. . c = 1/ (square root of the product of density and compressibility).. . If a substance can be compressed highly it has high compressiblity (e.g air, it can be easily compressed). . Air is highly compressible. . . Hence the speed is very low.. . . Solids have small values of compressibility. . . Hence the velocity of sound is greater in solids, in general.. . Liquids  have more  copressiblity than solids.. . Hence the velociy is less than in solid.

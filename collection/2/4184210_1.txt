There is nothing wrong with most people and their dogs. There is also nothing wrong with you wanting peace in you're own home. Are these dogs left tied up outside all day? You also have to understand that it is normal for a dog to bark. I person could also feel the same way you do about people, and do you see people getting shocked in order to make them shut up. Talk to your neighbors, or get over it. The police have more important things to deal with besides something that petty.

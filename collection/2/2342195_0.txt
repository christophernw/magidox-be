I have not tried this, but I read on a home remedy site that putting a banana peeling on the bruise helps remove the coloration.  Just peel a banana and remove the banana and place the peeling on it, not sure which side of the peeling works try both, it would not hurt to try. If it works let me know lol Good luck

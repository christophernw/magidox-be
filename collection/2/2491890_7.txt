I STRONGLY disagree with the person who said that this happens to people who do not have God in their life.  This has nothing to do with your personal beliefs.  I have had this experience and know of many people who have also, all of whom were VERY religious and devout people when it happened (including myself).. . However, I can't disregard the possibility that it is biological or neurological.  It would be fascinating to do a study on this subject, because it seems to happen mostly to young adults in their high school years.. . I think the study would have to include not only regular science, but also paranormal scientists.. . It is something real, but since it is something unseen, and unpredictable, it is a very difficult thing to study, and therefore, very difficult to answer.

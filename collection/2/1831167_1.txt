No one man has ever changed the world more than Jesus. We should all live our lives by his example. We all fall far short of that example.. I hate no person on earth and I think it's wrong to kill 30,000 civilians in Iraq. It was also wrong to invade Iraq since they Surrendered after Desert Storm.. Iraq had no planes, no tanks and half it's Army had deserted. They also had no WMD and were not connected to Sept. 11th. in any way. Jesus would not tell such lies. Jesus would also not except the lies as the truth blindly.

"It is appointed for men to die once, and after this comes judgment" (Hebrews 9: 27). "Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all men everywhere should repent, because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead (Acts 17:30-31). When you die, you will be in one of 2 states - either you will be spiritually alive ("this is eternal life - that they may know You (God the Father) the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent" - John 17:3)  OR, you will be spiritually dead - "And you being dead in your trespasses and sins...being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart  - Ephesians 2:1; 4:18).   If you are spiritually alive, your spirit will ascend, attended by the angels of God, into the Paradise of God. If you are spiritually dead, your spirit will descend into the lower parts of the Earth (yes, literally!), and you will find yourself in a place of torment with myriads of other torment souls and countless demons, awaiting the final judgment of God, where every word/thought/deed you have ever committed will be weighed and punishment meted out in direct proportion to your guilt; and you will be cast into a lake of fire.    THIS IS WHY JESUS DIED ! He doesn't want you going there ! But you must repent, call upon His name, and ask Him to save you - and stop listening to all the lying demons that speak into your mind day by day telling you this is just a big fairy tale. Haven't you seen enough evil in the earth yet to realize there are some very serious issues going down ? Don't play games with your soul - the stakes are too high. I'm telling you I know what I say is true - I've had a taste of Hell and a taste of Heaven. Ain't no game - repent, turn around, and belief the Gospel .

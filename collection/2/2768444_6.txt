I suppose you would start with a wet towel and wash him like that,or maybe monkeys like baths .. phone the local zoo and ask what they do with stinky monkeys. . When I wash my cat I've to hold it by the scruff of its neck and avoid claws it only gets bath when really needed.So maybe holding monkey by scruff would work to.

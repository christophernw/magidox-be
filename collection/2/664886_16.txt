I don't "go after" anyone,and I think it's wrong when anyone is hostile about anyone else's religion.Some Christians and Atheists just seem to like going back and forth with each other.I don't take it too seriously anymore.I've seen some "Christians" that get pretty nasty.Not all,but quite a few do it.Same with Atheists.Let's just all worry about something more productive than what someone else believes.That's what I think.

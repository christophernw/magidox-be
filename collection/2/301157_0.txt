A lifter is a device that, in short, helps the pistons move. And I think you are asking can someone who doesn't know how to do it, attemp it, No, take it to an autoshop and have them do it, if you dont know what you are doing you will more then likely not even have any idea where to start or you will just mess up your car to the piont where it is undriveable.

I once read a study about why people, not just woman, get into glamour modelling and the most consistant reason was an unhappychildhood.  That they receivedno, or very little, love and attention and they felt that they were ugly.  We are within a appearence led culture and when you feel particularly vunerable we look to what others have to get attention.  In the media the people who are beautiful get the most attention, so people get into glamour, and everyone tells them how beautiful they are..... but then they feel empty because noone likes them for their personalty.. . Quite a vicous circle!. . mrben

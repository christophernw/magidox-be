As others have already pointed out the coating is a zinc oxide paint which is sprayed on during the manufacture of the exhaust.This is primarily to prevent rust during transportation and storage,after the exhaust is fitted if it is a section close to the engine the paint will burn off within minutes of the engine being started,but will last a lot longer on cooler parts of the system.

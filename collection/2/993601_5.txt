you have to think in the eras mind set . forget today . forget what you see and hear . at that era in time women in general had no rights. so a black woman had even less rights and was considered dis possible sounds hard ?. they were considered "sorry" like cattle. white women were thought of as possessions. at that point on time it was acceptable to beat your wife and kids . it was the mans role and considered personal. "the family's business". as long as no one was killed what a man did in his house was his business and no one had anything to say.. we forget much as time goes on that was what was so great before the television came about.. family's talked at diner people spoke with one another.and everyone had human contact.. people understood times past through stories passed down through generations .. now we have a hard time thinking woh was that possible ?. we have come a long way in the past 5 years . your talking about something that happened much longer.. so that is why it can be hard to comprehend the mindset.. . did this help

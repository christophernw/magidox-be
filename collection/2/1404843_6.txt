I certainly wouldn't call it "audacity"! Those "darn Americans" were speaking that language when they settled America. What were they suppose to do.....make up a whole NEW language because they moved to a whole new country? As for the change of spelling of a number of certain words, it just evolved over time the same way most spelling changes occur.

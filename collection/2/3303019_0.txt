Yes, my cat used to do that.. CATS are a people-oriented creature.. they LOVE to get attention even though they give you the cold shoulder (many times) when you are calling them, etc.  They are independent BUT LOVE ATTENTION when THEY want it and so if you are asleep,,,, they want ot wake you up to scratch them or whatever.

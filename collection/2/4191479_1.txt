Kinda yes. . Here is the 2006 proof about the scene in New Delhi , Metropolitian and the Capital city of India.. . . "Kissing in public has always been a taboo. It was only now that the young couples had started to open-up and did not find anything wrong expressing their love in public.. . But to all those love birds, kissing in public has just gotten 10 times more expensive in India's capital, where they face fines of Rs 500 if they are caught making "illegal use" of public spaces. . . New Delhi's authorities found that a fine of Rs 50 levied under a 1936 law was too little to deter couples. ". . Oh and most public dont own cars, in case you got the idea of a public, but private space.. . So it becomes all the more challenging and lot less lucky

It is far easier to categorise people on our differences, rather than our similarities. Many governments are nationalistic and "immigrants" are blamed for all sorts of things. People are suspicious of languages and customs that are different to theirs and it is easier to lump them all into one group rather than actually discover what each individual believes and is like as a human being. In Australia, where I live, many people grew up under the "White Australia" policy and reserve their most vicious racism for Aboriginal people- I have spent a lot of time dealing with both sides of the fence and most white Australians don't know the most basic thing about Aboriginal culture. The cultural differences are what have caused problems in the past, and they translate into socio-economic issues today, and there is now some degree of viciousness on both sides of the fence. But from what I have seen, it is because it is too hard for people to go out of their comfort zone and explore another culture and actually question their own sense of what determines who they are. We identify most easily with people who look similar to us- it is only if we get the opportunity (or take the opportunity) to meet people who are different that the similarities suddenly overwhelm the differences. Cultural discrimination and racial discrimination are often very different but are often exploited by people for political advantage. . . I have a strong aversion to the policies of the Taleban, for example, but it is not because they are Afghanis. It is because they oppress women.. . It is always good to ask: "Where do i get my sense of identity from?"

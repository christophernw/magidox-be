The truth is that whether you drop the charges or not, the prosecutor still makes the ultimate decision whether or not the state wants to press charges.  This may be totally out of your hands...particularly if he committed some of these offenses against others.  Even if you don't want to testify, if you get subpoenaed, you better show up and whatever you do, do not perjure yourself!

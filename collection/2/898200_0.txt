Newgate was the name of the prison in London.  A Newgate Romance is a romance -- not necessarily a tale of love, but a heightened tale of adventure, etc. -- set in whole or in part in Newgate Prison.   Begining in the 18th Century and continuing later, there were many popular tales about famous highwaymen and bandits who ended up in Newgate, such as Dick Turpin or Jack Sheppard, who at one time broke out of Newgate.

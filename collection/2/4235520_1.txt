gnostic. . . gnosÂ·tic. . . adjective . Definition:.  . of knowledge: relating to knowledge, especially knowledge of spiritual truths. . [Mid-17th century. See Gnostic]. . . . . . . Gnosticism is a historical term for various mystical initiatory religions, sects and knowledge schools that were most active in the first few centuries A.D. around the Mediterranean and extending into central Asia.. . These systems typically recommend the pursuit of mysticism or "special knowledge" (gnosis) as the central goal of life. They also commonly depict creation as a mythological struggle between competing forces of light and dark, and posit a marked division between the material realm, typically depicted as under the governance of malevolent forces (such as the demiurge), and the higher spiritual realm from which it is divided, governed by God (the Monad) and the Aeons.. . As a result of these common traits, allegations of dualism, anticosmism and body-hatred are often raised against Gnosticism as a whole. In some applications, such charges may be justified.. . The terms 'Gnosticism' and 'Gnostic' are most properly applied to modern revivals of these groups. Recently their meanings have grown to include any religious movement incorporating a doctrine of special initiatory knowledge, which may lead to confusion. It is also a common topic in Sinology, as it was the first Christianity introduced to China since the 7th Century.. . . and if u want more info, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnostic. yea...

Dx has basic crank windows, no power anything, sometimes no a/c, standard transmission, black mirrors. Lx is a four door so you can't get it in a coupe, but it has power options (windows, mirrors, locks) and a tachometer, and usually comes in an automatic tranny.. Ex comes with the same options as LX plus sunroof, CD player (sometimes) and Anti-Lock brakes(only on 4 door). Hope that helps

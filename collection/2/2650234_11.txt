THe best thing that helps and is a natural remedy is Vitex agnus castus. Vitex agnus castus is a herb also known as Chaste Tree.  It is a shrub groing in Asia. Other names are Agnus Castus, Chasteberry and Monk's Pepper, from its use in the middle ages to control sexual desire in monks. You can also get it in form of a pill. After you take it for a month, PMS will slowly go away. It also regulates the cycle. It is much better than any birth control pill, as it is not a hormone. I took this for about 2 years and stopped. Now I don't suffer PMS at all.

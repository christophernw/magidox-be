well if you walk down the road and a black cat runs infront of you and you trip over it, its bad luck for you because youve prob skinned your knee or something, but other than that no, ive owned several black cats and the only ones to have bad luck was the cats because they got run over in the dark.. a broken mirror, if you get cut after you break it, yes bad luck, but again just superstition, ive dropped several mirrors, gotten mad and thrown them or whatever, never had bad luck out of them. lol

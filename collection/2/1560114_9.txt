How long have you been smoking?  Why quit now?  Smoking makes you seem more classy and sophisticated, especially if you have one of those nifty cigarette holders like the Penguin had on the old 70's Batman episodes.  People who try to tell you that it's bad for you and that you should quit are just jealous because you look so much cooler than they do.  Don't worry.  They'll come up with a cure for cancer eventually.  Smoke 'em if you got 'em!

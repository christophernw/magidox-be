Americans are in a total dream land if they think we actually make a difference.  Its Pie in the Sky.. . The people who get elected are the ones who can afford the grandest campaign and the people who we really vote in are the companies and organizations who fund them, such as the NRA, oil companies, or whoever else.. . If we made a difference and politicians actually cared about what we want and think, Bush would have never gone into Iraq and people who hire illegals would actually have to pay the $10,000 fine for each illegals they have hired.  Illegals would be deported, more money would be given to education then feel good ads for americanism and american products and the wealthy would be taxed more theh they are.  Taxes would be used wisly and we would only help the countries who really needed it, not the ones who scratch our back.  The ACLU would be put down a notch and Rosanne Barr would never, ever have sang the National Anthem because a law would have been put in place that people who sing that bad would be jailed and gaged before trying to sing it with a microphone.. . Yeah, we make a difference.  We vote in the richest people campainging, not the most qualified.  Its a pipe dream...

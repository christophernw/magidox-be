All he has to do to transfer the check to you is endorse it on the back (signing his name on the end behind the left end of the other side of the check, exactly as his name was given on the front).  You then pay him the amount of the check, and it thus becomes yours.  You are cashing the check for him when you give him cash for the amount of the check upon his endorsement.  But what if someone has written him a "hot" check?  Then you are stuck with it!  So only cash it for him if you KNOW it's good.  Then go deposit it in your account.

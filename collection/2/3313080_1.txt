There are 3 times in a person's life that they will create and store a large amount of fat cells and that is 1) Last month of development in the womb 2) The first year of life and 3) During their growth spurt in adolescence.  Therefore, these fat cells are normal and healthy.  When the child is young it is a matter of that their bodies are sucking every last bit of nutrients from ANYTHING they eat.  Also, during adolescence, the tolls can be seen from unhealthy eating habits.  But the largest factor in everything is metabolism.  When adults (women I'm not so sure about men) reach around 30 yrs old their metabolism decreases and they sometimes put on weight if their exercise routine isn't vigorous enough.  Hope this helps!

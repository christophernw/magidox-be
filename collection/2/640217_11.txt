Hershey used to sell a product called the Tropical Bar, a heat-resistant chocolate bar for situations just such as yours.  I understand they now have a similar product called the Desert Bar which is distributed to troops in the middle east.  Check with camping and outdoor outfitters to see if it is available in your area, or call Hershey directly at 1-800-468-1714.

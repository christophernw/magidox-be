Stands for Universities and Colleges Admission Service.. You basically choose 6 universities and apply for them with your courses and a personal statement.  Some universities are not in the UCAS service, so for those you have to fill out a separate application form from the uni itself.  Its only for UK unis.  . I myself had to apply through UCAS and it is a fairly easy process.  Just have to do research for the right type of uni and course and ask your guidance counsellor for help.. Best of luck with your application.

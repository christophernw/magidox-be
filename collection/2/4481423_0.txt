Travel to Athens Greece sometime and you'll get the visual on why loans are needed.. . To paint the picture 4 u ... Imagine you're rich and you want to build a 20 story building ... you have 10 Million Dollars to do this and you start the project ... well oil prices rise, cement tripples in cost, and workers sue you ...

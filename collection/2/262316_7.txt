White people are allowed to go to black colleges and on to be on BET. As a matter of fact a white man owns BET!  You make a lot of generalizations. I do not think that all whites are racist and I am a black person. Racism is real. Not all people are racist, but some people are. Black people as well as other races have traditionally had to deal with a lot of racism and they do harbor a lot of bitterness. I am not sure as to a solution to this problem.

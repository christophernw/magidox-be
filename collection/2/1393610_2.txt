HERBERT HOOVER WAS A ECONOMIC GENIUS.. NOTE-HARRY TRUMAN ONCE SAID "IF PRESIDENT HOOVER HAD 6 MORE MONTHS IN OFFICE HE HAD DEVELOPED A PLAN THAT WOULD NOT ONLY FEED ALL HUNGRY AMERICANS,BUT WOULD HAVE FED ALL THE STARVING MASSES IN EUROPE & IN DOING SO WOULD HAVE JUMP STARTED THE AMERICAN ECONOMY.(However Harry Truman headed up the most corrupt administration in US HISTORY,He was loyal to a fault protecting his friends & cronies,He holds the record to this day of having more cabinet & staff members indicted & Convicted in his terms in office)(Plus He did'nt have the guts to allow (Supreme commander)& General Douglas MacArthur To solve our now Infamous North Korea problem,& Chinas abuse of the Yalu River,& denied MacArtur the right of Hot Pursuit,thereby LEAVING US THE PROBLEM OF DEALING WITH NORTH KOREA & CHINA,PLUS After he fired macArthur Unfortunately Truman was not Impeached,even though it was seriously considered. . FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT HOWEVER GAVE PEOPLE PRIDE & MADE JOBS SO PEOPLE DID'NT FEEL WORTHLESS & ACTUALLY EARNED A PAYCHECK.. MY GRANDFATHER WAS A WELDER,MECHANIC & DROVE TRUCKS,yet could'nt find a job,UNTIL THE WPA was created & opened an office in TAMPA,they built AMORYS FOR THE MILITARY,REPLACED ROADS THAT WERE NEAR PERFECT,BUILT BUILDINGS A MACDILL AFB,BRIDGES ETC,ROOSEVELT ALSO CREATED THE SAFETY NET"Social Security.Untill that time UNLESS YOU WERE WEALTHY. WHEN YOU GOT OLD YOU WERE FORCED TO LIVE WITH YOUR FAMILY,WHO EVER WOULD TAKE YOU.. ITS BELIEVED ONE OF ROOSEVELT REASONS FOR GIVING BRITIAN,RUSSA & CHANG KAI SHEIK(china) OUR SHIPS,TANKS,WEAPONS,WAS SIMPLY WHEN WE FINALLY WENT TO WAR. WE WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE ALL THESE SHIPS,TANKS ETC.. (1-We modernize our weapons,2-KICK OUR MANUFACTURING SECTOR INTO OVERDRIVE.SO WHAT HOOVER CAREFULLY PLANNED,TO ALLOW THE MARKET TO KICK IN & CORRECT ITSELF,ROOSEVELT WENT DIRECTLY HANDS,(WHAT FASTER WAY TO GET AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAN TO GET INTO A WAR WAR) ON DIRECTLY INTO THE ECONOMY,PLUS WE STILL CAN'T PROVE THAT ROOSEVELT DID'NT HOLD THE WARNING OF THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR,THRUSTING US INTO THE WAR.. THE BOTTOM LINE REALLY IS WHY DID WE HAVE THE GREAT DEPRESSION? SIMPLE I BELIEVE CALVIN COOLEGE WAS IN OFFICE PRIOR TO HOOVER,HE WAS A DO NOTHING PRESIDENT WHO NEVER SOLVED A PROBLEM,HE WAITED & SIMPLY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN,BUT DID'NT GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN.

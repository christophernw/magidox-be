Watching the mouth has nothing to do with reading...They watch the mouth to learn how to speak and pronounce words.  Because we can hear, we assume they have to hear the sound to be able to read the word- not so!  When I taught, I used both sign language and picture flashcards with the word written below it to help my hearing impaired students to learn a words meaning.  Remember- words are only symbols.  Teach them the symbols' meaning and they will be able to read.

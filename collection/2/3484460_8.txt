A yawn gives your brain an extra supply of oxygen in order to ward off going mental wandering.  This is why we frequently yawn when doing a boring task that we have to stay alert for.  . . As to why we can yawn just by thinking about it or seeing someone else, I believe it is because it is triggered by visual stimuli, whether you see it with your eyes, or "see" it in your mind.

If I understand you correctly, then we agree. I have always resisted the one name to describe a person phenomena. Life and people are much too complicated to be given a single label. Our society is largely an impatient one and some people aren't adept at enunciating how they feel. Like me, in high school I was sports oriented and was called a jock, but I was on the school editorial staff and was called a bookworm, when I partied, I was a burnout. So, having a single word to describe me or anyone else was absurd and the folly of the close-minded set.

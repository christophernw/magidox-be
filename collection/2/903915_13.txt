We are perfect - I don't see any humans who might have evolved different organs, or for that matter any humans who are still evolving from monkeys (although some on these questions appear that they might have!). . God made us perfect - our sense organs have not needed any tweaks or replacements.. . If it is illness, disease or deformities you are concerned about then this is due to man not obeying God's commandments.

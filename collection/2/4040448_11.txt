" I was born 4 this " i cringed.. let alone how such an rigged election was allowed 2 happen in the first place!  how the US can expect 2 export democracy, when they do not have it themselves is damn hypocritical and the irony of the whole situation!. they worship him as now's a bit late 2 back away from the president of the USA! . try not 2 let it upset u.  . he'll get his, mayb not 2day, not 2moro but 1 day it will all come crashing down around him.. iraq will haunt him, his family, his friends and his admin.. and yes i know he un-signed the geneva convention ( amongst others ) and denounced the UN, so the invasion of iraq wasn't illegal 4 his administration. but 1 day he'll answer 2 a much higher power than mortal man!. & i have 2 believe that, have 2.

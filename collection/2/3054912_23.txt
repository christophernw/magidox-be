Shut the F$%$^%$ up!!!. I read the question that told me to come to this question. DUDE!!!!!!!!!. You shouldn't be eating anymore than 1400 calories.. And you should be walking 2 miles per DAY!. I get irritated with people like you. I HAVE spinal injuries,It hurts my SPINE to do activities because of my injuries...NOT because I eat too much.. I was a gymnast and have always been in shape until my injury..I have put on 40 lbs - lost 10- without the ability to go for a walk.. BITE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

we know that the speed if earth is decreasing after every 100 years by certain amount, after a very long time earth should stop rotatin around the sun,and some say it will begin to rotate the other way around, thats why in Islam in the judgement day main signs sun will rise from east instead of west , some say in this momentary stop gravitional forces between earth and sun are not in equilibrium because there is not centrifugal force but centripidal forces =mv^2/r and then booooom crash

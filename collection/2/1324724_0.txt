That first answer works fine if you are a Christian. But if you have a different faith, it means nothing. However, the basic premise is correct. Jesus did say to love everyone. And when we love everyone, we try to ensure that we treat them well... without prejudice, racism, unkindness, etc. . . I also felt it was my duty to raise kids who would be contributors to society so the next generation would have some positive people.

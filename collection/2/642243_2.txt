Let's see if I may be of help to your niece. I truly believe a government official is honest when he or she shares their personal background publicly. They are someone who listens with their heart, takes the time to meet with you, and really analyze the issue at hand. They are not afraid to speak on your behalf, and looks into the issues closely. Overall, their honesty shows within their attitude, positive behavior and actions. Hope this helps.

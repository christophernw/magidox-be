i can't tell u why we are cranky during menopause(i haven't gone thru menopause yet) but i can tell u why we are cranky during our periods. it's because we are cramping and we feel like we are bloated and fatter than usual. if u are a guy and wondering why a female close to u is really mean to u during her menopause/period(menstrual cycle)...it's probably because she is feeling physical pain and she needs to get rid of that pain somehow.  just try to stay out of her way and buy her lots of ice-cream...cookie 'n cream ice cream always helps me deal with pain. lol.

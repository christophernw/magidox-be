Picture this....Someone has slaved for hours and hours over makeing a meal. All the guests are there. Its getting late, but for some reason the main course just wont finish cooking. Oh No!!! They have eaten all the bread sticks, they are getting cranky, and the whole dinner party feels like it has just stalled!! Our cook only needs just a little more time. What does our cook do??? . . Send out the dinner salad :). . It could have been the very start of this trend :)

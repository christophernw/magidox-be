I know exactly where you are coming from.  Read my answer to your other question.  If you want to know about blood transfusions, research the topic thoroughly and come to an informed decision.  The Bible has a little to say about blood, like pouring it out after an animal is killed, but they obviously weren't operating on people back then.  It also says blood represents life. There's tons of info. available for you to quench your curiosity on, if that is what you are really after.  Just don't wait till the last minute to fight the issue over with doctors if your mind is not made up over the issue.

Gravity (theoreticly) is caused by gravitons... they are a massless particle that travel between objects causeing the force we know as gravity... It can also be thought of as gravitational waves... but either way it is still a physical thing and actualy because it is massless it by deffinition travels at the speed of light. . . Thus the speed of gravitiational effect is the speed of light

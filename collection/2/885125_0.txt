sometimes older ( 9-10 year old cats) have this problem,. our "boy"  had a problem about 2 months ago.. we took him to the vet. it was costly ($200) and did not help.. we found our own answer on the internet. We gave him milk and Pumpkin from pumpkin pie mix.. We also started him on soft cat food.  He had been on Hills science diet. now he gets a little bit of hard cat food every day, but most of his diet is soft.  He is doing great!!!

Actually you're right.  When F2 was initially isolated, it kept reacting w/ the storage vessels...displacing other less electronegative elements (like Cl).  Eventually someone figured out to use a flourinated salt for storage, and voila, isolated AND stored.. . Today there are materials that are virtually inert to F2, but that's because chemistry progressed w/ clever ideas like the one above.

"GOMEREARLE" is so incredibly wrong, it hurts. ANY puppy (breed makes no difference) should be vaccinated between 6-8 weeks. Maternal antibodies are still circulating before this age bracket so vaccinating before then is useless ( NO MATTER WHAT BREEDER'S SAY....BREEDER'S ARE NOT DOCTORS). Start with the Canine "combo" vaccine that has the following:. Distemper. Parvo. Lepto. Parainfluenza. Coronavirus. Hepatits. Adenovirus type 2. (all these will be in the same injection). . then every 21 days, your puppy should be boostered with the distemper combo as well as bordetella, giardia, rabies (between 12-16 weeks) and lyme disease if you live in a tick-infested area. . the final set of vaccines should be given when the puppy is between 18-22 weeks old. also remember to gt your puppy's stool checked until you have 2 negative tests in a row. start on heartworm prevention at 8 weeks and don't forget about flea control. a spay/neuter surgery is recommended between 4-6 months, depending on how big your puppy is. if you don't plan on showing or breeding your dog (there are 20 million puppies and kittens put to death every year that don't have homes), then GET IT FIXED. Not only does this reduce the risk of accidental puppies, it greatly aids in the health and longevity of your dog. A spayed female with reduce her risk of breast cancer (yes it does happen), uteran cancer, and a dangerous uteran infection called pyometra that can kill a dog. a neutered male will be less likely to escape to go mate, go mark on your furniture and territory, be aggressive, and will reduce his risk for testicular cancer, and enlarged prostate (prostatic hypertrophy). . the first 6 months is very busy and can be expensive, but a healthy, happy puppy is SO worth it. . GOOD LUCK!

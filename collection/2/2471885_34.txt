I like what Zen said...the two words have the same written definition. She looks at the Latin roots.. Although with out looking at the definition, apprehension seems to be more or a fear, whereas comprehension is an understanding. So apprehension may be getting it but not understanding it :and comprehension is getting it but understanding it as well.. . Example: A cop "apprehends" a suspect (catches him for shoplifiting). Once he catches him and talks to him he understands that he is homeless and needed the food that he stole to survive. The cop now "comprehends" the suspects actions.  . . Zen has you looking at the root of the words which is a good way to start.

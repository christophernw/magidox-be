The cop only got into a "little trouble" as you put it, EVERY officer has the POWER of DISCRESSION if they believe that a warning will do, that the person has been removed from harm then the officer can consider his/her job done well. . No superior officer can make ANY officer override their decision, if the superior officer believes action should be taken then that superior officer should take the action. . Some cops are by the book to "cover their arse" due to stupid complaint like this one and others do it because its the law and they have a duty of care for the person and others.

First of all, everything rotates.  . . You can actually measure the rotation of a star, including our Sun, by looking at the light from each side through a prism.  Hyrdogen absorbs classic double bands in the red section of the spectrum.  But the Doppler effect means that light will be shifted toward blue in things approaching you, and shifted toward red in things moving away from you.  It is actually possible to take a spectrum of one side of the Sun and then of the other and calculate how fast it is rotating by the difference in the shifting of the spectrum.. . We also have videos that show the Sun rotating.

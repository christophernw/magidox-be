A heating pad works wonders. If you do not have a heating pad you can make one. Simply wet a wash cloth don't ring it out to much leaving it kind of dripping but not to much and microwave it for 1 min. Be careful as it will be hot when taking it out. put it in a plastic bag(zip lock) of some sort and put it on the area where you are crampy the most. it's great to travel with too I wore it in side my underwear and put on jeans to keep it in place and went out were ever I had to go. It was great almost like those heat therapy pads they sell these days. Hope this helps

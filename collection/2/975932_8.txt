There's a variety of reasons. Maybe the person is someone who doesn't have a reason for getting up in the mornings. Not being employed is another reason, so why get up early?. It might be just a habit they have, or they might take sleeping pills to make sure they sleep. My g/f rarely sees the light of day before 10am every day AND she always takes a sleeping pill 'just in case'. I don't agree with her Dr. giving her these pills all the time, but I'm not in his office with her when she talks to him so I don't know what she's telling him. Very few Drs will prescribe any sort of sleeping pills beyond a 10-day period. Over time, the body will become dependent on those pills, and the person will have difficulty in getting to sleep naturally.. Laziness is another reason. The person might wake up, then decide to go back to sleep because there isn't any encouragement for them to get up.

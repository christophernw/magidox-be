There is a quantum gravity theory that suggests that gravitational field would be transmit ed by Gravitons, hypothetical masless particles that travel at the speed of light. There are inconsistences in this theory that haven't been resolved yet.. Nevertheless it is belived that gravity has a speed, and that would be the speed of light. Time and space would behave in a similar way with all natural forces.. . . Look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton

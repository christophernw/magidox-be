Either your battery is dead (will not hold a charge) or your alternator is bad (it will not charge your battery).  Most auto parts stores will check both for free.. . In the old days before there were so much electronics on cars, you could jump start a car and it would run until you turned it off then it would have to be jumped again to start.  Nowadays if either the battery or the alternator is bad, the car will not stay started even after being jump started.

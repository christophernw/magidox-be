Organic LCD crystals are grown.  When a current is passed through them instead of only generating a color (requiring a backlight to make the color visible) the organic LCD crystals also generate light or luminence with that color.. . Also, this type of LCD is much more efficient because it doesn't take much energy to get it give off color + light elliminating the need for a backlight.  The backlight in LCD devices is where a lot of the power goes right now.  . . Imagine if your cell phone would last for hours more just because the screen was more efficient... or your handheld PDA or gaming system... pretty exciting stuff.. . Go to those links others gave you for more information. I just wanted to give you the short summary version.

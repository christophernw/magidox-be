Well based on your avatar you say ten years, so I am assuming that you are ten years old. Forgive me if I am wrong, but I am going to write to you like I would to a ten year old. .      You are ten. No you will not always worry for the rest of your life. You are just worrying about some things right now. Whatever is bothering you you need to tell an adult about it. Tell your parents or some adult you trust what is on your mind. Everybody thinks about bad stuff sometimes because sometimes bad things happen!  .      What you have to do is start thinking about good things and all the things that you like. If you do that when you are feeling bad about something then you will forget about the bad things pretty quickly. .      Still though tell some adult that you trust about what you are feeling. I promise they will help you.

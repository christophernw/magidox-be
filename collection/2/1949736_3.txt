Active transport is the movement of something against its gradient across a membrane (from areas of low concentration to areas of high concentration).  This process usually may involve a protein specific to the molecule that is being transported (such as carrier proteins) and it always involves energy of some kind, whether it be a membrane potential (the voltage difference across a membrane), ATP, GTP, etc.

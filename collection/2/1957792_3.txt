Moslims say so because Great Mohammad WAS the Greatest of all.It is written in Quran.Besides you can see how much christians respect their prophet Great Jesus and how much the followers of Moses do(Jews).Only Moslims truly love and respect their prophet that is the proof of his greatness.And Moslims also love and respect other prophets like Moses,Jesus,Abraham etc.But not equal to Mohammad.Moslims do respect other prophets because they are not like Christians who neither respect their own prophet nor prophets of Moslims or others.

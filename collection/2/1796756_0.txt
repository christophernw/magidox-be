The Underground Railroad was arguably the foundation of the Civil Rights Movement.  That is, people risked being jailed to help free others.  This is normally thought of as whites helping escaped blacks, but free blacks were also heavily involved.  A basic idea of the Civil Rights Movement is to have the courage to violate unjust laws in order to get them changed, and to risk going to jail for what you believe in.

Girls go for the whole badboy routine, the whole "I live my life on the edge" thing. I've never heard of them being attracted to male death row killers, but hey anything is possible. They also think that since the guy is so reckless and daring, he can protect you in some way or another. Or maybe it's the whole idea of the women trying to help the poor male death row killer, trying to convert his life, trying to save him. You know women love a challening man that they can fix, well here's your best victim!

First of all, make sure that instead of gravel, you have sand in the bottom of your tank.  They are nocturnal, do not give them more than two hours of light per day.  They like to eat bloodworms.  Usually you put some thawed worms in a turkey baster and put it right in front of their mouths.  If I remember correctly, they prefer to eat with their lights off.

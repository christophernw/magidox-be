Hello Ankita,. . Dholkla is quite simple to make if you use the ready mixes. They give instructions and is very easy. I prefer Gits mix. I would like to share my experiance. When my wife was expecting, she always wanted to have Khaman-Dhokla & our cook wasn't always available. I found that making Khaman-Dhokla was very easy if one uses the ready mix. I did so & could make wonderful Dhokla.. . I am sure that you don't need any help. Just follow what the manufacturer mentions on the pack.. . Kumar

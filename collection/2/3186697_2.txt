well my opinion  is that the rotor was over heated in the past it became brittle(tempered)due to over applying the breaks (breaking hard ) that it was just wore out and thin , most people take for granted there breaks will be there for them when they need them but sometimes they arent as you found out it is a good idea not to fly up to the stop sighn or light but to slow down before you get there so you dont strain your brake system... oh that blackish dust on your front wheels is the brake linings from over applying your brakes!

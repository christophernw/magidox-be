Wow, that's a tough one.  I guess I've never really considered it before.  But, I did a little research online.  It seems as though roads and houses are directly bonded to the earth through a foundation with such materials as cement or asphalt.  . . In comparison, a vehicle or a person is only attached through gravity.  Tires and (human) feet lack the adhesiveness necessary for a tight bond with the earth.  . . There is a great formula to find out if an object is "moveable" or not.. . Think . --------- *  it + for (object) - 2 seconds. about. . Hope this helps.

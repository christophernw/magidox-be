armystud has it right, I'm using the GI Bill now.  He didn't mention that you can use it for 36 months as a full time student, or 72 months as a part time student.  They also had a kicker in when I was in a few years ago where you sign up and put $100 more into the pot for 6 months, then your GI bill is worth around $6000 more when you get out.  Also, keep in mind you must be honorably discharged to use it.

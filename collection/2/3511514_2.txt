Hunting as in how? Killing them...?  That's bad. And wrong.  :[  They never did nothin' to you!. . Please... a real hunter would go out there hand-to-hand.  And since the shark DOES have an advantage, I guess you can use a knife.. . Hunting for sport is the most ridiculous thing ever ... right next to George Bush (Jr) being elected for president.. . Don't run with the stupidity.

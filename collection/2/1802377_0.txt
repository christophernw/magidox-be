When putting water in an aquarium, you don't want to use fresh water from the tap or a bottle.  You're supposed to let it sit out open for at least a day before you put fish in it.  That way, all the harmful chemicals in the water that might kill the fish will have time to evaporate out of the water.  That is what's meant by "aged" water.

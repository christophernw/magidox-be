I also vote that everyone should have to work behind a counter at least once in their life, and that should be at the busiest time of year.  They should have to start the day after Thanksgiving and work until at least February to be sure to have to deal with all the people returning gifts, also.  Oh, yes!  I think many people's eyes would be opened to the world of obnoxious customers!

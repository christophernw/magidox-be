A german girlfriend would not make any difference. Only if you are married to a WORKING german you can stay automaticly.. You have to apply for a residenspermit and a workpermit.. I don't want to scare you, but be aware of some hard times concerning running around, doing paperwork and finding a job.. Good Luck!

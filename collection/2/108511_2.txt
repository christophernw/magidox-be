WELL<IF YOUR ALLERGIST CAN"T FIND ANYTHING YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO(which is odd) then   it could be stress!!!!!!You would be amazed at what extreme stress can do to ones body.It can even cause you to experience episodes of anxiety attacks.I went through all of your same symptoms,I truly understand: I get allergy shots,i was on steroids,i am on anxiety meds,and estrogen for the hot flash crap.I went through it for a year!!!!Good luck to you!!!!!!!

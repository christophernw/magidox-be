People do not use God's Word to back up their points because it would be impossible. Too often their human thoughts are diametrically opposed to God's thoughts.. . (2 Timothy 4:3,4) For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own likings, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander into myths.

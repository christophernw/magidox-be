Advantage and Frontline each cost about $10 per month and work much better than anything else.  It would be worthwhile to get one of them for the first two months, even if you used other remedies later.  The reason for two months is that the flea life cycle is six weeks long and it will take two treatments to get rid of all generations.. . If not Advantage or Frontline, the next best things are flea powder and flea shampoo.  Cats hate both of them.. . Other treatments do not work.  I have tried things you can get in the grocery stores and Wal-Mart and I think they are a waste of money.  Flea collars have little benefit.. . A flea comb costs about $5.  Only get a good flea comb made entirely of metal because the others are worthless.  See a good pet store or your vet.  Have them show you how to use it.  To kill the fleas, crush them with your thumb nail against the comb, or drop them into soapy water or alcohol.. . Flea traps are nearly free.  Put one in every room.  To make one, suspend a night light about four inches above a shallow _white_ dish of soapy water.  Turn the light on all night long.  If you keep flea traps in each room and always use them, it will reduce your flea problem dramatically.. . And lastly, you can keep the cats inside.

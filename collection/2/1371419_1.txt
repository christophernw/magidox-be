Hey, Mona!. . I totally agree with you on a subject of love, romance, life.. . But, my question (Gujaljuta: "I need EU citizenship for a PhD scholarship. Marriage - is it the only way? How long does it take? Any idea?") was not about how to cheat a person, but how to obtain valid (legal) papers. Having said that, I guess it's obvious I didn't mean to get married and CLAIM that I was in love, but somehow to make it as a contract-marriage or something like that.... . Just imagine your country does not exist anymore and now you need tons of papers, visas, etc., plus 10 times more money in order to work/study in EU/UK. I have only one life and I thought it would be ok to make a contract, get married, have papers, divorce, and continue normal life.. . You can reply to: gujaljuta / jahoo.  :). . Cheers!. . p.s. Sorry RainbowDream, don't know the answer to your question. But thanks for giving me space here. :)

There must be more to the story than a 'breathing tube' as it is not possible to pass any tube past the back of the tongue - at least not if the person is conscious.  I assume that you mean your girlfriend needs to take breathing treatments where a person placed a tube between their lips and in a sense into the mouth.  If this is correct - squirt the medication into the resevoir - turn the nebulizer on - and breath in and out normally being careful not to hyperventilate.  A treatment requires 5 to 10 minutes.  Always report any increase in shortness of breath.

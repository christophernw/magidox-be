Good question...In God we trust is on all of our coins, One nation under God is in our pledge of allegiance, it was obviously our founding fathers intentions to have this nation be God oriented.  We do allow for religious freedom here, which I am grateful for, it is what makes America what it is, and since our nation was founded on God, those who can not deal with His name being used should find somewhere they are more comfortable, or learn to be tolerant. We don't stop other religions from practicing their faiths, or those who choose to not practice or not believe, but why should we have to assimilate to those who don't share the values on which this country was founded.

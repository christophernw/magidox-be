That's beacuse cameraphones can't create and store EXIF data in the photos unlike  digital cameras. Also, naming photos automatically by the date using phone software/hardware isn't too practical, and most people aren't going to use them anyway.. However, most of the current "imaging" phones,  (like the Sony Ericsson K750i, W800, W810, W900, Nokia 6630, 6680, N70, N90, Motorola V3x etc support the storage and embedding of EXIF data into the pictures.

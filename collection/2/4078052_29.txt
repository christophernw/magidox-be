In the days of very early Christianity, covens of witches (the Wiccan religion) coexisted very well with Christians. In fact, early Christians often took Wiccan traditions and incorporated them into early Christianity. In later Christianity, the Roman Catholic church was not pleased that more people were not turning to Christianity and decided to demonize the Wiccan religion. A coven of witches consisted of (and still consists of) 13 members...1 priestess or priest and 12 members. The Catholic church deemed the number 13 unlucky in order to frighten more people away from this nature-loving religion of Wicca. . . What's ironic is the "forgotten" books of the Bible...the Apocrypha...make many allusions to adopted Wiccan principles and practices in early Christianity...how many churches now include the Apocrypha!?

Bill Clinton - . . I had never voted and was not particularly interested in politics for that matter prior to Bush/Gore.  My beliefs for the most part were liberal.. . Having the opportunity to travel internationally, I was continually getting humiliated during the Clinton administration by the comments of citizens of other countries at the antics that he, his wife and party kept subjecting the country and its people to.  . . I was to the point that I regretted that inevitable point in a conversation when asked "where are you from"?  From that point forward, all anybody could talk about was the depths which we had allowed or system of government to sink to.. . If people think we are unpopular now, they don't realize its only with people who are not our true allies anyway or the extreme liberal portions of those countries who are our allies.  Previously, everyone on the planet ridiculed us because of the Clinton's.

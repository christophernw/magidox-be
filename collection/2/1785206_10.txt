You raise a very valid point... religion and spirituality isn't necessarily limited to one religion, one denomination, one way of thinking.  However since the vast majority of users of the English speaking areas of Yahoo would be Christian (a cultural and sociological reality, not a religous one), statistically there would be more Christians espousing Christian religious and spirituality points of view.  I'd welcome a discussion and presentation of other faith and spirituality traditions.

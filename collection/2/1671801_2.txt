It depends on what you mean by level. In terms of dollars, the company generated $1.6 billion in revenues from marketing services in their latest quarter (1Q06). This was 34% higher than the same period last year. On an annual basis, Yahoo reported $4.6 billion in marketing services revenues. . . As a comparison, Google, generated $2.2 billion in revenues from advertising in their latest quarter (1Q06) which was a 79% increase on the same period in 2005. In the full year of 2005, Google recorded $6.1 billion in revenues from advertising, up 93% from 2004.. . There are obviously other ways this can be measured - users, unigues, ad impressions etc but revenues generated is the clearest indication of value of its involvement in e-marketing.

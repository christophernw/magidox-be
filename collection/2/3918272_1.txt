You can blind bake your crust, other answers already gave you directions for this.. Another trick my grandma uses when she's baking pies (especially berry pies since they seem to produce even more juice than other fruits!) is to toss the berries in 1 or 2 tablespoons of cornstarch before adding them to the pie crust.  This way the juice turns into a nice thick saucy filling, rather than just liquid running all over the place.. *Fruit pie filling recipes should never contain any added liquid!!*

I assume you are dealing with a hot water tank rather than an instant-on hot water heater, and assuming there is no unusual pressure build-up in your hot water pipes.  The tank is pressurized, however, as the water heats  the hot water expands and this creates increased pressure within the tank.  As the water flows out of the tank, this pressure is released, thereby the presure in the tank goes down.  As hot water flows out of the tank, cold water flows in to replace it, and cooler water adds to reducing the pressure build-up.

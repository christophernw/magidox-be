To answer song no one's objection, ouija boards, and other forms of communication with spirits, may produce unintelligible nonsense even when people are using them without being blindfolded. There have been many authenticated cases of people communicating with "spirits" via ouija boards and receiving responses that none of the users could have known, and that are accurate, and then some of the responses make no sense at all. Something beyond normal communication is definitely at work here, though whether it is actually communication with the dead, or psychic communication with the living, has yet to be established..      I am a horror writer (among other genres) who hasn't sold anything yet. I know something about magic and the paranormal, through my research, and if you're going to use ouija, please never, ever do it by yourself. Somehow, nobody seems to know why, two people playing ouija seems to reduce the risk that a player will receive malign influences. Second of all, don't do it too often, nor for too long a session at one sitting. And if a hostile spirit manifests itself, stop immediately, no matter what. Don't carry on in the spirit of "scientific inquiry", or hoping that it'll tell you something valuable.

It depends on what might have triggered the headache.  Sometimes too much caffeine will do it, or if you regularly drink caffinated beverages and stop suddenly (withdrawal).  Muscle tension can cause them too.  Try squeezing the fleshy area between the thumb and index finger (not too hard) for 10 seconds and releasing for 10 seconds a few times.  It should activate the adrenal gland to release adrenaline which affects pain.

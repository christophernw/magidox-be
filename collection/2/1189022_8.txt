I would rather see my hard earned money pouring into Afghanistan/Pakistan to find Usama than in Iraq. I mean Usama is the mastermind of 9/11! So where does Iraq come into play on 9/11? Nowhere! This goes to proof positive that George Bush had his own agenda for lying to the American Gov't, and the American people about WMD'S. Usama is not in Iraq, nor has anyone proven that Iraq has ever had any confirmed business with AL-Qaeda. The mountains of Afghanistan are his home. He is very skilled at living and hiding in that terrain. Obviously so because we can't find him. People are certainly helping him. Back to 9/11. I really feel that the American public will never forget that fateful day, but the way that the investigations and the rebuilding of the towers, and the memorials has overshadowed the fact that all of those innocent people lost their lives. A memorial should have been complete by now, and the area should already be redeveloped, up, and running. It just goes to show what is priority in this country, and if we can't agree to memorialize these individuals, and get the process rolling for reconstruction, then they have let the terrorists win again because they are happy to hear that we are squabbling about things so trivial.

Because people were frightened and threatened by what he had to say.  His teaching undid the need for the structure and ritual of formal religion (funny how a religion can spring from such a teaching).  He taught that God was accessible by everyone and that no one was special in terms of this.  Those in positions of power did not like this message because it demonstrated the hypocrisy and hierarchy of the systems of religion and the social and political structures.  They wanted him to shut up because their livelihoods and power structures were under question, and so they killed him.  He taught that the thought system of this world is completely backwards and alien to the truth of the nature of real Creation.  People at that time were not prepared for such a message, and even today not much has changed.

Other than not drinking???  Just kidding... . It's important to drink plenty of water and stay hydrated.  Alcohol dehydrates you and the more dehydrated you are the worse the hangover will be.  So hydrate well before drinking and after!  . . It's also important to make sure you have eaten prior to drinking.  It's easier on your stomach and you'll be less likely to get an upset stomach.  You don't want to be paying homage to the toliet god!  . . I think it's also good not to pound them down too quickly.  Space it out a little bit or drink slower.. . Cheers!

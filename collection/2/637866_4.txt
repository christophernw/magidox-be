Birds are adapted in lots of ways to be able to fly. There are the wings and semi-hollow bones and egg laying mentioned above. The feathers help, although bats fly without feathers. Flighted birds also have a "keel" on their breast bone that the large flight muscles attach to (check out a chicken breast sometime - those are flight muscles and chickens don't even fly much). They also have special respiratory systems, etc.. . Since we have none of those things, we'll just have to stick to airplanes.  ;)

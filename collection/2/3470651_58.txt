You're building up static electricity either positive (+) or negative (-) charge, you're discharging it once you have touched a lower static charge object, such as cars or grounded objects such as aluminum doors(metals are connected to concrete, directly to earth), as a result of both bodies to come into potential equilibrium. These static voltages can reach 30,000 volts and up. The one you felt is only 4,000 to 7,000 volts static electricity.. . Building of static charge originates from walking, rubbing, (all events which has friction), and also on a high level of humidity.. . If you will discharge yourself, you're car will also cause a static discharge to you and/or vice versa.. . You can minimize this in an expensive way, retrofitting your car with ground connection and you, or, buy a leather gloves, which you will use always when you touch anthing or any object, especially when it is metal.

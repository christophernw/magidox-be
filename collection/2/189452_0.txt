treat using the products as directed and be sure to pic out the nits by hand, then retreat a week later again get any nits you missed. once you start treatments to help keep from reinfesting use tea tree oil shampoo daily. Make sure you  dry or freeze all stuffed items or dolls(yes barbie too). do these things at a very high temp for at least and hour or lezve them out over night in a heavy frost, do it a couple times to be safe. Good luck, I hated dealing with it but you can get rid of it, make sure its not coming from a griends poorly treated home as well so you can limit your child being there,

To me "Sam (Betty) Jones" is a bit confusing, it makes it look like Sam was once known as Betty (erm.. before the operation..). . . The "Sam & Betty Jones" version is better. However, it makes Sam and Betty look like brother and sister.. . You might consider something like:. . Mother of:. Sam Jones (Son) & Betty Jones (Daughter in law). . or.  . Mother of:. Sam Jones (Son). Betty Jones (Daughter in law)

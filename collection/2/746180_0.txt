You only eat the red pips, it's OK to swallow the seeds inside.  Don't eat the skin, the white pithy part or the core.. I usually just buy pomogranite juice but on the sales display a week ago I saw instructions on how to eat so I bought a couple, this does work:. Cut the pomogranite in half, in a bowl of water pull the sections apart and separate the red pips from the white pith with your fingers.  Any seeds that escape into the bowl of water you can strain out and add to your bowl of seeds.  . This actually worked pretty well.  Doing it in the bowl of water kept me from squirting pom juice everywhere.   Pom juice does stain pretty badly, and getting the juice on your fingers will stain them (my finger tips were black for three days after this) so next time I'll wear latex gloves when I break up a pom.. Best wishes!

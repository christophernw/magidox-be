Why not, Is there any bigger and more regular than God that people believe in? . I found God from his order in some natural matters like four seasons they always come with definite time and their turn never change.. 1-Fall . 2-Summer. 3-Spring. 4-Winter. ????. Always they follow each other {spring summer fall winter}. . Second reason in my opinion is that all day start and finished in definite time. Every body may over slept but have you ever see that Sun over slept and hasn't rose?. . and many other reasons that prove our wise smart God .

While yes, your response was rude, I'm sorry, but I'm not about to walk up to a totally random stranger and start asking them personal questions about their life.  I'm sorry, but honestly, it's none of their business.. . Especially since, where I live, you only walk up to strangers for two reasons - 1) to buy drugs or 2) to shoot them.

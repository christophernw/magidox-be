Let start by making sure we are using the word miracle correctly: A miracle is "an event that appears inexplicable by the laws of nature and so is held to be supernatural in origin or an act of God".. . To say some survives something is not a miracle. For in an accident, it maybe a miracle that someone survived, but it is not a miracle if it isl explained. Most the statements you hear about miracles are not miracles.. . For miracles to happen, there is no reason for them. You can see this in medical cases when someone has a illness and they are cured. Lourdes is an excellent example of 4 (maybe 5) cases. Which leads you to believe miracle are rare.. . As a Christian, I believe the bible is the word of God as spoken by the prophets. In the four accounts of Jesus' life, how many miracles are there? Try counting them. And like Lourdes, you will not find many.. . You now have the standard English definitions and two places where miracles are documented. You can believe what you want regarding them, but don't confuse a gift from God with an act of man.

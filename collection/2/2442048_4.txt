Microbiology is the study of Micro - organisms - their functions, life, growth, physical and chemical natures etc.. Microbiology has a lot of future career options.. U will be Microbiologist if u undertake this field. Though there are some career option after doing your undergraduate I strongly advise you to take a postgraduate course in the same or other related fields as Biotechnology. As u know biotech is an up coming field. But the career options are not good if you're in a developing country.

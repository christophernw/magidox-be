I believe that you mean hemodialysis. It's an artificial method of blood purification. It's a painful process by which blood is extracted and processed by a machine in order to filter out waste products that would normally be removed by the kidneys. It is usually used on patients suffering from kidney failure and whom are in line for a transplant.

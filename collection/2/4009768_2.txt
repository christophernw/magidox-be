The salts, and there are a lot more than sodium chloride, in sea water come from the erosion of rocks by rivers and streams on land.  The oceans have no outlet so the salts accumulate.  The oceans pick up a lot of fresh water from rain and from rivers that feed into them.  But, the oceans lose a lot of water through evaporation.  Also there are chemical reactions at the bottom of the oceans that take salt out.  . . I think that the salts were and are carried in by rivers.  Lakes with no outlets like the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea become very salty, much more salty that the oceans.  These lakes pick up mineral salts albeit in small quantities from the streams or rivers that flow into them and then it is concentrated through evaporation.  . . The reason that the oceans are no more salty than they are is because of chemical reactions at the bottom of the oceans.  . . Glaciers don't do this they tend to put fresh water into the oceans.

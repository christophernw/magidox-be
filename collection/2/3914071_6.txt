square the bore size of your engine then multiply it by the stroke, then the number of cylinders as well as by Pi (as in pi in circles, the one you use to find the area.) then you divide it by 4. . . The bore is the size of the hole of the cylinder in the block. I belive its just the diameter of the hole.. . The stroke is how deep your cylinder goes when it moves.. . . Usually, this could come out in cc or in litres. if you want to convert it in cubic inches then multiply it by 61.02374

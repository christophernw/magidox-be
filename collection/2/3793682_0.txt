indian ness means the nature of an indian and to behave like an indian. please don't ask these types of questions because u can't claim any country wrong or right in front of everybody it makes the country to go towards wrong path. today the people of india themselves think that india is useless this is wrong and i don't think that india is useless. only the people of india who say like this are useless. I LOVE MY COUNTRY

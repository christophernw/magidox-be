THAT'S LIFE. You can never learn when you can't find life so hard. Life is learning and a continous process of learning. You have to deal evrything so that you can survive. Life is not hard as you can imagine,what is hard is when you did not exist at all. Just be grateful everyday for the blessings that you received, it's one way to appreciate life.The more you have friends the more things you can appreciate from life.

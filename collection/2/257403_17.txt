i personally would go for the chicken.. i saw my son cooking frog legs one time and they were trying to jump out of the pan.. this is really the truth.. so i do not think i want to eat any...the only reason i guess they would eat it is because they do not eat it very often .. and maybe to say they did...i know i never tried it though

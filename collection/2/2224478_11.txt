Well, first of all, I believe in God wholeheartedly.  Here's why.  Atheists are entitled to their opinion, but I don't see how it's possible for stars to combust or whatever their theory is, and create a new planet (well that part alone is possible) but with an entirely new life form with animals and this and that, that his its own laws of nature and makeup.  . . Then on to why I believe in God.  I'm a religious Jew, so my opinions may not be that of the majority of people, but you asked, so I'll answer.  First of all, I'm not a super religious Hasidic Jew who is totally ignorant of outside world.  I'm a very aware and educated person.  So we've already established why I believe God created the world.  Now why I believe that He's still here, watching over it.  Every day is ordinary, right?  You don't have these crazy awesome miracles that you here about in The Five Books of Moses.  It's all normal, humanely possible.  But think of all the little things that could go wrong, you feel almost must go wrong, and will ruin everything, but they don't. That, in my opinion, shows the hand of God in everything we do.

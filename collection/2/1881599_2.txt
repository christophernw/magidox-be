The self-replicating genetic structures of cells, formed from DNA and protein, found in the cell nucleus. Each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of the genes that form our hereditary blueprint. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes (each parent contributes one chromosome in each pair), containing a total of 50,000 to 100,000 genes from each parent.. In short, the self-replicating genetic structure of cells containing the cellular DNA. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

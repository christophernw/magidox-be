The early church had women in strong roles, which was very progressive.  Later - a few hundred years later - that strong role was diminished by male dominated culture.  So, no.  Jesus having a female apostle wouldn't have probably made much difference.  Unless he said stuff like, "Blessed are the chicks for they are entitled to 70% of male salry, and 120% of the chores" I doubt it would have went over.

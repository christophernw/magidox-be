While pain is an indicator of a problem, the absense of pain doesn't necessarily mean everything is OK.  The tooth had likely rotted down to the nerve, and leaving it there could have caused an abscess (pocket of infection).  That abscess could easily demolish the nerve or spread to other teeth.  Without removing that tooth, there was a significant possibility you could have lost ALL your teeth.. . Put in that perspective, having one tooth pulled doesn't seem so bad, hm?

he insists to push it open, scooting in front of her and pushing it with one arm while he sees her go through. Its really dumb though because no matter who you are, it makes a woman feel like your a professional and she, just a helpless 'woman;'. Personally i feel that you should open doors and just hold them for people without the fake smiles and oh thank yous. Just hold it open like you knew someone was going to go through and like it was your job. Why not just put door jambs in these stupid business doors during buisness hours so nobody would go through this inconvenience. Matter of fact just take off all the doors to businesses and never worry about the problem again.

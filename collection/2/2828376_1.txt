They didn't take it from Satanism.  Yes, it is a coincidence. The pentagram used as a religious symbol is actually fairly new to Paganism, Satanism, etc.  It was, however, once used in the Christian Religion.  But the Eastern Star didn't take it from anyone.  It is how the seats are set up during their meetings.  (I was once in the Eastern Star).  But this is like saying Texas' symbol, the Lone Star, took it from Paganism when they didn't.  (BTW, the symbol for Israel is also a lone star *wink*).  The image of the inverted Pentagram wasn't given such a bad image till Christianity said it had a bad image.  In some sects of Paganism, it symbolizes something other than "evil", but more about the state of being human.

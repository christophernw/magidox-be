In 99% of the churches: nothing, except perhaps getting wet, and  some are more generous with the water than others. Some cheapskate churches only sprinkle, while others dunk. Some in tanks, some in rivers, some in lakes (not a good idea here in Florida-the gators love fat, crunchy Christians). The whole thing is a sham, a show, a public demonstration of their ability to gain new converts into their church; to boost their membership rolls  and  to fatten the treasury of their carnal empire. What it supposed to be as defined by Scripture in Romans 6  is an identification with Christ into His death. But who wants to die? Everyone wants only the new life as a Christian, the joy, the happiness, the new family of friends and the ability to sin freely with grace as their constant free pass from the consequences.  Only once you  understand and agree to your co-death with Christ to the world, to sin and to self are you a candidate to be buried into the waters of  Christian baptism.  Upon arising from the grave you inherit the new resurrected life that is in Christ, which will provide you with the power to live a life of  a disciple of Messiah, in holiness, victory and union with Him.  Most people refuse to die and thus we have the apostate church dunking everyone they can grab to baptize them  into their  polluted waters of deception.  But business is good, the water wet and the coffers full. What more could they possible want? Certainly not the Christ of the New Testament who is now in heaven watching and waiting till the day He brings His wrath upon   them. And that day is soon.

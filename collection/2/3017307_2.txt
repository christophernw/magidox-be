All of your points are exactly correct, hence the reason I was not camping out like those idiots. Lol. Wii is gonna be cool too - probably with less glitches than the PS3 at launch, and I'm assuming that everyone will be to busy with their PS3's to crowd up for the Wii.  At any rate, I'll get my PS3 probably spring of next year, when all the bugs are worked out and From Software launches Armored Core 4.

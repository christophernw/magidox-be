Frankly it is a matter of time.  There is far too much involved in running a government, much less three, to do it part time.  We would have to run our local governments, state governments and our national government.. . Aside from the time issue, how could you have a meaningful debate with 100,000,000 people involved?. . The comment about secrecy and national security is a good point as well.

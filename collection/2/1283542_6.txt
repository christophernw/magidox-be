Sounds like your coworker is very self centered, and the hypochondria probably stems from the fact that she is trying to get people to notice her.  I don't think hopochondria and personality disorders necessarily go hand in hand, and in this case she probably just exaggerates her illnesses and injuries for attention.  Just ignore her and maybe she'll get the hint.

If you have fatty liver, it can be from drinking heavily or drinking massive amounts of soda.  Most soda uses high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar, this leads to fatty buildup in the liver. Children are more prone to this these days because the soda companies switched from regular fructose to high fructose corn syrup.  If you suspect you have fatty liver, the non alcoholic type NASH or the alchoholic kind, you should have your liver enzymes checked and have your liver looked at on a sonogram.

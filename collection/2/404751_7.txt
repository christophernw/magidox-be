It takes mass quantities of salt to make these items and guess what?  we get the brunt of that to consume!  Not good for the body at all!  Check all the sodium grams in your packaging on the side, if its in the 23 milligram range your aching for high blood pressure and all sorts of problems in life later on down the road if your not careful.  We are so unaware of the products we consume anymore.  I'm also guilty.  Ive started to become aware after the age of 40 and not having any health insurance, i had to start to figuring this out or have medical bills and bad health as a result of it.  Be more aware of the foods you consume so you know why all these funky disease's are cropping up in people now, its from all the years of eating processed food and now we as a whole race of people are paying for it. This is also why insurance is so high, business is booming!  The foods we eat are killing us literally.

What i think is funny is that a large portion of the people who claim Cherokee, claim that their great grandmother was a Cherokee princess. Okay, if your Cherokee and telling the truth, FINE, BUT there was no such thing as royalty in the indigenous nations back in the day...yes there were chiefs...but the false label of "_____ Princess" actually came from when the beautiful young indigenous females that were shipped to "the old world" and forced to slavery within royal family homes...BUT...anybody who did not hold a royal title was not allowed into these homes, so these poor frightened girls were given the titles of "princess" so they could legally enter these estates to slave away;they were usually discarded after age overcame their ability to slave...so only the stories were returned, never the "princesses"...little off the subject, but i wanted to share that fun fact ;)

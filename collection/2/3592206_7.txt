is not as simple as it may look, this is a very subjective question.. . What I think, is that whenever you detect some danger, you may be uncomfortable being observed by somebody, it do not need to be the same sex of yours.. . So if you have a very closed mind education, you may detect danger on a same sex person who may be thinking on you as a sex toy, or as a friend or as anything.

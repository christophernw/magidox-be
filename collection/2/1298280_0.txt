This is related to what has been termed, by Chalmers 'the hard problem' of consciousness. When someone is presented with the colour blue their brain activity can be monitored to a certain degree and there is a fair amount of knowledge of 'what goes on' in the brain in response to the colour blue.. . But precisely how the brain gives rise to the inner conscious phenomena (or 'qualia' as it is sometimes called) of the perception of the colour blue, is a complete and utter mystery. Chalmers suggests that consciousness may be an irreducible feature of the universe and we will never understand it, other scientists reckon it is too early to come to that conclusion.

Well i have 3 of them that dont make me racist now does it ?? Ok maybe people have them cause they are from the south, some may use it as racist but what does that solve?? Nothing. Yeh som euse it as red neck but thas not the case, people ought to look up what it really means and not use it for racisim or any click that they have going on . Honestly. It means the south is not dead  from the civil war  we are still here  and gonna be here for as long as  the good man up stairs will let us be here..

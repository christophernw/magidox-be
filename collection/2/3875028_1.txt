Pasta would be a very poor choice for a cat.  I would judge you are in Australia as kangaroo is used in pet food there and not in the US.  So I don't know if the smell of kangaroo is worse than any other cat food.  Meat is always the choice in food for a cat and if it is cooked meat from commercial food it will have the taurine that she must have for her health.. . I believe Dr. Robert Lonsdale of Australia is head of your national veterinary association and a strong proponent of raw diets for cats and dogs.  That's something you can look into by putting in an internet search for BARF (biologically appropriate raw food).  I make a raw diet (with a supplement powder) for my cats.  I am not a vegetarian and many who are "stomach" the cat food and raw meat for the sake of their cats.  No grain or grain product, such as pasta, can possibly meet the nutritional needs of a cat.

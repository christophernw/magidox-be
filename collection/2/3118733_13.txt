On top of getting good grades and doing chores, my best technique was giving my parents a guilt trip about what they were spending on themselves. Of course this has to be done wisely to make sure that they can't spin it on you. By making them feel guilty about what they bought themselves then u add in all the good stuff you did and you should have a new game in no time. Note: This works best after a week of good work and right after your parents buy something cool for themselves.

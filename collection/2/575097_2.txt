These folks have covered what to do if the drum is frozen on with rust, but there may be another problem. The drums may be worn down so there is a groove the shoes are riding in now. This makes the diameter of the outside of the shoes bigger than the diameter of the drum edge. You can pound all you want, but if this is the case, you won't pass that smaller diameter over a larger one.. . There is a slot in the back of the brake housing. It should have a rubber plug on it. Remove it and you will see an adjustment ring with teeth on it.. . You will have to turn this ring to bring the shoes closer together. I'm not sure which way to turn the ring, but you'll find out. It should turn easier when you are moving them close together.

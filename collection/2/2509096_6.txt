All religions are basically the same.... . They are designed to keep you in line to what they want you to think and if you question it you are generally told not to question it or that if you question it you will go to hell and if you leave that religion you will go to hell and that all other religions are wrong.. Just beleive what you want to beleive and dont get boxed into a religion.. FIGHT BRAIN CONTROL!

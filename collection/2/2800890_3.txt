A positive number divided by 0 is not infinity.. It's positive and negative infinity. 1/1 =1. 1/0.1 =10. 1/0.0001 = 10000. . but also. 1/-1 =-1. 1/-0.01 =-10. 1/-0.0001 = -10000. . In the function 1/x, the limit as x approaches 0 from the positive side, it becomes positive infinity.. . The limit as x approaches 0 from the negative side, it becomes negative infinity.. . 0/0 is undefined because it can be any number from negative infinity to positive infinity. Take 2 functions y =a*x and y=1x. Both of these function will be 0 when x =0. but a*x/x will be a when x =0

Depending on how many matts and how severe they are, you may want to take her to a professional groomer. Chances are they might be too close to her skin, making any attempt to remove them very painful. Also, to avoid matts, you should buy a nice grooming brush and figure, the longer the fur the more you need to brush her daily, and i mean more than once a day. Good luck!

A condom is also called a prophylactic. It is a vinyl or rubber sheath that goes over the penis to prevent pregnancy. It is rolled up, & you unroll it over & down your penis shaft before sexual intercourse. It decreases male sensitivity, so if you have a problem with premature ejaculation, a rubber or condom can help.

Cats should be brought in at night they are natural preditors killing birds and other wild life it is law in my country to have them in at night give it somewhere comfortable to sleep and in house cat play centres covered with a cheap carpet so they can claw and climb if they want so as to not ruin your furniture.They are not that expensive and a kitty litter tray just in case but older cats can hold on kittens cant ..If it is male there is no other way .

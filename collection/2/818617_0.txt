Doing crunches tightens the muscles in the stomach, but no matter how tight those muscles are, if there is a layer of "fat" over it (and I'm not saying your fat, we all have it...) then your stomach won't look "tight." So the best thing to do is cut down on carbs and fried foods, combined with crunches. You really don't have to do thousands of crunches to get a great stomach - just do crunches and cut down on fattening foods, fried foods, and unfortunately (the hardest for me) beer...

Duraglit, which is actually brass polish, is used throughout the trade to remove sticker prices from delicate china, glass and everyday objects. I do not see why is should not work on  a windscreen. I fear razor blades will scratch the glass, and I am afraid water only works on glues that were water based in the first place. If they were chemical glues, you could also try nail varnish remover (acetone) which is recommended on methylene based glues, or Methylene chloride, but don't spill it on a plastic dashboard  or paintwork as it will leave marks.

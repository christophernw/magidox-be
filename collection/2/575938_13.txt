I think many people like to answer mindless questions or ask them because they are easy ,they don't require allot of thinking and they allow you to occupy your time without overexerting your brain(if you have one), or maybe people have worked hard all day and don't want to expend too much mind power.Example: I asked a totally vapid question and got 41 replies. Some of my more serious questions(but still maybe not up to your standards!) got3 or 4 replies!Ask something truly profound and I will try to answer it but not tonight, I'm going to bed now!

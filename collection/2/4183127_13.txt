It's not a question of being prudish, it's a question of having a conscious and morals. Being loose and and promiscuous shows a great lack of morals and low self esteem. We should treat are bodies with respect and then others will respect us. Sex is not a game as some people use it for. The majority of people don't know the difference between love and lust, they need to take a deep look at why they are so promiscuous and then they would find the answer as to why some people are prudish, they have high self esteem and great love of themselves. It would n't hurt for more people to be prudish and stop giving in to lust, might just make the world a better place to live in, people might just start caring about each other once again and stop just discarding each other like trash after they have got what they want and used them up. Think about it!!

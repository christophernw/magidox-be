Dialects are regional variations of a language which include words in substitution for other words which those from outside the region may not be familiar with.. For instance in RP english one would say - What is that?. and in the regional Aberdeen dialect it would be - Fits that?. Colloquialisms are 'slang' terminology or abbreviated words which increasingly find their way into the dictionary and become standard.

my son was home schooled for awhile i feel he learned more from that because it was one on one studies and being he was my first child you sometimes fear the impossible and thats me i was afraid of him getting hurt by children older than him or getting kidnapped i know that sounds crazy but it happens i've gotten over that for the most part. home schooling gave my son a great experience to learning and to want to learn he does go to public school now he's in the forth grade w/a sixth grade level.

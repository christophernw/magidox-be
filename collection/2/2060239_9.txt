Whole lotta dumb assses answering your question.  It's not yeast and it's not red.  It's due to presence of dark roasted malted barley, often referred to as chocolate malt.  The malt is roasted in an oven (like coffee beans) until it is almost burnt, giving it a very dark brown / black color, and a flavor  vaguely reminiscent of chocolate.  Added to beers (stouts and porters) it gives them the characteristic black color.

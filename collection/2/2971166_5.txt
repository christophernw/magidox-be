My understanding is that the term originates from the Native American (Indian) custom of never accepting a gift without giving something in return. Thus an 'Indian Giver' would give you something but expect another gift back from you. Naturally the gift you got back had to be more valuable than the one you gave so an Indian Giver described someone who took more than he gave.

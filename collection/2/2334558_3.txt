You know the guy next door?  He is the counselor at the local high school and has a spotless reputation.  But, you know him.  You've heard his lousy jokes, know how he really feels about equal rights, and have listened impatiently while he talks about the slower kids at the high school.  You have also seen him cheat at cards and know that his wife is having a lousy life.  You see, the more you know someone, the more likely you are to develop unkind thoughts towards them or mistrust them or doubt their abilities.  All the while, the local school board is honoring him with their Citizen of the Year Award.  . . You just know the guy too well.  You don't trust him.

oil companies aren't  always playing the game right. see the gas stations buy their gas at a set price, but that same gas they bought, a day ago they will raise the price up more, even tho they just bought it at this other price. they do it to make more profit on us, some gas stations do it some dont, so thats why you saw two gas stations with different prices.

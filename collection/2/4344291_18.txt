My opinion is two reasons. I do believe that some people are born gay. I think that something happens during the development of a child just like some are transgendered or have genetic problems. People act like all of a sudden there are all kinds of gay people. There has been evidence from centuries of people being gay. Back then if was looked down upon like some people look down upon it in today's time because they are shallow or are afraid of something they don't understand. I also believe that a person can become gay if they were sexually of mentally abused and something inside their head makes them feeling safer if they are with the same sex because of a traumatic event that happened to them at some point in their life from the opposite sex.

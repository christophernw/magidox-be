I answer questions truthfully and I know that even if I get your 10 points that I can not trade it for anything. I won't get any air miles and I won't get to go to planet Yahoo or stay in a fice star hotel. If I could go somewhere I would take my best friend. But right now I am just answering questions to get to level 5 I only have 172 after answering your question.

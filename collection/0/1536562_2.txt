i would believe that there shouldn't be a need to neutralise the solution first and i guess i would be better to use a solution of ferrous sulphate. i think this allow to reaction to proceed better. cos maybe if u use the solid salt directly the gold may coat onto the salt and thus reducing yield. i think there is really no fixed protocol but u might be able to find some somewhere but everything can be modified to suit ur needs

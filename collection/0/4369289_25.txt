It's a hard blessing of God that man is mortal. . With our mortality also comes an end to our sin nature.. This way, sin will not have permanent reign on the Earth. . It may be hard to swallow, but it is God's provision for His children, so that they have a time limit for accepting His Son as Savior and living eternally with Him in heaven.

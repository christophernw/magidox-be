High School is so much fun!!!!! the best advice is GET INVOLVED with ASB and SPorts! that will help it go by fast! because it is going to feel like it is going by slow. just have fun! but stay focused on your school work! because you dont wanna be alot of credits behind! and i suggest u go to summer school at least two summers so Senior year you can take less classes! trust me its worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good luck playa! oh and Girls! there a waste of time!!!!! just have fun! thats what college is for! ;)

You are used to taking in sugar and carbs for energy, the only problem is the energy you get from sugar doesn't last so you have to keep eating them through out the day.  If you keep eating like this you could end up with diabetes, carbs are the leading cause now because of the sugar and glucose they produce.. . If you can, and I know it's hard cause I went through this with a few people, try to cut back and eat more protein.  Protein fuels the body longer than carbs do and no risk of diabetes!

People who feel the need to think - because they have a problem - resort to stimulants to stimulate the brain. Hence stimulants can become very addictive. If you're worried, having trouble concentrating, nervous or even depressed - you may turn to a stimulant like coffee or nicotine and it may appear to help. But if your thinking isn't solving the problem - you go around and around in circles and become more depressed and more anxious. I've hardly ever drank coffee; but was extremely addicted to cigarettes and I'm much better off without them. Both my health, sense of well being, sense of taste and my finances are all much better. Giving up alcohol didn't have such a beneficial effect - I still fancy a drink - but I think it's good in the long term not to drink and I don't have to worry about drinking and driving - I'm always sober....

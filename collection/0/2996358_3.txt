(Random Jotting). . **Effect on Society Today**. We are still experiencing the effect of slavery to this day.  We still havent had a black president. We have affirmative action. We have black people being hired with no contest, though another worker may be more qualified for the position, just because the company is presured to display diversity. That is unfair to both the white worker and the black worker. No one wants a job based on something like their race. No body wants to lose a job based on their race. . . It is also evident in the always present discussion over reparations(sp?). We still have people who don't believe black people are equal to white people. We have white people who are sometimes made to feel as though they should take the blame as though they were somehow involved in this widespread practice. We still have black people who are likely haunted by the idea of how their ancestors were treated. We have reversed prejudice, in that certain black-only clubs or affiliations are accepted but a white-only club would surely spur an uprising, and be viewed as totally unacceptable. We still have division of North and South and discrimination based on such. The types of business and industries still retain the sharp contrast resulting from the time of slavery. We have a crisis like Katrina where the immediate accusations are that the victims were neglected because they were black.  The sad thing is that Im not sure that can be totally ruled out. There are racially based murders and beatings constantly.  . . **Effect on society in the past**. I think that slavery contributed greatly to the separation of social classes. Maybe we still see some residual effects today in Socio Economic Classes.

Planets are assumed to sweep their orbital zones of space.  The sun collects a large part of the debris that the planets don't.  We have generalized collections of asteriods in "camps" that concentrate slightly ahead and slightly behind the planets in the area between those orbital sweep zones.  You might look up langrange points to get an idea of how that works.  There are still lots of asteroids, meteoroids, and comets swinging through the solar system.  But they are pretty small pieces of mass in relation to the enormous distances they travel through.  Take a look at the moon, pocked with craters, it also has snagged a large number of rocks that would have hit the earth if the moon were not there.  Now consider the time scales that are estimated for the solar system--if the sun if 4 billion years old, that is a lot of time for things to settle down.  Our short history is but a tiny blip in that scale.  In time, it will happen.  Our geologic history is chock-full of examples where it happened, and they didn't appear to be a three-times a day affair.  Patience, when it happens it be too soon, trust me.

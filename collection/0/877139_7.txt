Yes, yes, you could, or course, go by the dictionary definitions, and let letters and words make the answer. Still, since we are talking about philosophy, it might be necessary to go deeper into the topic. As far as I comprehend it, a paradox is something that neither science nor philosophy has managed to sufficiently explain. The answer may lie in religion and belief, but many think such resources are not trustworthy. A contradiction, on the other hand, is a simple disagreement. We might have theories about the topic from sources that tell us this and that, and since  the correct answer in science is not always determined by a vote of majority, we have before us a number of (or just two) different theories or ideologies. Then it is a biased decision when we are asked the question.... I hope you can comprehend... have a nice day.

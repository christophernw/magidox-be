Nobody said it would be easy! :). . I take 12 credits and have 2 part time jobs and a wife who likes to see me on occasion.. . I also have a 3.76 GPA. . It can be done, just prioritize your time and realize that since it will be worth it in the ends a (unfortunately) social life and free time is sacrificed for a few years. . . You MUST enjoy what you do, school and work. I love my job and I enjoy learning, I believe that is why I am able to do it.

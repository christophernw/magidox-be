Maybe you mean the "secret documents" relating to Jesus's supposed geneaology which are the main focus of "The da Vinci Code."  These documents were fakes, put into a French public library by the Priory of Sion, an organization which claimed to be hundreds/thousands of years old.  The documents were fakes, the organization was not old.. . This whole thing was debunked more than 20 years ago in France.

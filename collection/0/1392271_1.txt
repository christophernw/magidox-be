If you want to copyright an idea, just write it all down, put a copy of it into an envelope and mail it to yourself via registered mail.  When you receive it, never open it.  Put it in a safe deposit box.  This will prove that the contents are in fact yours and you'll be able to provide it at court.. . However, this is not the same as a patent for an invention.  You need high priced lawyers to get one of those.

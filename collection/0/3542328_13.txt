When I was badly stung, the lifeguard put meat tenderizer on the sting.. . Although there are different types of jellyfish. I was severely stung by a Man-of-War while swimming in the ocean. I don't know if they all sting in a similar manner, but with a man-of-war, they look almost like a floating blue bubble, but underneath they have very long tentacles. When they sting bad, they usually wrap their long tentacles around whatever it is they are stinging. For example when I was stung, I initially just felt the tentacles brush my leg, but then it wrapped its tentacles practically from my thigh to my ankle and they stick to you and sting EXTREMELY bad. And like I said in my case, the lifeguard who helped me put meat tenderizer on it and I was told to take something for the pain and to help me sleep at night, like Tylenol PM or something similar.

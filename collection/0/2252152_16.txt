I learned the definition of a new word last year: co-dependent. It doesn't mean anyone is a bad person or needy. It just means that as humans we have a tendency to let our emotions get so wrapped up in how someone else thinks of us that we forget we are beautiful children of God who are independent and creative. Sometimes the pain we feel goes on for months. That is because as humans we are capable of remembering many things at the same time. Pain may be described as the persistence of memory and our own spiritual sensitivity. Work on making new memories with new people. If you pray for this ex-boyfriend to be strong enough to let go of you, that might have an interesting effect as well. He may need an anger management class in addition to that.

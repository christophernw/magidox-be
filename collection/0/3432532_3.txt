depends if u've had a c-section or a normal childbirth. with c-section, the abdominal muscles that were hit by the incision are considered to be "dead" already. no amount of exercise will take effect. otherwise for normal childbirth..pilates is a good way to get rid of pregnancy belly..i've tried it..

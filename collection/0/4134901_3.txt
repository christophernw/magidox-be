I say it more like the second one.  . . It varies with accent though.  . . The second one is usually [in England] associated with the 'posh'er section of society.  Many people in this city [in Scotland], who aren't 'posh' but actually the opposite of what 'posh' is typically perceived to be, pronounce it more like the first one though.. . So yeah - highly variable with accent!. x

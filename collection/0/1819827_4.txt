As long as there are special interests and no serious lobbying reform, it's never going to matter.  Everyone's ideas can be bought or sold at a $1000/person political fundraiser for any party...including the smaller ones like the Greens and the Working Families parties.  It's actually pretty sad.  As long as the money is there, anyone would compromise their integrity.

Chickens loose feathers for 3 reasons 1 in the spring they molt loose some of their feathers for the summer months. 2 they could be in a fight with another chicken or if you have a rooster, this is more likely the reason, the roaster becomes very aggressive and sometimes like to show them who is the boss. 3, mites if you notice that they are scratching themselves, then this is likely the reason. You can get a dusting powder for mites a feed ware house where you likely buy you chicken feed..................good luck

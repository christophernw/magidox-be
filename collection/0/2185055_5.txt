One answer: some of their leaders tend to enrich themselves, and controll the population's consent by "throwing the stick" (braging about hatred, israel and other) in order to make people NOT think about their more important problems such as unemployment poverty or famine. That technique is very old, but still effective everywhere. For example: just as you see rioting in islamic countries, you do NOT see them in the US concerning oil companies who are purposly keeping prices high.   . . Second Answer. There are some societies which do not really mind cars or infrastructure. It does not mean that they cannot achieve the western standards, they simply prefer it that way.. The fact is that modern infrastructure (cars+roads+tv+internet+electricity) worked its way through after industrial revolution (after a century and a half). Imagine Europe or US before that.. . The bottom line is, you cannot expect people from different social realities to conform to one standard. Not untill there is equal access to that standard and people accept it.

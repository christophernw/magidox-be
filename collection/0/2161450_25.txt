sry to break it to u little timmy, but u cant especially if u only 11. nobody's gonna listen to an 11 yr old, im suprised i actually listened to u for the past 2 minutes. but if u wanna TRY, u can start by NOT sayin "ok umm, ok." cuz people wanna listen to sumbody ELOQUENT, not sumone who sounds like theyre 11. act older than u really are. second, dont threaten ur mother. u better respect her cuz she brought u into this world n by sayin "i'll punch u in the face" ur not makin things better. if i was her, i woulda beat ur lil butt. next time, say sumthin like, "dont say that mom, thats really insulting to jews." third of all, shut up.

Others have done well describing blasphemy as: speaking against God (either His character or works), and/or acting in a way that contradicts God's character while claiming to represent God.. To answer the other half of your question, people often refer to any belief that they disagree with as blasphemy, but just because something is called blasphemy does not make it so.. Jesus was called a blasphemer by the religious 'authorities' of the time, yet He was not.. As for religious beliefs that are not true, heresy is a better word to use than blasphemy, even though heresies are blasphemous. So, while it is not totally inappropriate to use the term 'blasphemy', it is not the best choice of words possible in most situations.. People often use words that they do not know the precise meanings of, so they are often misused, especially in regards to spiritual/religious teminology.

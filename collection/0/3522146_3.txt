It would be the same thing as the police doing a sting and remember it was the police who reached out to the group that were trying to keep the predators off the street in the first place.  Remember the Chief in the beginning said they sought the help, and being that the police feel they are untouchable in a sense, and they believe they have a case, they don't need signed releases from the predators.  Also, the police had the evidence from the chat room conversations, and some of the predators had admitted why they had come to the house.  For the ones who tried to escape, being that it was a sting, they couldn't lie their way out.

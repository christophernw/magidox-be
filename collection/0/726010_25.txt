Throughout history there has always been a problem about what to call the place where one performs the act of defecation. As soon as a word for it caught on, another squeamish section of the population would find the reference distasteful & would come up with a euphemism. Britons & Americans just happen to be out of sync with their euphemism but actually 'toilet', related to the French 'toilette' is also a euphemism. Is 'potty' or 'loo' inherently more correct than 'john'? And furthermore, most bathrooms in American homes also contain a toilet, commode, throne or whatever you want to call it. The one euphemism I find completely ridiculous is 'restroom'. Unless they are in an extremely fancy restaurant or public building, most public bathrooms are not all that restful. 'Bathroom', by the way, just means a place where you perform sanitary acts involving water. Enough of this.

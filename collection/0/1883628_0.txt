My ways are, concentrate totally on the sensation of breathing. My mind will wander, I give it 2 seconds to wander and then bring it back. Over and over I focus more and more on the feeling and sound of breathing in and breathing out. I don't manipulate my breathing, just allow it to be. That's one way that's easy.

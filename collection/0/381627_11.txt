It depends on your tolerance to pain. 99% of the time it is just a little pinch and then it is over. Some people scream before the needle even goes in, but that's just anxiety about the needle. Sometimes it may hurt just a little bit more if your veins are harder to find and the phlebotomist has to probe under your skin to reach your vein(painless i promise), but if u r the scary type, close your eyes or look away and count to ten(that's what i tell my patients lol)and by that time it will be over.

He is unfair to ask you to do this. Desperate people act desperate. I had two good friends get in a similar situation in college. One skipped town and the other had to make 5 years worth of payments. It isn't like you are super close with this person. Has he asked his parents to cosign? That is what family is for. If they don't trust him, you should be weary.

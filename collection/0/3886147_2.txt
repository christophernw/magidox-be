The problem is in the generation gap. It is commenly known that a short life leads to good "survival of the fittest" but it now we do not follow the golden rule of nature. Therefore, in the same light as allowing disabled people to reproduce, we are not caring for nature. ie we do not care about ecosystems because they will not affect us in our life time. So the things that we consider to make us human are logically going to make us extinct. Look at any major breakthrough we make; it is to destroy and not sustain.

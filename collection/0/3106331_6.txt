Nobody knows that, some say God, some say other things, what the biggest estimate is is that after the creation of the universe, all the rock matter got so compacted together that it exploded (Big Bang Theory) and created several planets. The Earth used to be extremely hot and incapable of life but after awhile we had like a billion year rain that filled the oceans and gave life which in turn created photosynthesis and made oxygen and life.

I like to think we don't take ourselves as seriousley as the people from Europe...I think a better question would be...how can a country allow it's leader to murder the people, rape, torture and kill...? There are some "vial" minded pple here in America...but at least we treat each other as humans, at least we live free. I personally enjoy "reproduction". Here in American...we do it for fun!

you'll either have to wait until you've levelled up enough to start getting it from dead enemies, or you can go to the ayleid ruins called Vindasel,  west of old bridge,  which is south of imperial city waterfront, across lake rumare.  Anyway you can get a full set inside the ruins from Umbra (you have to kill her) and  a powerful sword also called Umbra.

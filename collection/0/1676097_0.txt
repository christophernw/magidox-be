Giving Palestine to the Jews after WW2, was a mistake, hasn't worked out, and should be recognised as such.. . The policy of the USA leaders isn't helping matters, without their support peace will never be possible.. . We need a revolution in the USA first before anything else can happen. Hopefully with the increasing national debt, dependency on and shortage of oil, and the worsening living standards of poor Americans ,the revolution wont be far off

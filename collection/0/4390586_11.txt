Position the mirrors on your doors so that you can see the lines on the road and the cars on the sides of you.  You should not have them facing to see down the side of your car and the top, but rather toward the bottom.  You can see the top from your rear view mirror.  Glance in them every now and then if you're not sure you're in the middle.  You should be able to see the lines on the road in your side mirrors.  You will get used to what it looks like to be in the middle eventually.

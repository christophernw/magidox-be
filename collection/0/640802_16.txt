If you have the plague on your teeth then you are in serious trouble.he he    Plaque is a build-up of food debris and bacteria that has to be removed every twenty-four hours or it will turn into acid and may cause decay.  The best way to remove plaque is with a good soft toothbrush manual or electric, some dental floss, and a mouth rinse if you desire.  You can also invest in some of the old fashioned disclosing tablets that turn the plaque on your teeth a yucky pink. Once you can see it you can remove it.  I use disclosing solution on all of my new patients so they can see how good or badly they are brushing and flossing. You have to floss everyday without fail or you are not removing the yuck from in between your teeth.  Also make sure not to scrub your teeth, but gently brush in a small circular pattern to get better coverage.  Srubbing can cause your gums to recede and cause tooth sensitivity.  Also not using a soft toothbrush can do the same thing.  All of those med. and hard toothbrushes on the market are for people that wear dentures, DON'T use them, they are too hard on your teeth and can cause excess wearing away of your enamel.  A regular dental check-up and cleaning along with the proper home-care,can help you keep the smile you want.

Taking off in a puddle-jumper from Farmington, NM airport right when a very strong cold front hit the airport.  We had to fly into the front then make a U-turn after we took off.  In the air, the plane plane slid sideways for what felt like 100 ft., and the rest of the trip the plane kept dropping and rising like a roller-coaster.

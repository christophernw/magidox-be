Native Americans are called "Indians" because initally Columbus and other explorers thought they'd found a way to India.  The name just stuck because the name "America" wasn't widely used and they weren't exactly concerned with being "Politically Correct" back then.  Many of the different Native American tribes weren't even unified either, so they were often recognized by tribe because some were friendly to European settlers, some weren't.

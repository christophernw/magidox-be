Throuhout history, when a new religion comes in to play, it quickly "demonizes" the old religion.  In a sense running it down, and leading people to believe it's followers are evil, etc.. . But how can that effect Hollywood?  We are all more under the influence of Christianity more than we think. . . It can take hundreds of years for the prominent religion to die out.  Especially in cases where political force was used in the past.

A gentleman is a guy who always treats everyone with respect, holds the door for others, offers help anytime, respects others and their opinions, doesn't pass judgement on others, cares about the feelings of others, always puts others' feelings ahead of his own, always acts decently, never discusses things that should remain private......etc.  With regards to women, he treats them with the utmost respect, never rushing anything, never having a hidden agenda with the ladies, never tries to force them to do anything, and never tires of trying to make the ladies as happy as possible.  A gentleman is kind, caring, affectionate, loving, respectful, warm, gentle, sweet, and always doing what he can to make everyone feel at ease, and always trying to make everyone have a good day by doing even the smallest of deeds.  He is charming and sophisticated in a simple and humble manner.  He is sincere, honest, and devoted.  There are far too many things to describe the true aspect of the gentleman, but i hope that these things give you an idea of the makings of a gentleman.

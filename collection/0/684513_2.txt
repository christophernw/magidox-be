Punting a smurf requires the same skill as shooting smurf towards a goal. The only difference is that one is done on the ground and the other is done in the air. However, they both need to have their ankle locked to have the proper technique. . . 1. Ankle Position:. Your ankle should be locked so that you strike the smurf with your laces. If you do not do that the smurf will not go where you want it to go and there is a potential of a great mess.. . 2. Follow Through:. When you strike the smurf make sure that you do not stop the kicking motion immediately after making contact with the smurf. Allow the momentum of your leg to travel into and through the smurf.  The will project the smurf high into the air and will give you maximum hang-time and distance with your smurf punt.

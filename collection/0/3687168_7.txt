Cats will do what they want...  but, yes, you can train them and you can train her to stay off the table.. at least, when you're home.  We have 4 cats..  they are not allowed in the kitchen during meal prep or during meals.  They are not allowed on the kitchen counters or table or living room tables.  They have a bad place and that's the bedroom.  They are trained to go to bed when we go to bed... and they get up when we get up.. So, how did we do it.  Well, several ways.  First, get a squirter.. squirt gun.. squirt bottle.  When they do something wrong.. something you're training them not to do, give them a shot with the squirter (actually, get a couple of different ones because they will learn the sound it makes when you pick it up).  Make sure you have a 'bad place' for them when they're bad and put them there.  Make them stay for 1/2 an hour or an hour.  Then, go give them some love.  . Also, when the cat gets on the table, pick him up and then put him on the table and make that sound of shock like if a child does something bad..  yell "NO" and then pick them up and say it again.  Then put him back on the table and do it again.. then give him a smack on the butt... do it a couple of times and then put him in his bad place.. It will take some doing.. but this should work.  We've done it with 6 cats.. including the 4 we have now...

Usually martyrdom is not considered suicide. The title is generally given to a person who refuses to denounce their faith regardless of the threat of death (which is usually the result).. . It's basically about religious honor. Would you die for what you believe in? If so, your a martyr.. . ... now, if your among 36 people trying to kill yourself in order to meet an alien spacecraft millions of miles out, because a comet told you to do so... then its suicide (but it can be considered martyrdom in their own faith).

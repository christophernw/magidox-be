That horrifies me.  If one of my children turned out to be gay, I would hurt for them, and the pain they would have to endure from the likes of the people you quoted.  I wouldn't want to add to their pain.  I would think any parent would want their relationship with their child to be the one safe, accepting harbor they can count on at any time during their life.  My children are my children,  what their sexuality is has no bearing on that.

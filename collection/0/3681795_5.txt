I can say that I must be a rare exception. I'm a Freak about washing my hands. BUT, I used to have a friend who wouldn't even wash her hands after going #2..And, if there was water involved there was no soap!! YUCK!! Her reasoning was "It's not like you get any on your hands, that's what t.p. is for"...GROSS!

I don't think it is terribly important at all.  Reviewers always make a big deal out of this, but replacement batteries are available online, and it is a small matter to open up your device and install the new one.  It will void your warrantee, though.  Usually the original battery outlasts the warrantee, so it is no big deal anyway.

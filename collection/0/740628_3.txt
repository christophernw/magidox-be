A SIMILAR QUESTION WAS IN MY LOCAL PAPER A FEW WEEKS BACK.  THE PAPER SAID THAT PUTTING DOWN A WIRE MESH TYPE BARACADE OVER AND AROUND YOUR FLOWERS IS A GOOD WAY. THEY CAN'T DIG MUCH ESPECIALLY IF YOU GET THE WIRE WITH THE SMALLEST SQUARING TO IT THAT YOUR PLANTS WILL ALLOW. AFTER SEEING THEY CAN'T DIG THEY WILL GIVE UP AFTER TIME. MOTHBALLS MAY HAVE A STINKY SMELL BUT IF EATEN CAN BE HARMFUL.

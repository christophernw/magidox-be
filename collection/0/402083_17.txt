life can be simple or complicated, I have found a good way to be content is asking yourself the following question, Do I want it, or Do I need it. and when you can answer that for yourself then you will hopefully feel more content, and as a matter of interest it is also the secret to looking after your money. do i want it or do i need it. sounds the same but there is a vast difference.

As pathetic as you think this country is, be grateful that if your girlfriend falsely accuses you of, say, domestice violence (and it happens a LOT), that the burden of proof is upon the government, not upon you to prove innocence.  Read your philosophers like Thomas Jefferson; "I would rather be exposed to the inconveniencies attending too much liberty than those attending too small a degree of it.". Everyone is innnocent until they are proven guilty.  THEN they are a criminal.

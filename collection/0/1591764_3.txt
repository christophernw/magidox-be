Cut up lemons, it worked for me. My female tortie (checked by vet no medical problems) began urinating in the corner of the dining room.  I tried every repellent/odor remover product and nothing worked.  The other day I was cutting up lemons and my cat jumped off the counter because she did not like the smell of lemons.  That got me thinking about using lemons in the corner of the dining room to repel her from urinating there.  I cut 3 lemons in quarters and placed them the the corner of the dining room...and lo and behold she has NOT gone near the place in 2 days, and the lemons are absorbing the odor of urine.  Although I cannot guarantee the same results for you, its worth a try and lemons are cheap compared to the high priced products claiming to "guarantee" results.. . Issy

so, you'd rather pay a lawyer instead of using that money to take care of your child? NO ONE (agency or the law) should HAVE to tell you to take care of your child.Your wife shouldn't have to file in the first place.Hopefully, you won't pick up your check one day and find half of it missing.You WILL be contacted.You STILL have a chance to right some wrongs...(do you visit your child)?you can send money, be sure to keep all receipts! ( Take them to court when you go).

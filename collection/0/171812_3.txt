A lot people will tell you about yellow skin and nails and see your doctor  and all kinds of stuff, but I will tell you how to protect your liver, and it is quite simple, go to your local herbalist and get a thing called MILK THISTLE, this comes in tablet form or tincture, this milk thistle helps rejuvenate your liver, but that does not mean that you can continue to abuse alcohol, stay safe :Â¬)

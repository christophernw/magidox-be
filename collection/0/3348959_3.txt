I will say somethin about one type of suicide. The most common in the western world is from deppression. The most common of these being, people with sexual abuse in childhood. The weight of all of the cultures shame and judgment lays on their back. The typical "wait untill your married for sex" and the like. They did not have a choice and it as often hidden and a secret for years. This alienates them from the family and often the family sides with the abuser. . The next most common is people that no one loves and no friends.. The next is veterans of war that have done or seen terrible things, this haunts them.. . Oddly enough suicides are the products of a society and it shortcomings. I would have thought that fear of hell would keep people from suicide but their emotional suffering must be incredible.

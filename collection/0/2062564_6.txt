You need to clarify where the smell is that you want to get rid of.  If it is in the air then burn a candle to help.  If it is in your hair or clothes then they need to be washed.  If it is in your furniture then you need to clean the furniture or at least use a spray made to freshen furniture.  If this friend does not live with you then tell them from here on in they have to smoke outside if they come to visit and you cannot tolerate the cigarette smoke.

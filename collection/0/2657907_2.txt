O.K, first don't listen to them, and second, damn them to hell. (EDIT: I meant the senders of the message) It's just a bunch of SPAM and right now, you have the possibilty of adware and spyware on your computer. Try Ad-Aware. Now, you shouldn't give your e-mail or name to anyone online, unless they are a completely trusted source. When you go to a website, that if a big company, it just might not be fake, such as when Readers Digest asks you for their e-mail address if you want to be part of their newsletter it might be ok because companies like Microsoft and RD have enough money as it is, that asks you for emails, passwords, names, you name it, look for a Security certificate. you can find them by looking around the edges of your browser and looking for a lock.. . Delete that message right away and switch to a mail client that offers you Spam protection.. . . -crad010

This is just another fine benchmark of a group of people who believe in births without fathers, ressurection, and original sin. If you are going to buy the boat, might as well throw in the oars. Some one appointed christians as the supreme holders of Gods commands, and sole interpreters. You can tell this is a hoax since every sect, and denomination of christianity interprets the book slightly differently.

Hey there your thermostat needs to be replaced its not your head gasket it has no effect with your heat control  so get your thermostat replaced and get your radiator flushed and fresh anti-freeze put back in it maybe your heater core too and thats a pain in the butt to change i'd take it in to a shop for that to be done  but any of this  get it replaced and your car should be running cool again and blowing hot air when you want it  hope this info was help full

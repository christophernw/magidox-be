This does sound like a blown fuse.  Use you manual to locate the fuse box or try technical on-line support.  Often public libraries have manuals which cover several kinds of car, but might have info as to where the fuses are.. Always replace with the exact same size and shape fuse and carry a spare in you glove box or trunk.

like every profession theres bound to be idiots who go to far. if you look at almost every incident that gets brought to the medias attention, take a look and see if that officer is still employed.  i can think of no incident in my area or around the country that either a justified or unjustified action didn't cost a cop his job, wife, attorneys fees or worse.  try having that kind of scrutiny at your job

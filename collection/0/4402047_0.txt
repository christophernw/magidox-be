Lime and salt does not accentuate a great mexican beer, but has great a long standing tradition among mexican people.  It dates back to the  mexican revolution where in oaxaca the reveloutionaries had nothing left but limes and beer, to survive on until they took Mexico City.  . Later people added salt to counter act the sourness of the lime.

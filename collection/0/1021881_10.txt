Kinky.. Beautifully symbolic folk tale, huh.... . First, there is the theme of how too much curiousity and knowledge gets a person in trouble. It is a perfect way to keep people quiet: don't try to understand or you will be punished eternally. WOO HOO. That sure worked well, if one looks at the centuries during which research was forbidden - medical research, cosmology, astronomics... anything with the exception of theology. . . Second, the part in which Eve - the woman - is the source of evil, the vector of perdition for man. If we take the story literally, the only reason Eve did, is because god himself wanted her to do so - he is the powerful creator, and all the set up was done knowing perfectly the results. And Adam, that simpleton, ate the apple. This too worked well for millenaries, effectively putting women in subservient position. For centuries, there was even a debate if women had a soul - but then, even without a soul, they could be burned as witches - I fail to see the goal here, a being without a soul cannot have a god, right?

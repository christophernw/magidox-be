I dunno, it might be the fact that there weren't all that many Mexicans in Germany at the time.. . Nazi sentiment against Jews is similar to current anti-Semite sentiment; there was and is a belief among anti-Semites that too much power and wealth is concentrated in Jewish hands. This was often despite the fact that European Jews were often forced to live in ghettos and were often kept quite poor, but may be influenced by the economic mechantile power of some Jewish communities in the late Middle-Ages, for example in the Ottoman Empire.. . Anyway, Hitler and the Nazis didn't pick only on the Jewish; he also exterminated homosexuals, gypsies, almost anyone with a mental disability and many people with severe physical disabilities, etc. Nazis wanted to try to "purify" the German race, forcibly removing undesired elements from the gene pool. The Nazis at first reportedly attempted mass-deportations, but no country would accept the German-labeled undesireables; instead, Hitler was forced to keep what he considered garbage at home, built concentration camps, and eventually extermination camps.. . The fact that we always hear about the Jews to the exclusion of these other groups is that the Jewish community was and is a cohesive and quite large and influential group, while there is no real unity between Gypsies, nor do they have any appreciable political power anywhere. Therefore, affected Jews would be better able to give their horrible experiences voice than other groups, perhaps drowning them out.. . I don't mean this as an anti-Semite thing, and don't even try to take what I wrote out of context!

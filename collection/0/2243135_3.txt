A smudging ceremoney involves the use of Sacred Sage, used to cover the smell of humans when in Native American ceremonies. It is also used to clear away spirits who do not belong where they are, from what I have read. More information can be obtained from a Native American website, or community center. I hope this helps . . .                                                                                       LoneWolf.

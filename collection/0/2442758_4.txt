Catholics ARE christians, but today people generally use the terms to divide Christians into two camps....the Catholic/Anglican/Orthodox sect and all other Christian relgions.. . In short, there are two major differences.. . 1.  Catholics accept the tradition of the Church.  That the institution of the Church, since the first days of Christianity, is important to theology.  That, essentially, theology is organic and evolving through the Church.  "Christians" beleive only the bible is necessary for theology, not the Church.. . 2.  Catholics beleive in work and faith.  This means that in addition to believing in Jesus, you have to be a good person and do good things to go to heaven.  "Christians", in generally, believe only in faith to get into heaven.. . Everything else generally stems from those two issues.

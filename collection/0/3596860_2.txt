There is some debate on how to pronounce Hebrew.  For a long time we thought that the proper transliteration would have been JHVH, not YHWH.  There is still a big debate about the "W" or the "V" sound.  Hebrew originally had no vowels, so we don't really even know how many syllables a word had.  "Yahweh" is still our best guess on how to pronounce the Hebrew word.  Years ago "Jehovah" was our best guess.  To say that it is pronounced "Yahweh," however, is not entirely accurate.  It is how we believe it should be pronounced.  While I also tend to prefer it over "Jehovah," we must acknowledge that "Jehovah" is not necessarily, wrong.

A kidney infection or medically known as Pyelonephritis is caused by Strep infection which is a bacteria (E. coli, klebsiella, etc.) If you have one and havent seen a Dr. I urge that you do ASAP..Kidney infections are dangerous & nothing to take lightly...If left untreated, they can cause blood poisoning, loss of a kidney, or perhaps even death!!!

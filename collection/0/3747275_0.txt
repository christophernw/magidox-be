we can't get any thing without any effort , sucess , lover, mony... 1-if I want to have somthing special , I have to be special . 2-if I want to have a lover , I have to look at me in the mirror , stop wining , and  say what should I do to deserve a lover. . 3- but being (special) doesn't mean to be(perfect)  I don't have to be a perfect humanbeing ( like movie stars) , I'm a regular person trying to live my day like others do, I have small goals ,trying to acheive them , that's it!!

I would first take him to the vet to rule out a bladder or uninary tract infection...when a cat urinates around the house it may be trying to tell you something is wrong.  If it is medical...it will be much easier to solve than if this is just behavioral.  Take him to the vet for a urinalysis to see if an infection is the cause.  If not, ask you vet for advice on treating the problem if it is behavioral.

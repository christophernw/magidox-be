wrong question... how does an artist find a job. and sell art work.  Visited with an artist in. Colorado who sold leather belts and wallets for. years and painted nights who now sells his paintings. for thousands of dollars and never does leather work.. I tell people, I taught school as a hobby and painted. to make a living.  It may take years before artwork. sells, but like anything else, the more you practice, . the better you will become.

Science is the search for what is true about our world.  If Christianity is true, and if science is done properly, then scientists WILL discover either that Christianity is true, or that it cannot be determined by their methods and current state of knowledge.. . Science changes, and this is what makes it great.  The science book is never closed.  If you can demonstrate that a theory is wrong, then you are welcome to do so.  You are welcome to fight the theories of science.........but in order to be effective, you must fight it with acceptable science.  You must bring evidence.. . If you say the Bible is true, then show me evidence that it is true.  If you cannot show that it is true, then why should I believe what it says, over what the Epic of Gilgamesh says?

Joseph Smith returned them to Moroni when he was done with them.. . I don't find it so hard to believe that the Bible doesn't mention Moroni.  After all, Moroni lived at about 400 A.D. on the American continent, quite a long distance in geography and time from the people who wrote the Bible.  The Bible DOES say, however, that Jesus taught that he had other sheep which were "not of this fold".  He was talking about His children who were living on the American continent.

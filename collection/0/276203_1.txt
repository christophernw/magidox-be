kind or model?  KIND would be 4wd because milage doesnt concern me too much, but traction in deep snow does....MODEL would be lexus IS300 because its a luxury type car available with a manual, and rwd so fun to drive...4dr so very practical.  .....also, i guess under "KIND" i would include japanese because i believe they are the most reliable.

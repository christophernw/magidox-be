Distilled water would come from vapor. When dirty water varprizes, the dirt particles stay down and only the pure water particles go up, then you gather them, lower the temperature and turn it back into liquid, which would be really pure.. Drinking water is just passed thru filters wich try do do their best at "filtering" impurities in the water, but all the time some of the impurities sneak thru.

First off, each religion believes in whatever faith they chose to and each is real to them. Every religion thinks they are the right one.. However, the Bible was writen far before Jesus was born, and prophesized his life. Either the men that wrote it were amazing psychics, or there really is a God that told these men those things.. Believe what you want, but isn't it easier to believe in something like this than that we all came from bacteria? Besides, I would rather live my whole life believing the Bible and then be wrong, than deny Christ and find out I was going to Hell.

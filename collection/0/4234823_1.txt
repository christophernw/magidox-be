The sad part is that the Palestinians arn't any better toward the Israelis.  Why can't we all just get along?  We do here in the states!  It really is not hard accepting other people and their cultures and religions.  Why is it so hard everywhere else?  I just don't understand it.  It can be done....we've proved it here!

Honestly, you're really gonna have to bite the bullet and tell her!  Maybe you can just send her a little note saying that her loud convos outside your door are bothering your customers and you would appreciate it if she can take her phone calls elsewhere.  Either that, or when she gets one of her phone calls, go outside and take a smoke break, and always blow it in her direction.  That'll get her to move!  LOL

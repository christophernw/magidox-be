I believe that conscience does not exist as a virtue regulator for any person on its own, for otherwise philosophers of all time weren't going to have trouble defining virtue.. . Besides this, how can you compare conscience with common sense? Traditionally you will seperate it by saying that common sense is used in less-harmful issues and conscience is used in high moral situations, such as murder etc.. . Personally, I believe that the effect of "conscience" on the self is merely a response of a core belief system with many beliefs, attitudes, principles & values pre-programmed since childhood to determine how you're going to react or feel to any possible situation.. . Conclusive belief: Conscience as the general public believes does not exist as an external spiritual regulator (that would even violate free will somehow), but rather it's based on each person's schema.. . (Psychology) Schema: A pattern imposed on complex reality or experience to assist in explaining it, mediate perception, or guide response.

It's not necessary, but its suggested because peanut oil is one of the most available cooking oil in China, the other being animal fat.   It has a good flavor and great for use in the Wok, because it has a high smoking point and proper stir fry require high heat to dry up the liquids in the bottom of the wok.  Peanut oil is one of the healthiest oil to fry with.  Its not so popular in the US because it spoils easy and there is concern of peanut allergies.

Don't pat yourself on the back too hard, now. The companies use illegal-I want to emphasis the word use-to make a bigger profit for themselves. If they hired legals and Americans, they would have to pay them at least minimum wage. It is not a matter of others not being physically able to do the work, it is just that with a legal/America, we have all kinds of taxes to pay that we can not afford to accept what they pay to illegals. Since illegals do not have to pay those taxes, they do not have that problem.. . Yes illegals work hard but don't fool yourself; the moment the companies can get a robot to do the work, you will be history also. The companies only care about the bottom line.

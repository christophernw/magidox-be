Think about it, Idaho's population isn't as diverse for one, so there are very few if any black women competing for Miss Idaho.  Second of all, Idaho doesn't have a high population so the odds of Miss Idaho winning Miss America, black or white, is minimal.  I don't believe there has even been a white Miss America from Idaho.

One reason could be because you sleep late. Try to aim for about 9 hours of sleep a night!!! . Circles can be caused by genetics (if you parents had them?) or just by tiny broken blood vessels under your eyes. 1. 1)Try sleeping for longer, . 2) using a higher pillow so blood flow under your eyes circulates more, . 3) drink more water (it makes your skin look healthier, and boosts circulation). 4) eat high fiber diets (helps absorb excess fluid). . Ahh, I know how annoying they can be. I had them and I still have them, though when I used thsi thing called VITA-K solution for dark circles under eyes (11 dollars, drugstores) it helped for a little, but it returned to normal after a while :-(. . good luck!!!!!

Actually its played when ENGLAND win, not Brits. Britain constitutes England, Scotland, Wales, Isle of Man and other small islands.. . God Save the Queen (or King) is the official National Anthem of the United Kingdom (which has the constituent nations of England, Scotland, Wales, N. Ireland). The individual nations of the UK do not have offical national anthems although there are some songs which are widely considered to be so. Wales has Land of My Fathers, Scotland has Flower of Scotland, Northern Ireland uses Danny Boy. For England whilst Land of Hope and Glory is widely considered to be an alternative National ANthem there is broad debate over whether to use that or Jerusalem, a hymn which uses the words from William Blakes preface to Milton:A Poem. Rugby matches always have Jerusalem.. . Persoanlly I would rather have Jerusalem!. . Oh and by the way, Land of Hope and Glory and Jerusalem are both a sarcastic view of the England, so its quite ironic that songs that were originally taking a slight dig at England are now considered to be our un-official national anthems.

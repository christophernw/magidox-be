People are judgemental because we have to be. We need to be able to judge, people, enviorment, information and situations in order to make choices and move forward in life.. . What you actually want is for people to be willing to take in new information and revise their judegements.  It's when people are extreme and closed minded there are problems.  . . As to why people are closed mind?  I find the most common reasons are Hate, Fear and pain.

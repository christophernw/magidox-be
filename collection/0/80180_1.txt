If the person's fraud was so "obvious", it seems reasonable to assume that the SSA would have caught on, doesn't it? All any civic-minded person can do is report what they know and leave it alone. Sooner or later, things will catch up with that person, and the further you distance yourself from the whole thing, the better off you will be. Don't obsess about this. There are many more wrongs to help set right in the world. You did your best with this one. Move on.. . The only thing that would cause me to suggest that you continue to pursue "justice" would be if you personally were somehow directly involved with the fraud, or are somehow personally, directly benefitting from it. If that's the case, I would suggest you speak with an attorney, to assist in clarifying your criminal liability.. . Since you've stated that you weren't close with the person, being implicated doesn't seem likely, so, my advice of moving on stands.

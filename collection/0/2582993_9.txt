Hey I say that there were dinosaurs.  I have no problem admitting that.  Now what are we talkin about here?  Macro or Micro Evolution?  . Micro evolution, I know to be true.  I think everybody has heard the stories about the grey and white moths in the polluted city.. Macro.... Nah... Sorry I still dont see how a lizard can turn into a rhino in acouple million years.  Again if we came from monkeys...why are there still monkeys?  I guess we were just in the gifted class.  Whatever.  . The seven day thing.  Okay I'm gonna stick with my guns, which really wont make any difference to you because you chose not to believe what I say away.  But the Bible does refer to days as thousands of years to God.  Maybe the seven day thing was symbolism, hell Maybe God did it in seven actual days.  I really dont care.  Dinos yeah they were here, yeah they died, and yeah they still have their fossilized bones in the ground.  . (BTW could you people PLEASE stop using the idiotic rantings of the EXTREME fundamentalists, I know that the devil didnt put them there and anyone who is not blinded by his or her charasmatic hellfire preaching christian cult leader does too...). I know that scientists have found that the Dinos died out from the world making a drastic temperature/weather change, maybe it was Noah's flood, maybe not.  I dont really know, and nobody will ever know.  I wish I did.

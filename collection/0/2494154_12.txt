leaving? where are you going?  getting raptured tomorrow?  . . and how typical is your egocentric human thinking.  selfish and self absorbed beyond measure.  tho the ball of dirt we human inhabit is in no danger the Earth's Eco systems are and all the beautiful and diverse creatures that call those Eco systems home are certainly endangered.  but what do you care.  right?   you're going to whisked away to "heaven" so Earth and all it's wondrous life are disposable.

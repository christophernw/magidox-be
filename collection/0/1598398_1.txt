i feel the rainbow is a promise. it symbolizes trust. if you are a christian, you would know that when God flooded the world, he told Noah to build an ark, after the forty day flood, he showed the rainbow as a promise to never flood the entire world again. that's what a rainbow represents and i feel that i can alway trust God

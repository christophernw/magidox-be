Traditional Diet Coke is "sweetened" using aspartame (Nurtrasweet). There is a version out that uses sucralose (Splenda).. . Coke Zero is listed as the sugar free version of Coke Classic and is "sweetened" using a mixture of aspartame (Neutrasweet) and Acesulfame potassium  (Ace K).. . I do think that they taste different from one another. Some folks say that Coke Zero tastes more like regular Coke. I don't think so!

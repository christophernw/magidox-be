It's how they or any other fast food franchise run their marketing.  They want to expel a positive image and even though statistics show that many Americans are overweight, the idea of being overweight is negative and wouldn't be beneficial to McDonald's, as unfair as it might sound.  They just want to earn money.  Also, an interesting thing to think about, you don't see fat people in 24 Hour Fitness ads!  But I see alot of them at my gym so... it's just the marketing.  Nothing to get all huffed up about.

My son is almost three. In February a tumor was removed from his face. Did God put the histiocitosis there to test my faith? Is it a miracle that my son stared death in the face and wouldn't let the tumor enter his brain? Is the doctor that took the tumor from his head, and charged me 8000 dollars, was he using the healing power of Jesus, or the power of science, which through expirimentation on other children, developed a medicine to heal him?. . On the Saturday afternoon after the surgery, he lied in this hospital bed looking at me.  I smiled at him and told him it was going to be ok.  This child, whose skull was infected, and had skull removed, looked at me with a bandage on one side, and looked deep into me, and saw a strength and a love of a father. Is this a miracle, that two souls, father and son, can look deep into one another, . . on the Tuesday that followed, he was running trying to play with toys.. . Perhaps 2000 years ago without an MRI or a CAT scan humans didn't know that the things growing in our bodies are tumors.  Without the ability to know what they were doing, Roman doctors would perform lombotomys.. . Kinda brings to mind the joke,  the Roman doctor who performed lombotomies, the Jewish doctor, the Indian doctor who charged me 8000 dollars, Jesus, and a rabbi, and a father walk into a room to remove a malignant tumor from a 2 year old boy's body and the bartender said what anesthia are you having?. . I don't know.  I don't know if his recovery is a miracle. Is it survival, is it genetic, was it Jesus, was it the doctor.. . I will tell you this, if you ever have to stare at the eye of a child after such a procedure, if it comforts you to ask Jesus, then ask him.

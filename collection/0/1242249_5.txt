the reason is actually unknown. most believe that it has to do with light. it's possible that thick thunderstorm clouds, with alot of water vapor, rain and hail, can scatter sunlight and give the clouds a blue hue.  and since thunderstorms freguently occur in the afternoon and evening, the sun is low in the sky, and the reddening light as seen during sunset makes the bluish hue turn green.

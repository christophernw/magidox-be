I hope you won't hit,beat or kick/stomp your dog!Please do not shake a can full of pennies at it either it may feel it would need to defend its self,and try to bite the can and bite you by mistake. When she starts whining don't baby her that only encourages her to keep doing it.Ignore her if you can't put her in another room,when she stops whinning let her back in.If she starts whining again put her back in the other room untill she stops then let her back in again. Keep doing this it won't take long for her to realize whinning is not accepted.

I would think to reduce heat, and burns and dirt and things....back when they were running around half naked and no panties I assume.  Also the reduction in friction during intercourse, and maybe for recognition.....If  you are running around naked and you don't have a language and all you do is grunt....and you need a mate to reproduce maybe you find out who are ready to mate by if they are "haired out".  Usually the growth of pubic hair comes with puberty and girls are able to have babies at that time..

The first thing you should have done was not to quit but to work the chain of command.  . Now that you have left the only way to show them is to get on with your life and not look back.  If you were really as good an employee as you say you were then you can find another good job.  . Don't let them keep a hold on you by trying to think of ways to hurt them.  It will only tear you up inside.  Don't be that person.. Find something better, you can do it.

They are foolish and have to have someone to blame.. Because in America today there are alot of people in a "it's all about me" stage.I,I,I, me,me,me is what causes. it.They don't care about anyone but themselves much less what is going on in other countries.Also there is more tax on gas in other countries.. I'm not trying to be mean just answering your question.

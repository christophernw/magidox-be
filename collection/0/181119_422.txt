Anything outside, depending on where you live and if you can stand the heat.  I think a camp counselor would be great if you like kids.  Go to Canada for a portage leader.  Or go to the Yellowstone area.  Any job in Big Sky Country would be great.  You could lead trail rides on horseback.  Get your Lifeguard certification if you like the beach scean.  Or get a job on a cruise ship; go to Alaska!

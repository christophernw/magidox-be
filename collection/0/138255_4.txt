As your engine runs, it uses the oil to lubricate its moving parts and remove excess heat from the block.  Modern motor oil especially has many different lubricants and detergents in it to help keep the engine running smoothly (significantly reducing internal friction) and to take rust and other impurities away.  Eventually (after about 3,000-5,000 miles or three months), the lubricants and cleaners break down and are of no longer use.. . The oil also removes particulate matter from the engine.  If you never change the oil in your engine, it will eventually become thick with grime and burnt particles and no longer protect the block.  The oil change interval is set so that you replace the oil when it is beginning to fail.. . Failure to change the oil in a car is the most common cause of engine damage.  Keeping up with regular change intervals can all but prevent major problems with the engine.

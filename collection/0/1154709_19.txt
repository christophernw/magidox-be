Some people have a faster matabalism than others, maybe this is you. You may want to try eatting several small meals a day with fewer hours in between, your body is telling you that you need something so maybe a candy bar w/ a drink or crackers. This will also keep you from eatting larger meals at meal time. Lots of luck! PHB

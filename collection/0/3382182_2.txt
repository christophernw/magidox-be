I THINK MALES ARE HARDER TO TRAIN THAN FEMALE(BY MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE) I HAVE A FEMALE DOBERMAN AND A MALE AMERICAN BULLDOG,AND SHE WAS A BREEZE TO TRAIN BUT HE WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND HE STILL IS..SHE IS CALM AND HE IS SO HYPER HE KNOCKS ALL MY STUFF OFF MT STANDS.. I LOVE HIM DEARLY BUT HE IS SOMETIMES A PAIN IN THE ASS..I WILL NOT GET ANOTHER MALE,I LIKE MY FEMALES..THEY ALSO SEEM TO BE MORE PROTECTIVE OVER THE FAMILY,WHERE ALL THE MALES I HAVE HAD WERE WAY TO FRIENDLY TO STRANGERS..MY AUSTRALIAN SHEPHERD WHO WAS A MALE WAS THE BEST DOG OUT OF ANY OF MY OTHER MALES..BUT ANY AUSSIE ARE VERY INTELLIGENT DOGS ANYHOW..

hahahahahaha!!! Torquoise, you must be on the tourism payroll! I do tend to agree that T & T have a lot going for it. My spouse and I are considering opening a buisness there. Thing is that Trinidad is better for commercial concerns and Tobago is the nature lover's location. There are, however, islands with super beaches and water that are 100% geared for tourist (say US) dollars. . . Take a BWIA flight to T & T and you will see the latest tourism documentary.

Dry sockets occur approximately 2 weeks after the extraction. They don't develop in a couple days. Dry sockets hurt worse than a regular toothache. You will know if you have one. Slight soreness is to be expected within a week or so of any extraction, especially oral surgery. . Take 800 mg of IBProfen every 6-8 hours and if the dentist gave you pain medicine, save it for night time so you can rest. . I hope this helps!

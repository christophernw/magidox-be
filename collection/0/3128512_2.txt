Because the time of heating is too short to even produce a feeling. To feel heat, it has to "burn" for about 0.5 - 1 sec. To cause burnings on Your skin, it has to burn for more than 1 sec. The temperature of the flame is about 400oC, but the produced heat is so small, that it can't hurt You when You move Your hand quickly over the flame. . . Try this: move hand over the flame several times - You will start to feel the heat, even if Your hand is far away from the flame. That's because the heat is accumulated in Your palm, and every time You move it over flame, some more heat is added.

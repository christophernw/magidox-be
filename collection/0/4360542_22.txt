what rediculous question .... what do u think america is doing in afghanistan , iraq??.. are they creating peace or destroying peace??.. whose making muslims blast cars, buildings in their own countries.... its all because of america and does christianity promote violence ? did Jesus said to make peace by blasting innocent people's house in afghanistan, iraq?.. . . Q'uran contains every kind of information to become more deep spiritual person... the people of Quran ( Muslims ) pray 5 times a day which makes them not to do anything bad.. . .  how about u take that question towards you?.. why do christians justify killing people everyday?.. be it in afghanistan, iraq or in america itself... .    brother..... your question is just baseless.

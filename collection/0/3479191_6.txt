Not all salt water fish are more colorful. The ones hobbyists pick out tend to be either more colorful, or more interesting in a behavioral sense. Sometimes color is for camo, like blending in with bright corals. Sometiems fish take on colors to blend in with other fish so that they can pretend to be that fish and school with them, even though they aren't related. Also sometimes bright colors help predators remember a bad taste or poisenous effect. . . If the first yellow fish you ate made you sick for days, you'd remember not to eat yellow the next time. You would probably stay away from that type of yellow fish, as well as all other yellow fish. That's why there are mimics in the sea.. . Also, check out some African cichilids. I have yellow ones, orange ones, green ones, and purple cichlids with red fins.. . Perception of a pretty color also might come from lighting in stores too. Salt water tanks tend to need different light temperatures/brightness. Look up Kelvins and different light temperatures. 10,000 K may be brighter, but can make a fish look duller than a fish under a 4,000 K light.

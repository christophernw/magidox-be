Because it is unfair to prosecute someone 10 years later. Witnesses may die or forget, evidence may go away.. in all actuality.. people can't remember what they had for breakfast yesterday, much less a crime 40 years ago.. . They do this so the person accused has a fair shot at an honest trial without time taking a toll on everyone.

First is the goal. What is rich? Many people say that 6 million dollars is needed to be rich in the USA.. . There are many ways to get rich. My idea is only one possible way, and it has three parts: Frugality, income and investments.. . Frugality is driving an older car, not buying expensive new TVs, etc. If you eat out in restaurants only order a house salad and not the entree. Don't give expensive Christmas gifts. You need to change your mindset from wanting to buy goods to enjoying saving money. Live a very economical life.. . You want a job with good income. There are many jobs which pay over $100k and don't have high risks. You can find those and then by being frugal you can invest most of your money.. . The most important part of getting rich is your investments and getting a good return. If you don't feel clever you can buy a safe fund and hope for 10% a year, putting away $100k from your job into investments every year. People say that over the long term stock markets tend to do well.. . If all goes well you can be rich in about 25 years.. . There are other ways to get rich, but my way doesn't require as much talent.. . Bill

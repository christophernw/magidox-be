1. AC generators: motors running as generators where magntetic field inside goes moves with respect to the pickup coils generating AC current (3 phase usually): most big power plants use this form of generation. 2. digitally generated AC: using PWM (pulse width modulation) or some other modulation scheme to create sinusoidal waveform. mostly used by smaller power plants, such as wind turbines, UPS, etc. 3. antenna picking up EM radiation which induces AC current

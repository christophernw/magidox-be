Well there is the standard evo 6 and the tme version as u say which is a tribute to tommy makkinen who is a world rally champion who took mitusibishi to many of their wrc wins. i believe it has a slightly more tweaked engine and others plus new additions in terms of the paint and interior, only a few were made as it was a special edition. it is also known as the evo 6.5.

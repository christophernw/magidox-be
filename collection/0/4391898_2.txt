I imagine part of it is maturity and what society has somehow accepted in our social setting.  I am not putting the younger generation down but it is clear that in their daily conversations, foul language plays a hearty role and is acceptable.  So, many probably feel it is okay to respond to answers with foul language as it habitual now.  . . As one guy pointed out, the foul language usually stems from someone posing an illiterate question and that person is simply reacting to it.  Others, I believe, just use as part of their normal day-to-day conversation; although like the guy said, there doesn't seem to be that much.. . For them, there is plenty of value below the surface, if this is the lingo that has taken precedent in their social arena.  If they are socializing with people of that same nature, no one would be turned off, as it seems to be typical conversation.  Those who might be listening nearby and do not cater to that kind of talk would be offended, though.. . I don't know that it makes them a loser but when you read responses where they are utilizing foul language to make a point, it makes it ridiculous and unintelligible.

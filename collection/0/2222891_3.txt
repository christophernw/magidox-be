Get plenty of chew toys. And always exercise your dog a lot so that when you're home your dog will be too exhausted to chew on furniture.  Also, try bitter apple spray. This may or may not work because some dogs develop a taste for it.. . If none of those work, then you're out of luck. When my now 5 year old miniature schanuzer was a puppy, he chewed on the legs of chairs, tables, and the wall! He always chewed off a part of the carpet. He finally outgrew it though, thank goodness! . . Also, one other thing is to catch your dog in the act. Do somethign that will really startle the bajeesus out of your dog and do it all the time you catch him. Two pots/pans that will make a loud banging noise is a good one to use. Do it really loud and if it works the first time, keep doing it. Pretty soon he'll know not to approach the furniture to chew on it. If pots and pans doesn't work, use somethign else.

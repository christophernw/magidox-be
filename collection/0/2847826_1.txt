I agree 100% with 'ekaty84'.  It's not always that they were abused with them, or even picked on by them.  Sometimes dogs are just afraid of them.  It seems to trigger a natural response in them, the same way it does in people when we see a snake or a spider, or mice.  Those fears aren't always reasonable, either.  . . I will vouch for Boston Terriers and English Bulldogs alike, that many of them are just apprehensive of them naturally.  My Bostons will actually *attack* the vacuum!  I try to attribute that to their rodent-hunting instincts, though I'm not entirely certain that that's it.  Maybe they see the big, noisy thing as a threat and some hide from it while others attack it to "protects us"?  I have to put them all in their crates before I use it.  My English Bulldog will actually crate herself when she sees the vacuum coming out.  Ha!. . When my litters are very small, I try to vacuum a teeny bit where they can see me, every day.  Not enough to be frightening or overwhelming, though.  I try to get them accustomed to it, though I haven't asked any of their people if it has worked...  Maybe I'll do that.  You have me wondering now.  *heh*. . Anyway, good luck to you, and just put your dog in another room while you're using the offensive items.  You could try leaving them laying out on the floor for a day or two, where your dog can sniff them and see that they don't move on their own, so to speak.  That might convince him/her that it's okay...  Just pretend that they're not there.  If your dog sees you being that nonchalant around them, it might help.

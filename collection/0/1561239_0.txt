The wording in your question asks why the highest POINT on a hill or mountain is not represented by a contour LINE. By definition, a line is a series of points, therefore a point cannot be represented, or defined, by a line. On a contour map there is usually a figure (number) indicating the highest point in the immediate area of the smallest contour circle line which represents the top of the hill.

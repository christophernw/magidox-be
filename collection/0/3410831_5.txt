Many  teachers find themselves in situations where they have had the opportunity to teach students from a variety of backgrounds.  One challenge that they are faced with in the classroom, is bringing together the class as a whole (socially, emotionally, and academically). Sometimes this is difficult, when the students may not have been exposed to multicultural environments.  To begin, the teacher must create trust in the classroom, somehow finding a way to break the barrier, so that teaching environment will prove effective.  In turn, an individual  teacher may also have discovered his or  her first experience in working with children from other cultures.  However, a good teacher . must love and have compassion for all types of people and personalities, no matter what walk of life they may have come from, realizing...that not everyone may have had the same opportunities and experiences.  You must not prejudge an individual in a way that lowers your expectations for them. You must learn to accept others, recognize their weaknesses, and help them to focus on their strengths.  You must really put forth the effort to investigate the individual's capabilities and learning styles.  The more time you spend getting to know an individual, & the more you understand an individual, the more accepting they become in your eyes. This is the beginning of effective teaching....accepting the individual as an equal human being, not based on where he came from.

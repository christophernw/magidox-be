Check your Distributor cap. If it's cracked..it will sometimes start the engine..n sometimes wont. It'll run perfect n start perfect one hour..then the next..it wont. it happened to me. I took out the distributor cap n noticed a crack doing down the middle..i replaced it and the car started perfect.

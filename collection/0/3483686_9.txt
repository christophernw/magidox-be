Ask Jesus into your heart.  To be the king of your life.  To make you a new person.  To give you a mind just like the mind that He had.  Ask Him to forgive you of the sins in your life.  To cleanse you from all unrighteousness.  Ask Him to help you become the person that HE wants you to be.  Ask Him to help you to love Him more than all of the world.  Always be willing to say not my will but thine be done.  Ask Him to save you now.

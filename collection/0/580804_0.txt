I use Nature's Miracle in my carpet cleaner.  (I don't know if this is recommended by the manufacturer, but it's hasn't hurt it in 2+ years)  It's an enzyme cleaner and I think it smells fresher longer than using carpet shampoo.  . . I also keep candles on an electric warmer.  Some of those Order eliminator candles work really well, like the ones the Hallmark Stores sell.  Other than that, I keep their bedding clean and use Fabreeze on my furniture.. . Keeping the animals themselves clean helps as well.  Most dogs can be bathed every 2 weeks without drying out their skin.

No one should get hateful and intolerant when asked about their belief. I am a christian. I believe in God the Father, Jesus the Son of God, and the Holy Ghost. . Other than what the holy bible says and my faith, prayers being answered, bills getting paid after losing my job, and a number of several minor miracles. I guess I couldn't explain it. I just take it by faith. That's enough for me. I'm sure others need more proof.

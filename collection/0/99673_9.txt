maybe it's because you still want his arms around you when you are sad or lonely...you still smile when you think about him...he's still in your dreams...you can still hear his voice in your head...your head might tell you to move on...but your heart might say different.  . . just some advice though...don't ask men to change...you'll have to change yourself because they will never change.

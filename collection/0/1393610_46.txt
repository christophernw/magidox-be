Funny ... Presidents changing the economy.. . Every Economist understands that the Economy has "Life Cycles"  These cycles can move in 30 years ... 70 years ... or 100 years.  . . Democratic F. D. Roosevelt cut the benefits of the military veterans <only to be vetoed><1> Additionally, FDR used the Milton Friedman model of economics. "These conditions included massive spending, price controls, bond campaigns, controls over raw materials, prohibitions on new housing and new automobiles, rationing, guaranteed cost-plus profits, subsidized wages, and the draft of 12 million soldiers." <2>  . . Hoover was a "Small Government" leader.  He valued the Private Corporations stance to fix the economy rather than government influences.  However, the president before Hoover <FDR> had run up lots of debt.  Hoover raised taxes <severely> to recover from the weight of the debt, and commenced foreign relations to spread out the money owed to other nations.  Hoover embraced the Keynesisan economics that FDR rejected. <3>

For increased surface area for cerebral functions (whatever they are). I personally believe that at some point early in our evolution we used our brains a lot LOT more than we do now (80-90% vs. 4%) for telekinesis, telepathy, be able to perceive more than 3 dimensions...and all sorts of things...even to ascend to a higher plane of existence.... But we seem to have lost that ability...(or been forced to forget??)

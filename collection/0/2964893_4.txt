as a health care worker all i can say is ask the government what they are doing with all the money from gst and our higher taxes.. our government doesnt think people are an important matter young or old or sick..just how much money will be lining there pockets from raises after raises .. and retirement packages after only a few years of work.. I think I am in the wrong field...I better stop here I am a nurse and I think it is a total shame especially to our elderly people the way the government who say they are for the people.. I just wonder which people ???

There was a big march in London about fees last weekend, and some guy in The Times reckoned students are "dinosaurs" for wanting to pay less and said they should demand to pay more. Dumbass. Something about it being fairer for us to pay then making everyone who doesnt even go there pay for it in their taxes. http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3561-2428844,00.html

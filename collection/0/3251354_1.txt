Assuming you're in the Northern Hemisphere, the sun actually is CLOSEST to Earth in the Winter, and FURTHER in the summer.  The summer warmth is actually the result of the angle at which the sun's rays hit the Earth...the sun is more overhead in the summer, and so we get the full strength of its heat because the rays just about hit the earth directly at an almost 90 degree angle.  In the winter, the sun stays lower in the sky, and so the rays don't hit us as directly---maybe a 30 degree difference in the angle.  As a result, we experience the cold of winter, even though the sun is CLOSEST to us during the winter!. The brightness is more of a measure of its output of light...the diiference in distance at aphelion and perihelion is negligible.

Bipolar is when an individual has sudden mood changes...contrary to belief symtoms include more than just being moody and angry. Any behavior changes such as sudden boosts of energy and feeling down one minute to extremely confident the next. I can not say that an individual could be half bipolar but can show the symptoms without actually being diagnosed as bipolar. I suggest researching this subject...You will be surprised by the actual definition ...

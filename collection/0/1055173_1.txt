I believe in one God, Who created all things by His spoken word.  The Holy Bible is the inspired Word of God written by His chosen people.  If it is understood as intended, there are no contradictions.  John 1:1 says "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." Then John 1:14 "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." (this refers to Jesus Christ) If you believe in God, then He cannot be separated from His Word.  If you don't believe the Bible is truth then how do you believe your prayers are answered?  Every prayer is answered, maybe sometimes not in the way we hoped.  The reason is, only God knows the alpha to the omega, and His plan for your life is wonderful.  The only reason He doesn"t answer like we hoped, is because our request is not His highest and best for us.  In hind sight, sometimes I thank God He didn't grant my prayer! God is Truth, He is His Word, The Holy Bible is the Word of God.

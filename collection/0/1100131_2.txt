Snoring is a big sign of sleep apnea. I would go to your doctor and see what he thinks about your snoring. I snore too, and i found out that i have sleep apnea, i only get like 50% of the O2 to my brain at night. But to stop it, you could try the strips or the spray that goes on the back of your throat.

Proverbs 6:17 mentions "a proud look" as one of the things that God hates.  I believe that this is a deadly sin because you are loving yourself and trying to prove yourself to others instead of trying to be the best Christian in God's eyes.  It doesn't matter what other people think, all that matters is your personal devotion to God.  Being in pursuit of things that will make you more proud of yourself is going after earthly things, which are not important in the long run.

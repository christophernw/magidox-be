There are two things that work well that I have tried and you Can get them at the pet store. One is called natures miracle and the other is simple solution.  I rather like the simple solution the best but neice uses the Natures Miracle in her carpet cleaner. Just refer to the labels on the bottles. Also you can give your dog a bath in the dog shampoo called Fresh and Clean. Really smells good and last a week or so they also have a spray on Fresh & Clean perfume.

My yearbook staff teacher. Man, she was a b.i.t.c.h. from hell. I almost quit the yearbook staff. She played "favorites" and put certain people on bigger assignments and in pictures for the yearbook staff page. She'd like yell at me for not doing anyhing when she wouldn't LET me do anything. Everytime I worked hard on the layout of a page she'd say so many things were wrong with it that I just wanted to start over. Geez.

What evidence do you have for such a charge against Israel?  No, they are not the most racist, Hegemonic, or aggressive power in the Middle East.  You can hear their neighbors say in their own words their will, their agenda for Israel and the rest of the world.  They want to rule the world with Islam via Sharia law.  http://judgeright.blogspot.com under the post 'In Their Own Words'  click on the BOLD words for links to videos of them saying exactly that.  As for Israel, the whole world knows that if they were not attacked on a regular basis, they would be living in peace.  They didn't steal the land as I know you will suggest next, they bought the land and the League of Nations and the United Nations voted them an area that they could sovereignty rule and at the same time voted an area for the Arab population to sovereignty rule.  The Arabs got the vast majority of the land and were not satisfied with the presence of a Jewish sovereign nation.  So they have been trying to destroy them ever since.  But wait, it didn't start there.  The Muslims have been working a varied front war for 1300 years.  The radicals have never stopped or even slowed down.  Only the crusades had any deterrent effect.  The moderates are taking over France, and have taken over Turkey, and Lebanon.  Turkey used to be a secularly ruled nation and Lebanon used to be a Christian nation.  Look at what Abadiniwhackjob said he would do.  To quote, "I would be willing to sacrifice up to 1/3 of my people if I could wipe Israel off the map."  If he does get a nuclear weapon, what on earth makes you think he won't use it to destroy Israel?

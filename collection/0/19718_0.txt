I don't know, jealousy?  How many christian denominations say they're they chosen now that?  Lots.  They seem to forget that God doesn't make promises and break them and He made  a promise to the Jews, but we want to be the chosen so we've decided since we blame the Jews for killing Christ, we'll make ourselves the chosen ones now.  It doesn't work like that, but we want to believe it, so our jealousy of them becomes anger.  Just a theory, but its all I can come up with.  We seem to forget that Christ and all the disciples were Jews.. . As for the muslims, same thing really.  Mohammed turned on the Jews and christians when we wouldn't accept him as a prophet, and the Jews just happened to be there in the mid-east, so they became the targets.

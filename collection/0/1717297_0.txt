April, get some medical grade tea tree oil, if the eye is OK that is good because that is the only place you do not want to use the oil (I have for stye's but it is not pleasant. ) It kills MRSA infections gone! As long as it is a localized infection. It worked for my son, (a long story) and 2 other people on here that have listened.

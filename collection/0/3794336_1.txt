for one thing, it's lying about the foundation of christianity and presenting made up ideas as facts. dan brown himself has said that there are things in his book which are true. what they are and aren't, however, have been communicated very unclearly, as he seems to be confused himself.. this book is making lifelong christians' faith become muddled, merely because they're misinformed. this book is trash and should be treated as such.

You dont know? Ok..... my father was into Horse races when I was young!!! They tie a band around the horses "thing" and have them drink lots of water before the race............ they go faster..... I think you would to!!!!! I saw it done as a child and asked my father.... that is what he said.... Horse races are pretty cool to watch though. So that is where the saying comes from...... "Iv got to pee like a racehorse..."

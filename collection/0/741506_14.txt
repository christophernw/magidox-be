I think that they were created because of the inherent need that man seems to have to worship something and to explain how the world could come about. Man looks around and wonders how they could possibly come here. To satisfy the explanation, man creates gods of his own imagination, gives them their attributes, and invents rituals and sacrifices meant to appease them. For every natural happening and creation, man needs to find a cause. When there is lack of technology and science, the easiest explanation is a god. A drought may occur because the rain god has not received sacrifices. An earthquake may occur because the gods are angry. An eclipse may occur because Huitzipilotchli, the Aztec sun god, hasn't received enough sacrifices to fight off the darkness, which would result in sunrise. The initial religions based on gods were simply attempts to explain natural happenings and creation of all things on the earth.. Another reason is that man seems to have the incessant need to worship something. In ancient civilizations, there have been many gods and goddesses. When thinking about it, it's a lot of work trying to appease all of these gods and goddesses and trying to live a good life. Why should they? Serving one's own desires is easier. Obeying one's feelings feels better than adhering to rules. The only possible explanation for these self-imposed restrictions is that man must have the desire to worship something. Even if one is atheist, he or she is worshipping himself by doing things that would satisfy himself or herself and attempting to commit actions that are completely to their advantage.. So, the first reason for the creation of religion is a supposedly rational explanation for creation and natural phenomena. The second reason is because man seems to have a need to worship something.

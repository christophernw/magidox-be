the melanoma thats on the surface of your dead skin cells.  when u put on a bandage, your skin gets moist under there, so when you take off the bandage the part that has the glue rips off the dead cells and shows a fresh layer.  the part that does have the glue is just still moist and hasnt had anytime to try and show the color of the cells. on black ppl ..i just dont know hehe

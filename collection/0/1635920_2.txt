The common raisins, or dried grapes, we see on supermarket shelves are usually dried Thompson seedless grapes.  Golden raisins (sultanas) are amber in color and somewhat tart--many cooks prefer them over ordinary raisins for baking and cooking.  Currants (made from the Zante grape) are about one-quarter the size of ordinary raisins, and are typically used in baked goods. Don't confuse them with the fresh sour berry that also called a currant.

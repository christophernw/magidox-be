Hammas was democratically elected. So, If we elected Charles Manson as President and he ordered murders in another country, they would have no right to act because he was elected? An elected government has licence to kill, kidnapp, or do whatever because it was elected? Israel has the right to defend itself and it's people. If the only way to do that is to forceably remove the government that continues to allow its people to terrorize Israel, than GO GET 'EM.

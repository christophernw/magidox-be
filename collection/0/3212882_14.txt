You are asking a question that should be.. How do I get rid of fleas.. People MUST remember that yes, you can treat the dog for fleas(easy) and that is to shampoo them with a GOOD flea shampoo.. or by the use of flea powder.. BUT.. The MOST IMPORTANT thing in getting rid of fleas is to spray(flea spray) the areas where the dogs sleep and where they romp and play.. Fleas are NOT JUST ON THE DOG ITSELF. but where the dog has been and ALL must be considered(taken into consideration) when getting rid of fleas... THEN.. Once it is done.. DO IT ALL OVER again in one week because by the end of a week, the flea eggs/larva will have hatched and the second spraying and dog bathing will kill the newly hatched fleas

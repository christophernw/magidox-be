He should be on a Large Breed Puppy food and you should feed him according to what the back of the bag says for his weight.      *also note, that your vet may modify the diet if he feels the pup is not growing accordingly, they (vets) should be trained to know what to look for if the pup is growing too quickly, this is why your monthly vaccine and exams during puppy-hood is VERY important*  -At about a year or a bit sooner, you can slowly turn him on to an adult dog food...make sure to adjust the measurements of food accordingly. All foods have different calorie and fat values. Also, take into consideration his activity level and amount of treats. If he has a low activity level (odd for a lab, but it is possible) decrease recommended feeding measurement. If he gets ALLOT of treats, remember they are still calories them selves, so you may have to cut back on the food.. . *also, Do NOT free feed your puppy or dog. Most dogs will eat it all in one sitting, and you will constantly be filling the bowl. This is how most animals (especially cats) get obese. Obesity effects cats and dogs in the same ways that it does humans. It is much easier to maintain a healthy weight on your pet, than it is to help them loose weight, and by that time it may be too late...Let's keep them healthy from the start!!!!

Study Mount St. Helens alone..... Look up Dr. Grady McMurtry and Creationism.  He was an evolutionist for 20 years until he was saved.  Mt. Saint Helens fossilized hundreds of acres in 8 minutes.  Scientists would tell you they were bazillions of years old.  Also, even though we are created, we are like chimps as a whole.  Ask yourself why you even believe in carbon dating.  If you really want to know the truth you will be open minded and find out.  Evolution, yes, even scientists will tell you it's still at theory, is based on a mathmatical formula that is so intellegent that you are going to be amazed.  Here it is... Stand back...Random chance + eternal time = people.  Now that is smart.  Romans 10:9 :)  Furthermore, God didn't create baby men and women, baby trees, or baby mountains in the beginning.  If you were to cut down the first trees created they would have rings inside of them that some scientists would say that it was 500 years old..  For those that hate Christians.  We still love you.  Jesus said "Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.  Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner did their fathers unto the prophets.

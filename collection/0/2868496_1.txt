With a masters, you can teach at a community college - many pay very well (NY and CA).  If you want to teach at a university, you'll probably need a Ph.D. in whatever you want to teach - most universities want to claim as many Ph.D's on staff as possible, and don't hire master's degrees to teach classes unless you can't get a higher degree in that field.

You have to have one general fact to base all of your faith on, faith being everything you believe, religious or not.. The Bible is a great thing for us to all believe in, because it appears to be the words of the one true God, whom we are trying to reach.. . Of course, there is the old joke:. Atheist: "Why do you try to please your God, when you don't even know if he exists?". Theologian: "The way I see it, if there isn't really a God, I won't get punished any worse!". . Peace out! And may God bless all those who do not know the Good News!

Infection with intestinal parasites comes from eating infected foods - such as undercooked meats (pork, beef, shellfish, freshwater fish, etc...), fruits, and vegetables.  This is why it is important to fully cook your meats, and wash your fruits and veggies.. . Humans can also get hookworms (that may end up in the intestines) from walking barefoot on soil that's been poohed on by a dog who has intestinal hookworms.  Most of the time, however, these worms die in the tissues before they reach the intestines.

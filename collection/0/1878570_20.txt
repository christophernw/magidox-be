well for something to have color it must have pigments (or something like that) to absorb light. The colors of light that aren't absorbed are reflected back to our eyes. This is like a plant. The plant absorbs all but the green waves of light and they are bounced back to our eyes. So the gas must not have enough density or something to carry these pigments to reflect it back to our eyes.

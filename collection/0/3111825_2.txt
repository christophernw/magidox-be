Good questions. There is the fact that when you multiply two negatives, you get a positive. However, two wrongs don't make a right. So we have quite a conundrum here.. . I guess it boils down to whether superstition has a multiplying effect or an addition effect.. . My take? It's all bunk anyway. You should be allright.

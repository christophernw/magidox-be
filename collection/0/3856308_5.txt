Never get a living creature for the kids unless you plan on taking care of it!!!!!  They are kids and it is hard to get kids to do anything!!!!!!!  If YOU don't have time for the puppy, find him a good home, not the pound!!!!  You teach a bad enough lesson for the kids that the pets are disposable.. . The puppy clearly doesn't get enough attention and help with the potty training.  To have made that many "messes" in the house is unreal!!!!!    Crate train him.  That may be the only option.  And have the clutter and crap cleaned up.  If there are piles of clothes, he will use them.  Puppies cannot be left alone in the house for even a min. until they are trained.  If you do not have the time, please find him a good home and get a gerbil or something.  Kids cannot be expected to take on the responsibility of a living creature.  They just aren't reliable enough.

In the Quarter finals. How.... by scoring a penalty kick against Australia, a penalty that really wasn't. Very UNFAIR for the Australians.. . In the Semi-finals. Just were a much better team than Ukraine.. . In the future is that is not going to be so easy for the against Germany! Who actually had a very competitive game against Argentina, tough opponent.. Italians... Good luck with that!

I think you probably don't understand what you are talking about because you are 12. Many blacks just act the way the do to defend themselves not because they are trying to attack people. Think about it, blacks don't label whites as colored when they are in black countries especially in Africa, instead they are cherished and loved. But it is the opposite where blacks are staying in white communities.

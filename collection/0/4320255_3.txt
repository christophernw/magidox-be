In Gregory Maguire's "Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West", Glinda is initially called "Galinda," but she drops the first 'a' in her name in the middle of the story in tribute to Doctor Dillamond, a martyred Goat who teaches at Shiz University (Doctor Dillamond made the habitual mistake of calling her "Glinda" instead of "Galinda" in class)

I mostly "go after" Christians because they're the ones that push their beliefs on me. I get tired of it... A Muslim has never tried to convert me. Neither has anyone following Wicca, Scientology, Buddhism, etc. I think most Christians have a superior attitude and feel like it's their way or no way. I know not all Christians act like that, but the majority that I've met do.

From what I understand the reason to use warm water is to activate the soap. If you try to wash your hands with soap and cold water and then soap and warm water you will notice that you get alot more suds with the warm water. Same with washing dishes. That's why most people rinse with cold water to remove the soap, warm water will activate it more.

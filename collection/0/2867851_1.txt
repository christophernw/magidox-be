I love how people(kookoo bananas) take the bible so literally. Men wrote the bible... there is a flaw. Which means they can go hand in hand.(science and the bible). The bible also mentions something about God's time being different than ours.... so the lengh on earth between day 5 and 6 for God could;ve pretty  long.. . Science proves alot. including how wonderful God and  his creations are.

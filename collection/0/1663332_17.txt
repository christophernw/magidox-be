Aside from this being the most irrational nonsensical question I have every heard. That is like asking why all blondes are dumb.. All muslims are not fanatics, all christians are not fanatics, all atheists are not fanatics. You cannot group an entire portion of people into one category based on what you hear or see in the press. Most live normal lives and are not  fanatical in any way.

DVD-R (pronounced as DVDR or DVD "Dash" R) is a DVD recordable format. A DVD-R has a larger storage capacity than a CD-R, typically 4.7 GB (or 4.38 GiB) instead of 700 MB, although the capacity of the original standard developed by Pioneer was 3.95 GB (3.68 GiB). Pioneer has also developed an 8.54 GB dual layer version, which appeared on the market in 2005.

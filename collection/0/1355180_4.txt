Honestly, prozac works different for everyone.  That goes for all medications.  For instance I was on Paxil and it made me very tired and I didn't have much energy.  Also it has withdrawl side effects when you go off it.  I was on Effexor Xr but when I found out I was having a baby I had to get off of it and I withdrew for 5 days.  I am now on Prozac and so far it seems to be working but it didn't help the anxiety for I am now on Buspar and it has started to work.  You doctor can get you on the right mix.  It just has to do with how you handle certain medications.

I remember when I learned this during a painting class. It was an epiphany for me because I never thought of it till we had an African-American model. I believe the teacher said (it was awhile ago!) to start with brown sienna and add some yellow ochre and a little bit of vermillion - a darker red. You will have to experiment. There are many different African-American complexions, so if you are trying to match the complexion of a certain person, it will take alot of experimenting. If you just want a generic skin tone then it won't be as difficult.

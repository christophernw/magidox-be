um, i like the magical marrionette. she's awesome. one time i wanted to play yugioh with sumone, but the only one around who knew how to play it didn't bring his deck. so i took out all the ritual and fusion cards and split my deck. he got the magical marrionette in his deck and slaughtered me with it.

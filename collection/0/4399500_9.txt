It is possible to carry the virus for years and never have known it.  I know, because it's been six years since I found out I had herpes and had never had a break out - ever.  I had gone in to be tested for all STD's after I left my first husband because he was having an affair (very obvious one).  The doctor said that since I never had a breakout, it is impossible to tell if I contracted herpes during that relationship or a previous one.. . As for your other questions - ask a gynecologist or any doctor who specializes in STD's.  Mabye your insurance has a 24-hour question line that you can call and ask a nurse about the questions (mine has this option).. . Any time you have a doubt or a questions ALWAYS get a second opinion.

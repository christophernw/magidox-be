It is strictly incorrect to call them Indians.  However, there are many people in Mexico whose ancestors pretty much were indigenous to Mexico.  You will find such people in Chiappas, in Yucatan and in other more remote sections of Mexico.  Look at the site of the Mexican Anthropological Museum for more information about different people in Mexico.

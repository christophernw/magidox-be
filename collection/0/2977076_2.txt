My family and I had a Cat like that once. We got the Cat when he was a Kitten. He was the runt of the litter and he did it because we took him from the mother before he could suckle on her. He did it all through his adult life too. So the kitten could do it because it was taken from the mother before it had a chance to suckle on her.

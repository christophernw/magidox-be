It is the external that we see first.  Often the person has some attribute that you prefer in the opposite sex.  Until you get a chance to sit down and talk to them, you don't have any idea beyond their looks what they are like.  I too find that often there is one or the other...getting the looks and the internal beauty is a real bonus!

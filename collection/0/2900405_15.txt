The USA didn't lose the war to Vietnam. The war was called on a count of bad feelings at home. We were doing the majority of the fighting, over a treaty that we didn't even sign. We only got into the war because our allies ask us to back them up. But as usual, we got stuck holding the bag while our allies sat in the back ground. We didn't go into the war to win it, only as back up. Then the CIA started making so much money off of running drugs that they didn't want it to end. We could have easily won it, had that been the plan. Unlike any other country in the world, we try not to create too many civilian casualties and yet we're the ones who get the most flack when it happens. Usually by those who do it on purpose.

The price of the gas that you pay is decided by the individual that owns the gas station.  He/she has already purchased the gas (a whole truckload of it) from the parent company at a set price.  How much he/she charges for it is a tradeoff between how much money they can make, vs. how high a price will cause people to not come there to fill up.

Society is in denial about the reality of this situation.. . To me, sex slavery is the worst most abdominal thing I can imagine <yes, worse than canabolizm>. My little giraffe brain does not understand how to help a person who was sold by their own mother to have sex at the age of 2 years old...THEIR OWN MOTHER!!!  So, then I get stuck thinking bad mother, bad mother . . . then I relax and realize that the mother was sold into sex slavery from her mother or sister brother, or she was stolen ... it's a vicious cycle that transends all logic that I have encountered.. . I am unclear where a sex slaves human dignity ends or begins.  I do pray ...Actually, I bellow at the top of my lungs the song, "Ave Maria" when I think about this subject.  It's so sad and overwhelming, I can only hope that my really bad singing reaches the Holy Mary and she ask her son Jesus to help these women ... I'm clueless on how to focus my mind, let alone help!!!  Save us Jesus!!!

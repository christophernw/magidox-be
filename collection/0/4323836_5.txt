interesting that you would consider other religions "made-up" but your own, christianity, is original and true. what makes you think that christianity wasn't made up either? do you know who wrote the bible? how do you know it is the truth? human beings invented religion and god/s when our brains evolved the ability to remember the past and imagine the future. we became aware of our own inevitable deaths, and became painfully and anxiously aware of our own ignorance. to resolve the stress that this created we invented omniscient and omnipotent gods and deities that would care for us and maybe even grant us life after death! . of course your question seems to be directed more at the recent history of christianity in the west... generally speaking all of these christian denominations (and some non-christian ones too) splintered off because they didn't completely agree with the teachings of religions at the time and thought their ideas were better (a little conceited maybe, but it happens).

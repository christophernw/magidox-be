The reason that LCM in the rationals is not defined is the same reason that GCD and prime numbers in the rationals are not defined.  Every non-zero number in the rationals is a unit.  This means that for every number n/m that you can find in the rationals, there is also the number m/n in the rationals, and n/m*m/n=1.. . Why does this make a difference?. . Let's look at the LCM of a number dealing with integers:. . the LCM(a,b,c,d)=m.  This means that m is the smallest non-zero number such that a,b,c, and d divide m.  Thus there exists integers u,v,x,y such that m=au=bv=cx=dy, and m is the smallest integer that you can do this with.. . Now consider rational (non-zero) numbers s,t.  Then 1/s, 1/t are also rational numbers.  Thus 1/s*s+1/t*t=1, therefore s,t divide 1.  But 1/(ns) and 1/(nt) are also rational numbers, and 1(ns)*s=1(nt)*t=1/n for any n>0, thus s,t divide 1/n for any n>0.  This states that we can make 1/n as small as possible.  Since the LCM is greater than zero, and 1/n-->0 as n-->infinity, the LCM is not defined.. . I hope this makes since, if not please message me to clarify.. . . Ohh, and don't listen to EasternStar; not only is she rude, but she is also wrong.  A rational number is a number that CAN be written as a ratio of integers.  1.2 can be written as 6/5 and is thus a rational number.  I'm surprised you teacher didn't teach you that in 7th year when you were learning about LCM and rational numbers.

My Siamese does this sometimes if I move my hand too quickly around his face while laying on my lap-even though I have never mistreated him in all his life.. It might be reacting like you would if someone suddenly put their hand in your face...defence reaction.. But unfortunately it may have been abused before so all I can say is be patient, talk soothingly to her and give her lots of cuddles and kisses.

No accountability.  It's state-run, and there are laws and agreements that make it difficult to get rid of bad teachers.  Also, there is not enough supervision of how schools spend their money.  With the new MCAS stuff, it's both better and worse - kids are learning, but they spend a lot of time just learning how to take the test!  States know that there are few places that we can send our kids to, so they don't have much incentive to improve (where else can we go?)  Home-schooling isn't an option usually - if I'm a truck-driver or something, and my kid wants to be a molecular biologist, how am I supposed to teach that at home?

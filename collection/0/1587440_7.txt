The land called the "Philippines" is really an arbitrary name given by the English to distinguish thier colonies in "Indonesia" with that of the Dutch. In both cases the people within those lands shared no common ancestry or cultural history. As I said the name of the lands were developed by Western colonial powers for thier purposes alone, not because the people included saw themselves as one homogeneous group. In fact that was rarely the case. This is also why you see a strangely straight line between Indonisia and New Guinea. The people on either side of this line are not different from eachother, the line was merely the result of a negotiation between the Dutch and England.

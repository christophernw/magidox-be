I actually broke both my ankles. One I broke sliding into 3rd plate playing softball. The plate wasnt on properly and when I went to slide into it I caught the plate and it broke my ankle. Second one I broke playing basketball. I went up for a rebound and came down and someone landed on my ankle. They still act up on me sometimes.

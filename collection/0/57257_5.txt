Sadly there are those who would interpret certain passages that give them god's grace to "suffer little children to come unto me" or perhaps they've read the story of Lot and believe it is god's covenant that daughter's be available for father's procreation needs.  It only takes one tiny turn of biblical phrase to make it god's will.  Then there are the Catholics that have brought the shame on themselves for advocating celibacy which is a major sin against nature. That is why some pervs hide behind the church.

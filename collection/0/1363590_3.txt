Well, I've noticed that some filipinos have a similar accents to some Spanish people I know. Mainly due to the fact that there are a lot of Spanish words in the filipino (tagalog) dialect and the grammar is similar.. . English: How are you?. Spanish: como estas?. Tagalog: kumusta?. . Sounds similar right?

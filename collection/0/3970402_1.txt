The best thing u can do is try to get a manual on the 1992 ford explorer if u are experienced in motor vechile mechanics... if u aint then i would advise that u leave ur vechile well alone as u can do more damage than enough which means that u will have to fork out more money... if u feel that the auto centre that u brought it to is charging too much then shop around and get prices and make sure who u bring it to is fully qualified to sort the problem.. i done mechanics and know how easy it is to cause unnoticeable damage to any vechile.... the slave cylinder is part of the clutch... there is full clutch kits that u can buy if that is a help, otherwise i cant help anymore as i have never worked on a ford explorer. hope this helps. God bless

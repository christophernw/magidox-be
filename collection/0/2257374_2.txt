Lead has a very low melting point compared to other metals.  I'm not sure of the exact temperature at which it will melt, but we'll use some other numbers.  Say you have aluminum and lead, the lead would melt at 200 degrees F, while the aluminum would take up to 500 degrees F to actually melt.  Every metal has a different melting point, which is just basically the heat needed to turn it to liquid.

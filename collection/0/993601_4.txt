I am assuming you are referring to abuse by white men.  Although slavery was abolished, we were still treated like slaves for a long period of time.  Many slaves ended up "working" for there original masters.  Within this arrangement many of the women were probably abused and raped as if they were still slaves.  It wasn't a big deal back then for slave masters to impregnate young black women.

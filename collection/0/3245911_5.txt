"CUT AND RUN" was sooo like,, 5 minutes ago.. is this just some Republican bashing? I vote based on the research I do over every candidate, and Amendment presented on my ballot. Here's some procedure for ya,, instead of bashing! If you registered to vote you should have received a sample ballot last week or the week before, outlining the candidates and the actual ballot. You can check your local paper, my jurisdiction's candidates were featured in this past Sunday's paper. You can get that at the library. Also included with your ballot might be a profile page, which is merely a synopsis of why you should vote for them, based on their action/platform; keep in mind, they have written it to persuade your vote. You can be either a Republican or a Democrat or be of Non Party Affiliation. Either way, you can vote however, you want, for Amendments and candidates, or write in your choice. Your local news might have an Election 2006 link on their website that has profiles and shows opposition and favor for those running in your county, state, as they differ from every ones. . It would take too long to explain the different views that make up either Party and the GOP.. and offer you synopsis about the power of the government and how it relates to a preponderance of a certain party in power. This should get you started, with a fair and informative approach to voting. Good luck!

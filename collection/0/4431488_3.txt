I agree with tallhwch, religion and beliefs DO influence everyday life, sometimes in small ways and sometimes in major ways.. Examples:. small ways - Cultures will eat certain foods or refrain from certain foods due to religious beliefs. Sometimes year round sometimes just in certain parts of the year. This will influence what crops are grown or what domestic animals are kept and raised for food. Look at the Jews, they do not eat pork, so they don't raise pigs. No pig farmers, no pigs to eat scrapped foods and vegetable material, no pigs foraging through woodlands loosening soil in their search for edible roots etc.. big-ways - any time a conquering nation, tribe, or group conquers another, their religious beliefs are forced onto the conquered. When any group rises in strength and becomes stronger than others, then they assume their way is the 'right' way to believe/behave. Consequently one of the first things they do is force, or try to force, the conquered into becoming/behaving/believing just like they do to 'save them from their folly'. Look at the American Indians when the Europeans came over. One of the first things the whites did was to 'civilize' the Indians, even though many Indian cultures were older than theirs and had established trade across the entire continent.. So, yes, in a nutshell, religions and beliefs DO influence cultures which in turn influences civilization.

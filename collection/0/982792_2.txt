Don't bind yourself to the religion.  The religion was created by people, who (as you've seen above) are fallible and often make mistakes.  We are driven by our own ambitions and our own goals.. . Instead, bind yourself to the person behind the Religion.  Take a look at the Bible with an open mind.  Don't read it with the preconceived notions that society gives us.  Read it like you would any other book, and you'll find that the Religion that is practised in most places today isn't actually Christianity...

drag the crates to one end of the see saw that faces the wall, does not have to be all the way on, just a bit is fine.  Now go over to the high ledge that's facing the doorway that you are trying to open and jump off the ledge onto the opposite side of the seesaw that has the crate on it.  you will catapult the crates onto floor where you can drag them onto the buttons on the floor.  hope that helps...

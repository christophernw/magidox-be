Why go on eating after you've had the most delicious meal in your life?  There is always more.. . On another point, most people with wealth know that their worth is only as powerful or as valuable as others see fit to recognize.  Their stocks could crash, their $10 million dollar home might crumble in a land slide, burn in a fire, devaluate when a liquor store opens down the street (ok, that was a bit of a stretch....but you know).  These people do not have gold reserves, I can assure you.

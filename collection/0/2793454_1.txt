It sad how many people on here no nothing about diabetes yet give all kinds of bad information.. . As a type two you aren't on shots so you can't "just take insulin".  What you really need to do is get referred to a specialist many type II's don't see one because they really don't know that they can so you need to see an Endocrinologist.  They will then refer you to a dietitian.  Unfortunately many General Practitioners try to treat their diabetic patients themselves but really don't have the extensive training they need to do a good job of it.. . As for now when you sugars are high you cannot eat until you get your levels down.  You need to do some physical activity like walking, running, sports it needs to be an aerobic activity so no lifting weights :).. . I hope this help.. Please go see a dietitian who can get you on your way.. . BTW .. Type II or I is not caused by eating white flour and sugar.  Type II can be caused by obesity and those things can contribute but so can eating too much fat and red meats etc.

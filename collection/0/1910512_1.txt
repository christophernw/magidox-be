I am thinking that you are asking this question in the religion department because you don't want to medicate.. . The best answer I can give you about overcoming depression without medication is volunteer..work with the developmentally disabled, the mentally retarded, the old and infirm in the nursing homes, the children in the orphanages, the homeless in the shelters, and the hungry at the soup kitchens.... . I guarentee when you begin looking to the needs of others instead of focusing on your own problems, you will see that your problems may not be so bad as what you perceive them to be.. . GOD saves us to serve, and we serve to save.

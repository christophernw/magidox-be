Check the wiring to be sure you have all good connections....check to make sure you have the proper voltage/amps for the HID bulb you are running...Could be overloaded. Most likely need to replace the ballast all together. Check the amps/volts with a meter to make sure the ballast is actually not getting power first...If it is getting power but continues to fail to ignite, you may be overloading it.. What are you growing with that lamp? Just kidding.....

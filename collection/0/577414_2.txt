ignorant means that they don't know things ,uneducated means they need to learn.. And that is exactly why they are the ones who ask the most questions,. isn't that what answers is all about ,. where has  your informative spirit gone the urge to be help full ,to try and make a difference.. if these people were not here there would be a lot less to answer to.. but I do agree ,that to use the check spelling should be compulsory ,if only so that we would know ,what the F**k some of the people were on about, some of the time,although it does open the door for a chance to be sarcastic.

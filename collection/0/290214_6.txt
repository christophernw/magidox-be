It depends upon WHERE he's bleeding from.. . If it's from his urinary tract you need to get him to a vet FAST!!! If it's from someplace on his body, he's probably been fighting and has sustained wounds that need to be tended to in order to prevent infection.. . I sincerely hope he is neutered. Neutered cats aren't as territorial as 'whole' cats so they don't fight as much. . . You should really keep him as an INDOOR ONLY pet to keep him safe and allow him a long life.

Hi, I went through what you are going through.  I got my BS degree.  Each scholarship or Grant is different.  Some will hold the money and give it out to you when you need it, you may have to provide receipts for books and stuff.  Most scholarships and Grants give you the lump sum or payments spread over the semester/year.  You can find out by asking the admissions office at your school.  One that I received was given to me in a lump sum.  The last one I receive I got $600 a month.  You don't have to claim these on your taxes.  In fact as a student you can claim all the tuition or books or bills you pay and you can claim all your medical.  You can also receive medical insurance through your school if you don't have any.  I would also suggest going on google or yahoo search engines and look for more scholarships and grants.  You can have more than one at a time.

I know it's hard, they ask for experience but no-one is willing to to give it! I was fortunate because my dad hooked me up with a firm of solicitors because he knew the boss, that's how I got my experience and the same goes for others that I know, they gained experience through contacts. I would suggest:. . 1. You try and speak to friends and relatives that may be able to help you out, sometimes it's who you know and not what you know. . 2. Bombard companies with your CV, just blitz every place you can think of with your application, if you don't try you don't know!. . 3. Offer your services on a voluntary basis, I know working for no money is a pain but at least you will have something on your CV by way of experience and it is more likely to get you a paid job quick as opposed to constant failed applications. Always remember that experience is the key, employers always look for this because the less they have to train you the better it is for them. . . You don't specify what sort of work you're looking for but I'm sure the above approaches are applicable. . . Good luck and I hope something turns up soon, I know it's difficult when you can't secure employment so I know where you're coming from!

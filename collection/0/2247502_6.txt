Nobody should be rude about anything, but the truth is, some people are. Sometimes the rudeness could come from feeling stupid for not knowing the answers; more often, I would suspect that people think that the questions being ask are for the answers rather than help getting to the answers. The reason for homework is to give the student a learning exercise. We take that away when we just hand out answers. If questions were ask in a way that helped the student learn rather than to just give the answer, the people answering may tend to be more tolerable.

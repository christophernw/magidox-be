There is history of peoples in time that tell what they did and facts like that.  There also is history kept in Glastonbury England about Joseph, Jesus uncle that was a wealthy tin man that had tin mines there.  The story of the history there says that this man often traveled by boat with his nephew, Jesus when Jesus was a younger boy.  Joseph was kinsman redeemer to Jesus and it was Joseph who offered the tomb for Jesus and the fine linen they covered Jesus in. Like all children, Jesus basically grew and learned and spent time with relatives and family.  There is a book called Traditions of Glastonbury written by Raymond Capp..(not sure of spelling) that is about this.

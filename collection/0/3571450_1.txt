stocks splis usually occurs when the price gets relatively high and the board of directors then decides to split it. The shareholder does not get to vote on stock split, however.  Only the member of the boards gets to decide in closed door.  It is important to keep in mind stock splits means there are much more shares outstanding, thus decreasing the value of the share.

We don't know they are all different for sure, but the statistical likelyhood of any two being the same are very small.. . Ice crystals form in several ways, and the structure is extremely sensitive to humidity and temperature, which is slightly different in different parts of the cloud. Then snowflakes can hit each other and fragment, or stick together. So, you see, so much happens that it would be rare to see two that look exactly the same.

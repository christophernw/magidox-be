chem equation. . 2Fe + H + 3OH >< Fe2O3 + 2H2. . the oxidation process does not create a basic solution, however, it will decrease the acidity of the solution to some point near neutral.. . A hydroxyl (OH-1) molecule would need to be present to create a basic solution and none exisit in the formula above or for any metal oxide.. . The byproduct of metal + acid will be H2 and heat.. . H2 by the way is a gas and will bubble out of the soultion at std atmosphere.

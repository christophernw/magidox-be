Part of the reason is, of course, the emotions involved with some issues.  For example, the images of 9/11 in a new textbook could still cause some people a great amount of grief.. . Another reason is that it is too hard to tell what the impacts of recent events will be.  For example, take the war in Iraq.  While today it is a major issue, in may not be say, if our country were to invade Iran.  While we know what the effects of World War II were, we don't know what the long-term effects of the war in Iraq will be.  So as not to seem as soothsayers, the makers of text books will simply gloss over the recent past.

If you are trying to see Sweden after the 31st of March 2007, you should take a train to Basle, then take the CityNightLine night train to Copenhagen and then take the X2 to Stockholm. It is better to get to Finland via Ferry. To get to Germany, fly in economy for a lower price to Berlin. From Berlin you can then take, a no-changes train directly to Prague

I could ask the same question about Teddy Kennedy for all of his remarks. Maybe he was trying to make a joke like John Kerry and no one got the punch line. IF I lived in MA I'd move just because of who the Sentors are! It wasn't racial the remark Charlie Rangle made about Mississippi but it sure was offensive to folks that live there.. . Is it only a bad thing when Republicans make remarks that offend people. Democrats do it all the time.

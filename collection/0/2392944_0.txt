The word Window originates from the Old Norse vindauga, from vindr "wind" and auga "eye." It is first recorded in the early 13th century, and originally referred to an unglazed hole in a roof.. . When you consider its origin, it is pretty easy to understand why it was called a window. Maybe you two can let it rest now.

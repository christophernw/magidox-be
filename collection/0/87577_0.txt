Roundworms are gotten either before birth from the mother, from eating other dogs' feces, or eating the feces of a wild animal that carries roundworms, like a racoon.  Take a FRESH fecal sample to your vet, and they can look at it under a microscope for evidence of roundworm eggs.  Roundworms are fairly easy to treat- the dog will just need an oral medication.. . Fleas can cause tapeworm infections, but that's a totally different parasite, and will require a different medication to treat it.

don't give her a flea bath b/c of the chemicals. you'll just have to give her a regular bath maybe with a flea begone shampoo b/c what they use in pet stores is way stronger and meant to kill just the fleas. using just reg. shampoo will lessen the chance of the strong chem. traveling through the circulatory system affecting the puppies. that's what i'd do.

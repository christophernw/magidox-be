Well a trip to the vet is best, but if you have to wait until pay day, you can try bathing with tea tree shampoo.  Also a white thick fluid called benzyl benzoate dabbed on around the effected areas might help as well.  It has no smell, must cools irritated skin and it kills of alot of bugs.  That will help ease the discomfort until payday.  But as they suck on blood, it will have a debilitating effect on your dog.  Go to the vet as soon as you can.   Good luck.

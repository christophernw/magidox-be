i think you've got some terminology mixed up here. chakras are points on yuor body that are supposed to be centres of spiritual energy. They correspond to nerves or glands and this makes them extremely vulnerable, all of your chakra points correspond to somewhere that if struck can be extremely painful or fatal. So i don't think they can be used to defend yourself.

I'm not gonna list everything but I believe the real reason is that the government has too many benefits by keeping it out of the mainstream. There are people paid off with huge sums of money daily to deal drugs and stay out of jail. By leagalizing it that money would just go into the hands of the Pot Brownie shop owners and such.. . It is totally irrational to me that it is illegal.

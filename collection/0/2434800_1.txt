Hey, I am an Executive Assistant (secretary is kind of "old school")!. . I do a lot more than my nails, and I certainly don't look good in a low-cut dress :-)  I also don't get coffee (you want coffee?  Get out of your leather chair and get it yourself).. . Seriously, though, I do a lot.  Most of my time is taken up with email, correcting office politics between the "regular" admins.  I coordinate just about everything that goes on in the department, set up meetings, travel arrangements, and attend endless meetings that seem to have no purpose except to say "I have a meeting".  I supervise 12 people (not including the "boss").. . On top of that, I am responsible for the department budget of nearly $1.5 million per year, all of the office supplies, housekeeping contractors, all of the computers, fax machines, copiers, schedules for 4 managers, many volunteers and have to coordinate all of the publications that go out the door.. . And if that isn't enough, I am expected to know the phone number and what is on the local take-out menu for every restaurant within a 5 mile radius so I can have lunch here in 20 minutes.. . (While all of this is true, I hope you read this with the humor that it was intended)

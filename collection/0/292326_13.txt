Why does everyone think on terms of purifying by exile ?. All that does move the problem, not remove it. This kind of thinking is as dangerous as any other nonproductive hate and fear based group's philosophy.  Hitler would probably think now, as he did then, that Americans were a mongerelized people, I'm sure even he knew there is no such thing as an American race. . . P.S. Don't use big words you haven't looked up, it makes you look like a big oxy moron !

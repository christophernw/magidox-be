By counting the reveloutions of either a mark or permament magnet that is typically connected to the transmission. There are several componets to this system but I am only explaining the basic operation here. This is why your speedometer and odometer will register incorrect information if the diameter of your tires change. Putting larger diameter tires on your car/truck will result in the speedometer displaying a slower speed that your actually traveling. Likewise, the odometer registers fewer miles traveled.

Honey you cannot become straight just as someone cannot become gay.  If you are having issues dealing with your sexual preference please seek out the help of a counselor.  you can find one through your local Mental health office in your town.  Good luck and don't for one second think you are less of a person becuase you are gay. You are loved just the way you are.

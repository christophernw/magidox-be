It sounds more like a psychological problem than anything else.   2 years ago I had a cockateil who was doing exactly the same.   He started pulling all his tail feathers out until there was nothing left.   Even when he preened it was with aggession.    He had a happy enough environment but all my other birds were rosellas and he didn't have a mate.    We got him a female, and from that point it stopped.. . On the other hand, your budgie seems to be gnawing at a wound.   You should get this wound checked out.    If there is no vet available you should spray the wound with an antiseptic (one that is safe for birds). . . If any of my birds cut themselves I use Betaisodona which is a dry powder spray.  It's easy to spray on, contains antiseptic, it's safe in small doses and tastes so vile that the bird will only put its beak to it once.

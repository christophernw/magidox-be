My ex-husband was Mormon, as was his whole family.  The mormons do not drink alcohol, caffeine, etc.  It's because they believe that you do not ingest anything that is unhealthy for you.  So they also would not smoke, or things like that.  They believe that "your body is a temple" and that you should take care of it.

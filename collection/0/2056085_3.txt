Legalism is an early stage in spiritual growth. A stage that many people do not grow beyond. . . Jesus kept trying to pull the priests and pharisees out of their legalism.. . These legalistic believers mean well and can be trying but don't let them hole you back from your own growth.. . With love in Christ.

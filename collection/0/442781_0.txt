Depending on your age this could be a very good question. By the time you are 18 years of age you should be familiar with many laws and those most commonly violated. Of course there are laws in every state that are so absurd legal scholars cannot know them all.  Do not steal, drink, use drugs, DO obey all traffic laws and if you do not know them get a book from your Secretary of State and learn them. Based on my experience if you are ever arrested or charged with violating some little known or misunderstood law a Judge will usually hear your explanation and dismiss the charges. Try to be a good person and treat others as you would like to be treated and I do not think you will ever be charged with violating any laws.

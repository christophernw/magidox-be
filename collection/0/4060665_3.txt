The early church began baptizing infants because of the idea that children are born in sin and need immediate baptism to ensure their salvation.This view is based on the misunderstanding that baptism in and of itself conveys salvation. However, if there is no accompanying faith, baptism is null and void. "He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved" (Mark 16:16). What is needed is that when a baby comes to the age of accountability, he or she make a life changing and saving confession of Christ.

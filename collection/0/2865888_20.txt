Democrats prefer a large government to fund the many social programs they support.  Things like welfare, social security etc.. . Republicans feel that, to quote Thomas Paine, "The government which governs best, is the government that governs least."  They feel that people are able to take care of things on their own, such as saving for retirement, and don't need the government to hold their hand through the process.. .

I agree with some of the other answers, we are bored and it's relaxing... I like to read the nutrition info on the item I am eating at that time. I don't really think it is a good Idea though I think we should be concentrating on what we are eating (it's more satisfying). Instead of eating mindlessly... I seem to forget that I ate anything (Because I am usually on-line with a plate or bowl in front of me)

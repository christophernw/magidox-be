i've  always known since i was younger too.  ive always been drawn to  girls , always  finding my self  staring at girls  .  it could  be  a room  full of  sexy model type males and  one  girl comes in  i  would  ignore the guys and pay attention to that one girl. i have  gone  out with guys just to get close to  their  sisters.  i would  always be in  denial though. but now im like  i might miss my  soulmate and my one true love  just because im  denieying myself.but  i  dont care anymore

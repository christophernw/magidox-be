there are two leading theories on how the expression "dead as a doornail" came about:. . the first is that the doornail in question was the plate or knob that the knocker rested on. this poor nail would have had its life bashed out of it by visitors and their repeated rapping.. . but, because nails were never live to begin with, the explanation that carpenters use seems more likely to me. a "dead" nail is one that has been pounded through wood and has had its tip bent over so that it can't be used again.

Religious belief - faith - is the ability to believe something you know to be untrue.  And the more sure you are that it is untrue, the stronger must be your faith.. BUT - is it possible to believe there is no higher power : that all the wonderful things we see around us - including George Bush - are mere accidents of evolution?  Of course not!  But perhaps that's as far as we can, or need to go.

Between 8-10 wks is a good age to bring a doberman pup home. Vets "usually" crop ears between 9-11 wks.. Yes, I am Pro-crop.... and my granddaughter's ears are pierced too.. . www.dpca.org   they have breeder referrals    . . Beware of the breeders that sell pups for $250-$400  Beware of any breeders that have pups available at any given time.  . . If a breeder is selling pups with ears cropped for $600 -$700... you're actually only paying about $250-$350 for the pup. You get what you pay for.. I've seen some sell dobe pups for $800 with ears cropped & shipping included..... break that down... . Ears $350 (in FL) . Shipping $250 ..... . leaves $200 for the pup........ not a good choice!. . You are welcome to email me directly.. . llana: i guess you have no idea what goes into raising a doberman litter. Not counting everything before even breeding, or up to the time of ear cropping, Ear cropping alone runs $350 in my area.

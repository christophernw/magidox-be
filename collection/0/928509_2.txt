I'm here for you!. . Pol Pot was educated in France. He took the ideas of Rousseau, Jean-Jacques (1712-1788) seriously, particularly the Nobel Savage stuff. He instituted it, slaughtering 1/2 the population. Ah France.. . Pot croaked a few years back, probably w/o enough pain.. . Why the impunity? I can guess:. The west has degenerated into an unsure state, not certain of any morality, and is therefore paralyzed to attack any anti-life ideology w/o some form of “world community” buy-in.. . The US is/was snake-bitten on Vietnam, and – again – paralyzed to act.

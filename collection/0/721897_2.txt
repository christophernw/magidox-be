i have had two sets of leather sofa's in my house, the first set did get all scratched up by my cats before i got them de-clawed. they just looked terrible, and i always had scratching posts for them but they preferred the sofa's instead.. you can cover them up but they're leather so of course you're going to want to show it off. (as in my case). so, the only thing i can suggest is to de-claw, it's really not cruel like some people say (my cats are only front de-clawed)  it will save you your couches, curtains and a bunch of heartache.

We live because membranes evolved into complex cells, and amino acids evolved into complex structures inside the cells, and this weird combination of elements accidentally found a way to consume stuff, discard stuff, and then create a new one of itself before it breaks down and dies.. . We die because the human cell only has a certain number of times that it can replicate without starting the path to breaking down.. . There's no other reason.  It just happened because it could.

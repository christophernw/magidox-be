Apparently, tarot cards were not always used to tell peoples fortunes – they originally made up a game called tarocchi which was popular with the Italian nobility in the 15th century.  Tarocchi was played much like bridge or whist, except that there was a 5th suit of cards that trumped all the other suits.  The earliest reported use of tarot cards in fortune telling is in Venice, Italy in 1527, but the fad didn’t take off until 1781 when a French scholar proposed that cards in the deck contained the knowledge of the Egyptian hieroglyphic book The Book of Thoth, which he claimed had been saved from the ruins of sacked and burned Egyptian temples centuries earlier.

If the plane were going down, I'd be happy to wait until it were low enough to jump out safely.. . One reason why no parachutes are provided, is that if the cabin decompressed, and someone was stupid enough to open their parachute when still inside the plane, the chute could open behind the plane.... . 535mph to 100mph in ten seconds!. . Maybe one big parachute COULD be designed into future aircraft - have to be a big one though.. . I can here Homer saying something in the background at this point..

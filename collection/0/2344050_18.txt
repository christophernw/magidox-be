There might be an evolutionary psychological element in the attraction of some men to older women. That is because the sexual anatomy of males reaches full functional maturity at an earlier age than females. A woman may still be able to reproduce in her mid-teens, but her hips are not likely to be of the maximum possible width to allow babies to pass through, whereas men only need semen to reproduce, and semen is typically first produced around the age of 13. Therefore, in our ancient past when our lifespans were shorter, young teenage males that were attracted to, and reproduced with, older females, had a better chance of producing fit offspring. The attraction of men older than their teenage years to older women may in some cases be a side-effect of that.

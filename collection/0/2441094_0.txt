The safest way is to get some industrial-grade heavy duty polymer (plastic) sheeting and cut it to the length you desire. (The last one that I did was about 50 ft. long and went down a hill.)  Then, ideally you would have a couple of garden hoses running on it, so that you can keep the thing slippery enough.  Most importantly, don't try to coat it with oil or soap-VERY dangerous-you go way too fast.  Have fun and be careful!

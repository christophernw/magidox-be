So, you need to find the length of one of the sides, which we can do.  From the short base, go to either end of it and draw a straight line to the longer base.  This makes a right triangle with a height of 9, and an adjacent side of (32 - 6) = 26 / 2 = 13 meters.. . You can now use Pythagorean's Theorem to find the "hypotenuse", which is one of the sides of the trapezoid.  The square root of (13 squared) + (9 squared) is 15.811 meters.  This is the length of one of the sides.. . Now to find the perimeter, add (32 + 6 + 15.811 + 15.811) = 69.622, which is, to the whole number, about 70 meters.

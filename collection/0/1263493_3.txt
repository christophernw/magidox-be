it was a seldom used process that this president has abused but then again he abuses everything he is allowed to touch or be "in charge" of because if he screws it up and if you check out his past he ALWAYS screws things up someone else gets to clean up his mess. It must be nice to be a rich spoiled brat even in your 50s & 60s and just be clueless to taking responsibility

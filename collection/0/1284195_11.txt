The Sabbath is not Sunday.  Sabbath is the seventh day...the day of rest...The Bible never makes mention of the day "sunday."  The Sabbath is a time of reflection and giving to God your mind and heart...a time of devotion to God.  The rest of the time we are to be serving the Community of Christ in our friends, neighbors and strangers, but we still must give time to devote to God instead of our own personal endeavors.  So literally you are able to hold "Sabbath" any time you use as devotional to God   . . There is an interesting discussion of the Sabbath in Bill Moyer's book  "Genisis"  Take a peek. .  . There is a large population of individuals using "Church" and doctrine and bumper-sticker theology to look the part of a Christian while never devoting their spirit to Christ.  These folks, though with tongue say they keep the Sabbath, do not, for they are keeping it for show and, in turn, their own personal endeavors....thus, of course, breaking the Sabbath, but a man who works everyday of the week, yet takes time to devote to God --be it ten minutes or two minutes, is quietly and quite devoutly keeping the Sabbath.

Hetero marriage is respected under the law because it is a fundamental institution that makes society possible. Marriage laws, at the core, are to protect the weaker sex. . . We aren't all of a sudden saying that gay stuff is bad. It has always been an abomination to the Lord. Read Dueteronomy ... adulterers and homosexuals were to be taken out and stoned. Yes, they are hurting a lot of people ... themselves, each other, and causing weakness and confusion in the general population. If our society were really attacked by an enemy who had the ability to destroy us with force, like the Nazis could have done, questions like personal sexual preferences would be irrelevant. Protecting your basic family unit ... that is all that would matter. . . The extreme moslems who threaten us now believe we are the great satan because of our tolerance for homosexuals, among other things. They see it as a weakness. I'm not saying God will send all the gays to hell. To the contrary, God loves us all and wants to find a way to save us. Every gay man I've met tells me he thinks he was born that way. Every man I've met who is straight but used to be gay (a convert?) tells me that he thought he was born gay until he came to understand the real reasons for his unhappiness in life.. . There is a law of unintended consequences. Our amazing society was not an accident. It takes an amazing amount of effort and dedication to keep it going. We're doing pretty good and can certainly tolerate a lot of deviance, but I wonder where the point is that we are rotting from the core and will become a society that is studied as ancient history by future generations. We are already studying western Europe that way.

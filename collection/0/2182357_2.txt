oh yeah, do you think they would have time to vote?  no they would be to busy enjoying their federal holiday.. and i find it really easy to vote.  the polls open at 7:00 am i can go on my way to work.  i may have to get up a little bit earlier. oh yeah i can mail in my ballot early before elections.. how hard is that to do?  you have months to make that decision and put it in the mail.  i can go after work.  the problem isn't with the ease or dis-ease of voting it is in the hearts and minds of the voters.  it is called priorities and being responsible as a citizen and putting that first before your self entertainment lifestyle.

I would see a doctor asap.  I would also recommend taking a  home pregnancy test today.  If you are under a lot of stress or are extremely physically active your body might stop having periods.  Also, if you are on birth control check what type you are on.  If you don't take the placebo pills and just keep taking the ones with hormones it will trick your body into thinking it's pregnant and prevent you from having a period.

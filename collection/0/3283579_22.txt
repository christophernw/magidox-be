this again , it's not that anyone is afraid, it's that it is a lie . they can call it fiction , but the term fiction is just a nice way to say LIE. and there will be KIDS ( do you and everyone else that ask this question see the word KIDS) see this Lie (movie) and be confused and may believe the lie. yes I know that most people now days could careless what kids watch ,hear ,or even do, but some of us still do.

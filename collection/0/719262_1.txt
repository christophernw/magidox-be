You can't prevent the cream from rising to the top. The old antique milk bottles had a bulbous neck to collect the cream and cream spoons were used to skim it off for use in other things. I suggest that if you put the boiled milk in a tall, slender pitcher it would be easy to remove it. After the excess is gone you won't have as much of a problem with the skin. If you don't want the cream you will have to buy skim milk in the store. My grandma used to add a little butter to our cups of hot milk and that seemed to help keep the skin from forming long enough to drink it.

Which theory: special relativity or general relativity?  They are two distinct yet related theories.  This forum is too small to answer completely.  Google or yahoo! for einstein and relativity and you should get some great results.. Special relativity deals with the only absolute being space-time, as both space and time individually ar not absolute.  The famous equation E=mc^2 is a result of this.  c means the constant value of the speed of light in a vacuum.  Here's the problem..... Imagine going along in a moving car at say 50mph.  Now, throw a ball from back seat to front seat at 5 mph.  Now to you inside the frame of reference being the car, the ball is moving away at 5mph.  No problem there.  To someone standing onthe3 side of the road, the ball goes by them at 55 mph ( 50mph speed of car added to 5mph speed of thrown ball.)  Again, no problem.  And, BOTH these measurements are completely correct.  It is just relative to the observer and their frame of reference.  Now, imagine turning on a flashlight.  A photon of the light will go away from you at c or the speed of light.  You would measure it that way.  To that same oberserver you are driving by it will also be c or the speed of light, not the c plus the car's speed.  And, both measurements would be completely correct.  So, if the equation for speed is s=d/t (or speed equals distance divided by time), and the speed in this case (of light) is a constant--which it is--, then the variables must be distance and time.  When moving at or very close to the speed of light, time and distance are relatvie to the observer in motion.  The only absolute immutable frame of reference is space-time.  . general relatvity was einstein's way of incorporating gravity into his theory.  The effect of gravity is the same as the effect of accelerated motion.  Bearing in mind the true deifinition of acceleration being a change in velocity.

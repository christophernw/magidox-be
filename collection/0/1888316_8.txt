Priests and nuns have made this choice of their own.  There is not scripture that says a minister of God is to not marry.  Paul said it would be better not to marry because one could devote more time to God instead of family matters, BUT he also said if a person couldn't keep themselves from sex outside of marriage, they should marry.  It's better to marry than to burn.  Nowhere is it forbidden to marry.

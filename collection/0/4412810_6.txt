i dont believe in gyms if ur sincere about ur body u can also do it at home.. dont eat heavy. eat light food like boiled beans, eggs, beetroots. try to drink juice. exwrcise properly 4 atleast 1 hr. do not pain ur body. start slowly. remember off the fan while exercises. let the sweat flow drom each part of ur body. & c the change in ur life. good luck

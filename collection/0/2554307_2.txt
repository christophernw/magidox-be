I know KFC actually make the sandwiches/meal up to order so there should be no excuse.. . Next time you get refused, ask why, and if they don't give you a satisfactory answer ask to speak to the manager. If the manager doesn't give you a proper answer ask them who you need to complain to...get the address for their Head Office and send them a short, but polite letter asking for the reasons.

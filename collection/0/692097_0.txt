Water, wind and ice can all cause erosion in rocks.  Wind will often blow small bits of sand or pebbles at a rock, which can wear it down.. Water does something similar, slowly wearing down a rock over time.  This is why you often find round stones in and around rivers.. Water also gets into the cracks of a rock.  As the water freezes, it expands and causes bits of the rock to break off.

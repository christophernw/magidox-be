There are many programs for Native Americans.  I live in Oklahoma and I am a registered Choctaw.  You can get free health care, dental, vision, college scholarships, child care assistance, housing assistance, and plenty more.  To be registered here in Oklahoma, you have to have a roll number.  I've heard of lots of people having Native American heritage, but not being able to get benefits because they don't have a roll number. I'm not sure if this is the same for other tribes or areas.  You should definitely contact your tribal council because it's worth a try.

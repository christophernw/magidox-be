As a engine reconditioner l would advise you to take the cylinder . head to a machine shop to be cleaned properly & to have the head face skimmed.. When dismantling short motor make sure each big end cap is kept on the same connecting rod.Also make sure each piston/con rod assembly goes back in the same bore.. The bores of your engine will need to be honed to allow rings to bed in, if not done correctly result will be high oil consumption.. when reassembling check big end bolts do not need to be replaced.BOLT FAILURE IS CATASTROPHIC!!!. P.S when head is at machine shop get your valves & seats cut properly as you will be grinding valves & seats for days and the job won't be as good.. . Hope this was of help.

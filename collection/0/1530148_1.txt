Persepolis was an ancient capital of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, situated some 70 km northeast of Shiraz, not far from where the small river Pulwar flows into the Kur (Kyrus). To the ancient Persians, the city was known as Parsa, Persepolis being the Greek interpretation of the name. In modern Iran the site is known as Takht-e Jamshid (Throne of Jamshid).. . The largest and most complex building in Persepolis was the audience hall or Apadana with 36 columns, accessible by two monumental stairs.

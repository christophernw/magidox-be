Water enters the plant through the roots, by the process of osmosis. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration through a partially permeable membrane. So the root is partially permeable and it allows the water to go into the roots when it is needed because of the transpiration pull as the plant loses water in its leaves at the top.

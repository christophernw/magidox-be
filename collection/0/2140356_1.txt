You have to check out what type of exercising your doing, if you're on aerobic exercise your pulse rating must be (The 65% of the result of 220 - your age). You have to keep this rating during 30 minutes if you exceed it then you're doing anaerobic exercise. . Aerobic exercise will help you to lose fat, so your size will diminish, and your appearance will be thinner.. Also talk with your dietitian about how many calories is your diet. You don't have to feel hungry. And now that you may be eating more fruits and veggies you may feel satisfied earlier or may feel you have eaten too much. But when you eat like that you eat "volume" low in calories; instead of too much calories (high in fat) and with little volume.

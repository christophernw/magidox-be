Einstein was an atheist, as evidence by his own book, "The Human Side." Here is a quote from the book:. . "It was, or course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.". . Steven Hawking is also an atheist, and in his book "A Brief History of Time," he concludes through scientific evidence that a god of any kind was completely unnecessary to the creation and establishment of natural laws of the universe.

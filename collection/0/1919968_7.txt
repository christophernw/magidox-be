I have met some descendents of Native Americans with Mexican in them and none of them will have a thing to do with alcohol and find it extremely dangerous and it is offensive to be a drunk. I don't know if it matters they were all minutely related to each other....  . . So some do not fit the stereotype. I bet there are others.

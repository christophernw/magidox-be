The epiglottis is a thin, lid-like flap of cartilage tissue covered with a mucous membrane, attached to the root of the tongue, that guards the entrance of the glottis, the opening between the vocal cords. It is normally pointed upward, but when swallowing, solids or liquids stimulate sensors which folds down the epiglottis, and prevents food that should go into the esophagus and stomach from passing into the trachea (windpipe). The epiglottis is one of three large cartilaginous structures that make up the larynx (voice box).. . basically it stops food from going down your throat the wrong way and choking you by getting into your lungs it sends food to the stomach

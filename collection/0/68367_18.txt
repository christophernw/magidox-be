Funny how many of the answers have not addressed the discrimination which WHITE PEOPLE ARE DIRECTING TOWARDS OTHER WHITE PEOPLE - e.g Polish people in particular. Everyone rants on about Muslims, Blacks and Indians invading Britain but in actual fact the greatest influx has been from Eastern European countries as a consequence of countries being permitted entry to the EU. I live in a very multicultural area of Britain and all I hear on a daily basis is the racist opinions of whites directed towards Polish people.. . To be honest I have now come to believe that if every single non-white person was to leave Britain the remaining population would still moan about migration.. but this time they would be moaning about migrants coming from the Eastern European countries!!

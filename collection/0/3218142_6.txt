In the history of the world? That might be the battle of Marathon, the Greeks first victory over the Persians.. . their victory endowed the Greeks with a faith in their destiny which was to endure for three centuries, during which western culture was born.  John Stuart Mill's famous opinion is that the Battle of Marathon was more important an event for British history than the Battle of Hastings. . . The longest lasting legacy of Marathon was the military tactic of double envelopment (or a "pincer movement").  Miltiades, leader of the Athenian Army,had personal experience from the Persian army and knew its weaknesses. As his course of action after the battle shows (invasions of the Cyclades islands), he had an integrated strategy on defeating the Persians. In the battle of Tannenberg in World War I the Germans followed the same tactic as in Marathon.. . Personally, I have to give a stong vote for June 6th, 1944....D-Day. This battle may have decided the outcome of WWII or at least if the Allies had been hurled back into the sea, the war might have lasted years longer and cost millions of more people their lives...

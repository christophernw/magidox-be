Based on the way you asked this question and the answers to other questions that you posted, the only advise I have for you is to read a few books about liberals written by liberals. It is evident that your opinions are based on what you have learned from others who think like you. I can't even begin to explain how distorted of a view you have of what a liberal truely believes.

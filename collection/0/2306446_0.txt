The process is known as osmosis.  Water and minerals in the soil may have a greater concentration than that on the other side of a membrane on the surface of the root.  The water and minerals pass through the membrane and can be carried up to the top of the plant (even a tall tree) by capillary action, the same effect that draws oil up a wick.

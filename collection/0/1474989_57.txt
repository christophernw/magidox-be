Honestly. I believe, if there is a God in the sense we think, that He doesn't kill people. Why would an almighty being control every single life and death of comparatively insignificant creatures? More accurately, most die without any intervention; if God truly has an effect on one's end at this point, it's to perhaps prevent it, which doesn't happen as often as you would think a just God would allow. But other than that, I guess people just die. How can people still try to reason suicide bombers and stillborn infants and mass murderers as "part of His divine plan"? At this point, I don't think ANYTHING happens for a reason...

Satisfaction is contentment with something, or someone. Whether you are satisfied with something depends on what you expect a certain outcome to be, and your outlook on life is in general. Are you an optimist, or a pessimist? There are malcontents, who are NEVER  satisfied with anything.If they win a million dollars tax free, then they think to themselves that a million just isn't nearly enough.

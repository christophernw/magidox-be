you could pick her up take her out to lunch and tell her you need to pick up some groceries, you pickup some pantry staples and let her shop or suggest why dont we spend the evening making dinner together and leave her with ALL the groceries. . Borrow her car when she comes over (make a lame excuse like I dont want to take mine out from garage) run out to gas station and fill up her tank.  little things like that .....from time to time.

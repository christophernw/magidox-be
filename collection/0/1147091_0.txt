aahh... advice for a little freshman coming from a junior... okay- stay out of the way of the upperclassmen. don't stand in their way b/c u will get pushed, shoved, and HURT. don't try to sit at a table with upperclass men- u will get thrown to the floor. don't try to convince upperclassmen that ur not all "stupid little freshmen" b/c even if ur right, they're still gonna call u that. don't run around talking about how awesome ur graduating class if. ur the class of 2010- enough said- and the other classes will just shoot u down. don't think that ur all hot and cute cuz u will never look as good as the upperclassmen/women. do not by any means think anyone from another class is ur friend. they're not and they will make fun of ur immaturity behind ur back- stick to ur little freshmen friends. oh and don't be all excited about being a freshman and finally being in high skool- u just got knocked from the top of the middle school food chain to the bottom of the high school food chain. good luck with being a freshman (oh and don't EVER refer to urself as a freshie) and just remember to stay in ur place and keep ur mouth shut until next year when ur not a stupid little freshman anymore. by the way- think of "stupid little freshmen" as a term of endearment. at least u freshmen have a nickname. but in all seriousness- being a freshman isn't as bad as it seems. i hope u enjoy high skool as much as i am and try not to live up to the annoying stereotype of "stupid little freshmen". good luck hon!! lol!!

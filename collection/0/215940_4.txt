Seems self-evident to me... It may be easier to think of the answers for this if you think about what happens when one is NOT prepared. I've seen speakers get completely flustered when their powerpoint slides didn't work or when someone asked a question and they didn't know how to handle it... it makes less than a glowing impression when one cannot sail easily through one's presentation... it can make the audience think, "why should I even continue paying attention to what this person has to say?"

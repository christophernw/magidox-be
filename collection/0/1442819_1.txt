Atheist don't believe in an entity(s) or god(s).  They deny the supernatural plane of existence, either 1. practically (cannot be know and has no influence on the material plane so don't act like it exists) 2. It actually doesn't exist.  Atheists believe that the non-existence (or in accessibility) of the supernatural plane can be proven by science, reason, and philosophy.. . There are two types of Atheists:  1.  Chaotic / Anarchist types who believe that everything is random, there is no truth, and nothing matters.  2. Those that believe that there is a system / law that governs the universe.  Things don't happen for "reasons" but rather they happen in accord with the laws.. . Agnostics come in different stripes.  They are unsure about the spiritual plane and typically think that it cannot be proven either way.  They believe that it is important to act in a generally good sort of way which is dependent on relativism, skepticism, and individualism.  They are not terribly philosophical in their world view.  Typically you find them as  XXXX Agnostic where XXXX is a specific religion and they believe that all religions might be true but there is "probably" more true.. . The primary difference between, agnostics, atheists, and theists is their understanding of the relationship between the spiritual and material planes as instructed by their philosophy of knowledge and metaphysics.

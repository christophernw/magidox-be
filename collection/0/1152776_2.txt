I'm not sure but glad someone out there worries about that too! . even though i think it is just as likely to get sick from being in a public place and breathing a sick persons air.. i mean stomach bugs and the flu is dismissed as "going around" and no one stops to think where they got it, my point being i dont think there is a way to tell. but there are certainly bacteria on it, sorry i cant help you!

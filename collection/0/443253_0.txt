Star-crossed is a term coming from astrology... see, back in william shakespeare's day, things were based heavily on astrology. Romeo and Juliet's romance was not "in the stars" to succeed... in fact, it was destined to fail (by astrology standards) hence, "star-crossed". the stars destined them to fail, but they tried anyway. they were crossed by the stars.

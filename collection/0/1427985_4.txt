Basically, an urban legend is a story that is repeated many times. People come to believe that it is true because no one knows where it started and they have heard it told so many times and from so many sources that they assume it must be true. . . With the Internet and 24-hour news coverage, urban legends are increasing in numbers because of the many opportunities for them to be disseminated widely and quickly. Just look at all the horrible stories that came out of the first days of Katrina, many of which were later debunked. But people keep telling the stories so another urban legend is born and never dies.

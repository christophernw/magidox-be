My son also had these spots, our doctor said it was caused by pressure,(sinus, eye, behind the eye etc) they are little broken capillaries. My son is 8 now and his cleared up at about age 1, after an ENT specialist discovered a perforated eardrum (long story,they say he was born that way), that's why he cried ALL the time. Not to worry it should clear up, but check with your doc just in case.

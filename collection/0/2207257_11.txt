There were not better excuses for that. It was the worst mistake US has had in his history. In order to help let's go to be united in the Ideology of Union Accepted for all cultures. The Noble People of America deserve respect everywhere. Many think President G. Bush has violated the law in many ways. Why is not possible for Him to close TV pornographic places where there is bestiality and a flagrant disrespect to the Noble Girls of America? . Instead of trying to destroy the enemy, I suggest an Ideology of Union accepted by Muslims, Jews and Christians. Its ground is "Be conscious of the great value of Life and its Transcendence" with this in mind, it would be easy to: "Be genuinely sincere, grateful and respectful with The One Who Gave us Life, with Nature and with ourselves" Please find it complete and free of charge this Ideology in: "AWARENESS, The Meaning of Life" as a present for your Good Will.

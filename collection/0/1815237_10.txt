Every country has the right to protect its people, society and laws.  I don't understand why people complain because the US is trying to protect its southern border. If I were a US citizen, I would want the government to protect that border.. . To answer you, the US government is protecting its labour market because the citizens have the right to work first, then foreigners just like we have it in Canada.  I do not want to see a foreigner working doing a job I can do, while I am sitting unemployed. Canada is my country and I have the right to work first. Same applies to the US.. . Back to you, I wonder why you even wanna go work in the US since there are high paying jobs left and right in Canada and that also explains why there isn't a work force flow from CA south to USA.. . I hope that made sense.. . PS: I just read your other questions, you're far from being Canadian to me dude.  I think you're just trying to find a sneaky way to get to the US from our friendly border but the INS are smarter than what you thought, aren't they?

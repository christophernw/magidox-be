the American english language is dilluted and polluted just like their culture and holiday meanings..  . --Money spent on Halloween decorations are quickly catching up to Christmas decoration spending levels. The holiday is nothing more than a day to dress up in "theatrical" costumes. Cinderella is not scary, girls.. . --Christmas music has been playing full time on some radio stations 2 weeks ago. Not to mention that it's becoming more prevailent to filter all religious ties, attributes, and connotations from the Christmas holiday. WTF?. . I swear, if I hear one person say, "I can't afford Christmas" or "It's going to take me until next summer to pay Christmas bills off"....

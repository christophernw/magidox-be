I'm not sure where you stand because I didn't take the time to read the details (lil lazy, sorry) but I think even though Bush really has made a lot of mistakes, it's important to stand behind him. Because I've no doubt that if he is running a country that hates him, he certainly isn't going to turn himself around and do a spectacular job. We must forgive his errors, and his harsh opinions, and stand behind the choice we made (mistake or not).. . Sincerely,. A Christian Democrat.

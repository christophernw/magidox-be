Check the water expansion bottle, see if there is any oil in the water, you can see a film on your fingers if you dip them in the bottle. Or if it doesnt have an expansion bottle, just take the radiator cap off and dip ur fingers inside. Sorry I think maybe in USA you have different names for car parts, hope u know what im on about!

great question. why all the mysteries? why all the riddles? why all the proxies and people doing his dirty work? to that end, WHY DOES GOD LIKE TO WATCH?. . god moves in mysterious ways so he keeps you guessing and in a good deal of fear of his wrath...because if god were predictable you could start dealing with religion using rational thought and logic and we certainly can't have that now. use ockam's razor: the simplest explanation is the correct one. not the sinuous, bending one that is useful for someone else's ends

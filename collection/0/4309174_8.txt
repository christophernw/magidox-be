It's mainly all african and they have the stupidity to call it culture.What it is is torture, and disfirgument. It's like the tribes with the large plates in their mouths(women). Originally it was meant to make the women ulgy so  african and arabian slave traders would not kidnap them to sell as slaves or wives. That the men began to use it as a means of control and theoir own enslavement of females. And ove rthe years it has been so accepted in the tribes that most men will not marry a woman who has not had the plate inserted.  It's plain  male domination and incrimination of women at play,, nothing else.. People who  circumcise women do so to control her, degrade her, and make her disfigured so no one else will want her. in this manner a tribesman can have many wives to support him never fearing soemone else will want them from another tribe.. The shame is that most tribes women goes along with it as they were done so as children themselves.(much like muslim women are dominated, and degraded into believing it's the right thing to do) and as adults with little in life to enjoy they actually turn on their daughters tio d this ot ensure they will get a husband. and like I said they have the  dam nerve to call it culture. even mos tblacks here in america approve it for them.  It sucks

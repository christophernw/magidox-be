If your cat is young, she might still be teething.  Give her a few hard treats each day ex. Pounce.  It's also good for tarter control.  Have chew toys for her and other toys that she likes.  All cats do this and you could lose some nice things.  I'm sure she'll outgrow it.  All my cats have done this.

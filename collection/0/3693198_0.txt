The uterine blood vessels expand during pregnancy, and they are basically just snapped off after delivery when the placenta detaches. Once that happens, the blood vessels are supposed to seal themselves off to prevent hemorrhage. Sometimes they don't stop bleeding, and in order to stop it, your body forms a clot. If that clot gets moved further into the blood vessel instead of out into the uterus and outside the body, then it can eventually travel to the heart, and then to the lungs, where it can officially be called a pulmonary embolus (before that, it's just a thrombus).

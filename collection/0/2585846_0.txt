I really don't know what will lighten the smell but I do know what will keep the cats away.  Sprinkle crushed red pepper around (the kind you get in the packets at the pizza parlor) this really works I have tried it and no more problems.. Also if you have a problem with cats using your flower beds as their personal litter box, sprinkle the red pepper in the dirt.. The pepper flakes do not harm the cats, they do not eat them.. It is the scent such as vinegar and citrus these do not harm the cat they keep the cats away.

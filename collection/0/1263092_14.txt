Weird stuff.  Animal stuff...."lost dogs" especially.  That really cute Budweiser commercial where the little baby Clydesdale tries to pull the beer wagon with the too-big harness...and his mom and dad Clydesdales help him...that just makes me weep.. . "Old Yeller".  "My Dog Skip" (I can't even think of that one without getting a lump!)  The thought of my dog dying (she's 13). . Why?  I dunno.  I think I may be a Franciscan at heart.

Just so you know fresman year is the worst year.  You get no respect from the upper classmen either.  And all your so called friends aren't your friends anymore.  And if you're pretty be prepared for a lot of jealousy, even if you don't know the person.  I hate high school or at least the high school I am going to.  I am glad i am switching schools next year.

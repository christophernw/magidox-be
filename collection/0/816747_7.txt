mainstream use of helicopters, not just to be used as support gunships, but more importantly to use to get wounded out of the combat zone. helicopter evac missions could have saved alot of soldiers as it saved thousands in vietnam and other wars. in my opinion that would have been the greatest weapon. the more troops you save, the more troops you have to fight another day.

I think they have low insecurities about themselves and their bodies. Seeing beautiful people on TV like Lindsay Lohan, Angelina Jolie, Hilary Duff, Nicole Richie makes them feel like that they need to look like them because they are so skinny and so good looking. These days more women are choosing to stay skinny and not eat instead of staying healthy and keeping their curves. Alot of people tend to say things like THATS STUPID and WHY ARE THEY DOING THAT? but you dont know maybe that person is getting picked on because of her/his weight or maybe that person was once overweight and is afraid to be overweight again. We really shouldnt be making fun of them or saying that their stupid because this is a important issue thats affecting people today. Instead we should be supporting them and helping them.

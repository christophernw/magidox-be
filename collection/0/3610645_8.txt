I like anyone who is capable of carrying on a conversation in a rational, respectful frame of mind.I can respect anyone's beliefs even if they do not match mine as long as they are not verbally assaulting me with it. I am a Christian and I try not to discriminate against anyone. However I am human and I do tend to stay away from people who appear to be limited in their ability to be nice to others.

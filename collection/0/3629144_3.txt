I think it's because some people believe atheism is more "intellectual."  It's not, of course, although it may be a step along the way.  It is often necessary to quit one's parents' religion by way of atheism, and then start finding one's own path to God, or Higher Power, however defined.  Or possibly when someone has parents of two different faiths, atheism is the only plausible escape route.  Sometimes, though, I suspect it is that they have a reasonably fortunate life, and have never felt the need to call upon the strength of a Higher Power. That "main friend" phenomenon of which you speak is something that often comes out when there are problems in a person's life.  Bad luck of whatever stripe.  Maybe that's why so many people make it a point to pray on their knees; to represent that humbling that caused them to look for a Higher Power.  Me, I pray in any position I happen to be in at the time.  Besides, my knees hurt too bad for the kneeling.

The main difference between reflectors and refractors is that refractors help you see far away things by bending the light to magnify them.  Reflectors also magnify, but they also help you see far away things by collecting more light, so you can see them better.. . For a beginner, a refractor is better.  But if you wanted to look at very faint things, you would want a reflector.

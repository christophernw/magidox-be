Considering most males leave the birth control up to the woman, I think if the man and his partner are truly not wanting any children then its a great for the man to have this done. Its a minor surgery and healing time is fast. Women have to go through menstrating every month, if they get pregnant they have 9 months of it then hours worth of pain for delivery. Its the least a man could do to help out in this situation considering women have it alot harder.

I would say a fatalist or a defeatist. Idealism implies the possession of ideals and this in turn implies the possibility of aspiring to realize them. By complete contrast, a fatalist relinquishes all control of her life and resigns herself to the vicissitudes of fate, whilst a defeatist simply surrenders all aspiration. Neither could be said to be an idealist: in word or in deed.

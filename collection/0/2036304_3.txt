The items that were given to Christ at his birth was as a blessing as the birth of our Savior the light that would guide us into everlasting forgiveness of all.  . . This is like what many do today at baby showers or when they visit new parents at the hospital.  You take them new clothes, toys, or even flowers to welcome the child into the world.. . The gifts that were given to Mary and Joseph were just that a gift of a blessing to welcome our savior into the world.

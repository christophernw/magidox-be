It was coined from it's inventor, the  Fourth Earl of Sandwich.  He was an avid gambler, and didn't want to be bothered by eating, so informed his servant when dinner came about one day to take the meat and place it between two slices of bread.  Thus the sandwich was born.  The real question is if everything invented is the best thing since sliced bread, what was the best thing before slcied bread?

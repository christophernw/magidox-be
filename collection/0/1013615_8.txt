Oil belongs to whomever owns the land.  In the US, it is mostly privately owned or, if the government owns the land,  it is sold to a private entity to extract the oil, and the money is "used for the public good".  In Iraq, the government itself owns and extracts and processes the oil.  They can choose to use the profits to provide money or government services to the population.

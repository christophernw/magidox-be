Many drivers are simply not paying attention and others are just rude.  Some are drunk; some are stoned; some are on the phone; others are putting on make up, reading a newspaper or shaving. Some are young and inexperienced; others are driving with impaired vision, in ill health and heavily medicated, and unable to focus and respond quickly.  A few are so slow they are a hazard. Others are  speeding, lane switching, dodging and ducking to get through traffic faster.  Some squeak by; some kill others; some die.  I've seen it all and it's a heavy responsibility staying out of the way of these drivers.  The bottom line is a lack of courtesy and the price is often too high.

Do you know how many atheists there are? And to say most of them are geniuses? There was this show, Perfect strangers, and one of the characters had a favorite saying: "Don't be ridiculous." . . Also, to those people who think having a very high IQ = genius or that genius is a matter of perspective -- both claims are incorrect. . . Einstein's IQ wasn't super high, and yet he was a genius. The guy with the highest IQ ever measured? You probably never heard of him. The only thing IQ tests measure is how well you can solve IQ tests.

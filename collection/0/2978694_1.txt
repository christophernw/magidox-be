Digital TV is not necessarily HD.. . There are several stations that broadcast the NTSC (plain old analog) signal and simulcast an ATSC (digital) signal.  With ATSC there are 18 different formats specified in the standard.  Only program streams with at least 540 lines of resolution are considered "HD".. . In addition to being "digital", the signal can (and normally does) have compression applied to it.  If the TV does a bad job of de-compressing it (or the broadcaster compressed it too much) then it can look blocky or soft.  I've seen a lot of shows being broadcast digitally that look worse than the simulcast NTSC signal.  BUT those shows were not HD...they were "Standard Definition" or SD.

While pole dancing may not be the classiest job around, it pays very well and you don't need any prior experience or intelligence, as you're implying, to do. That's not to say that only dumb people take those jobs. And also, just because one is smart doesn't mean they can have the pick of the litter when it comes to jobs while they're still enrolled in college. They may have a ton of debt that they'd like to minimize before graduation and stripping (or whatever you'd like to call it) is a good way to do that.

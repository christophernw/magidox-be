Can you at least speak Korean?. . When I met my husband he spoke only Spanish and I only English, and no, sex is was not our universal language. . We were able to learn to communicate over time. I had the help of a couple of books you know like the Spanish to English, English to Spanish dictionary and one other one that I can't recall (although it doesn't matter now).. . There are also some really good CDs for the computer now-a-days, check into those.. . Time as well as patience will help you through this.. . Good luck.

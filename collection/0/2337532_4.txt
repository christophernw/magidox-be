evaporation is when water turns from liquid to vapor.....the more water that evaporates, the more there is humidity cuz there is more vapor in da air and u feel kinda sticky n stuff like on the beach. . condensation is when it turns from vapor to liquid, like the clouds and they rain....so that duznt have to do n e thing with humidity, u just have water on the floor

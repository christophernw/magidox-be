At first there may not be any symptoms at all. The virus can live in the body without showing any symptoms for up to 10 years untreated. Symptoms do not seriously begin to develop until the virus has moved into the AIDS stage, which is the final stage of HIV infection. Within this stage, symptoms include:. .  Mild: fatigue, unexplained weight loss, mild fever, diarrhea, and sore throat..  Severe: loss of appetite, skin diseases, night sweats, and deterioration of mucous membranes.. .  The best bet is to get tested regularly if you engage in risky sexual activity, or use injection drugs.  If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact your local department of public health. Free testing is available, as well as risk reduction, and post-infection counseling.

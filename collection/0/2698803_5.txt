Easter is the holiday of holidays.It's the queen of all holidays, I should say.It makes me feel safe, because my soul gets full of  joy and hope that  comes from Jesus, our Saviour.. Every one in his life is crucified once or more times or through the lifetime but for a christian there's always a hope,that is the ressuraction of Jesus Christ.. Rationalists or spiritually lukewarm people may object and say that all this is a big fairy-tale but they are speechless when they watch the fire coming down on this day in Jerusalem, in the big church of sepulcher.This miracle happens every night at 12 or sometimes later on the day of Jesus' miracles ressuraction but after the Julious calendar,thet's the calendar that use the orthodox people in oldest Eastern Orthodox churches.After it the orthodox easter falls on 23rd of April.. Iadvice you to visit the site of the patriarchate of Jerusalem and get aware about this great miracle happening in our times.Idon't remember exactly the address but you can contact me by my mail and I'll give you it.. wish you have the joy of Easter.

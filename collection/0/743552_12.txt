Why should you prove anything?  If you believe you're right and you also believe they're wrong, they will be punished for their beliefs soon enough.  In the meantime, it won't hurt you to be polite, take one of their publications and wish them a good day.  After all, you know that they won't have many of those left, don't you.. . BTW, check out Richard Smullyan's books on logic and reasoning.  He goes into excellent detail on how one can be consistent in their beliefs, truthful in their statements and totally, absolutely WRONG.

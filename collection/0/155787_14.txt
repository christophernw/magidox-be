hmmmmm, maybe so they can eat. You are to pay a tenth of your income to your minister so they can concentrate on God`s works.. How in the world would they pay the light bill? Being a Minister is a full time job. People call you at 4:00 in the morning for the craziest stuff. You are there when they are born, You are there when they get married and you are there when they die.. They are there when you or your loved ones are sick, They go to prisons and preach, they go to old folks homes to minister there, They feed the homeless and children sleeping under a bridge tonight.. They go to the hospitals and tend to the sick and bring a ray of sunshine to the cancer patient or the AIDS patient. They are there when your sons and daughters go to war, trying to bring comfort to them.. Have you done any of this? When do THEY  have time to earn money to pay for your kid to eat dinner tonight? . . I mean, wow, a whole dime out of a dollar isn`t asking too much.. <><

OK where to start? Well first of all you can infact have dual citizenship. I am a soldier who has been in Germany for the last two years and I know for sure (although I am in Iraq right now, I was there before here) Not only is America the greatest nation on earth, it is in fact the land of opportunity. Being a European immigrant gives you a lot more job opportunities than being from anywhere else in the world. The only way to obtain dual citizenship, however, is if you were born in Germany. Now here is the downfall. If you choose American citizenship and decide to stay in Germany than you cannot stay there for more than 90 days and you cannot legally work there either. Where as in America, it is harder to obtain citizenship, but all you need is a SSN to get a job, and that does not take long at all and it is very easy to do. So in a nut shell, I would definately say get American citizenship.

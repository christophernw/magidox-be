Nikita is a Greek name. It derives from the Greek word “Νίκη” (in English “Nike” or “Niki”) which means Victory (yes the shoes company uses the Greek word).. From the word “Νίκη“ we have a lot of Greek names. Such as the bellow:. “Nike” “Νίκη“(used for girls exactly as the Latin "Victoria"). “Aniketos” “Ανίκητος” meaning unbeaten. "Nikator" a name used by the ancient  Macedonian(Greek) Kings meaning winner, victorious!. “Nicholaos”, (a very famous Greek name) meaning "Victory of the people". (“Nicholaos” can be found as “Nicholas”, “Nikos”, “Nick”, and “Claus”). And “Nikitas” (medieval/modern Greek) which means “winner”. . (“Nikitas” is only a male name but it was used (mainly by the Slavs) as “Nikita” for both male and females. That’s why you have a female character named “Nikita”. In proper Greek it should have been “Nike” or “Niketria”)

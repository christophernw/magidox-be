Assuming your taxable income is increasing each year, you do not want a refund.  You want to owe taxes.  Set your withholding for the current year to equal your liability for the prior year.  If you want to be really cute minimize your withholding early in the year and make up the shortfall (from last year's liability) towards the end.  The IRS is compelled to deem that withholding occurs evenly throughout the year so you'll still avoid estimated tax deposit penalties.  Deposit the difference between what you actually owe for the current year and the amount withheld in an interest bearing account.  On April 15th (and not a day earlier!) take the money you owe out of the account and pay your tax bill.  Put the interest in you pocket.  And smile when you write that check, you've played the game to perfection!

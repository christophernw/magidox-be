we have gone to "war" with the "terrorists" there and because of many political factors in making bush and our gov look good they don't wanna just go in and take the oil. also the reason why gas prices are so high has many factors like inflation, the scam that was going on between the gas companies and gas stations (until CNN and other news stations started asking questions), and the fact that many other middle eastern nations are either not trading gas with us or have jacked their own prices up. Another thing about us being in Iraq is just to raise takses to try and get enough money to pay off our debts to the International Monetary Fund.

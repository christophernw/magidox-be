The good news...AIDS is not considered to be a terminal illness anymore.  More people die from cancer, heart attack, and other diseases today than they did when AIDS first surfaced in America.  I have a close friend who got AIDS from a blood transfusion when he was a child.  He and his family recieved alot of money from the hospital but he is in his twenties now and he has more good days than bad days.  There are drugs on the market that you can take and when you take an AIDS test HIV doesn't show up on the test...when you have an episode you have to take more than normal meds but at least you still get to enjoy life.  Most of my friends would rather have AIDS than cancer...if you have cancer your survival rate is much lower and if you have to have surgery for cancer the second they expose the cancer cells and oxygen hits the cells they can spread like wild fire.  Good luck!  Take it one day at a time and remember that only people who are uneducated on the topic will be uncomfortable being around you.

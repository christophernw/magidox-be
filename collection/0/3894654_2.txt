It's not so much impossible to extend the idea of LCM, or least common multiple, from integers to any rational numbers as a matter of how would you define it and what would you do with it. For example, maybe LCM(2.4,1.5)=2.4 because 2.4*1=2.4 and 1.5*1.6=2.4 or maybe LCM(2.4,1.5)=1.5 because 2.4*0.625=1.5 and 1.5*1=1.5. I just don't see a way of defining it for rational numbers that aren't integers that makes a lot of sense or helps solve a problem. The LCM defined for integers lets you find the least common denominator for adding or subtracting fractions in a simple form, without making the denominator itself a fraction. If you have a complex fraction, you'd want to simplify it, not come up with a complex fraction as the result.. . As for the claim that decimal numbers aren't rational numbers anymore, it's just notation. For example, 1.2 = 12/10   It doesn't change the set the numbers belong to just because it's written differently.

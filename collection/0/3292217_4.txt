technically.... christmas is the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ.. . realistically.... christams is the celebration of Santa Claus. We eat, drink, and be merry. We give presents to each other. And we feel depressed and shamed if we do not have the means to provide such a wonderful celebration to our family.

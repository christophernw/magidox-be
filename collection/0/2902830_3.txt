Prayer is one of the most common things for all religious faiths. Some people are under the mistaken notion that prayer is asking GOD for help, or anything else that they believe they are lacking. So ask yourself what are you praying to and for what reason. My prayers consist of giving thanks unto the Father for His blessings, and that I might continue to serve His will, rather than my own ego's search for gratification. Hope this helps.

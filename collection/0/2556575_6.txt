DO NOT USE ANY DYE MEANT FOR HUMANS.. . If you really must dye your bunny, use a food colouring diluted in water. Keep the liquid away from the bunny's eyes at all costs. Also don't get any inside the bunny's ears. Afterwards rinse thoroughly with clean lukewarm water and use an old towel to dry bunny so he/she doesn't get sick.. . I have also heard of people using Kool-aid.. . Basically you MUST NOT use anything that is not okay to eat or drink. Stick to food colouring. Please.. . I really don't approve of dying your bunny but if you must, please use kool-aid or diluted food colouring. Anything else will hurt and possibly kill your bunny.

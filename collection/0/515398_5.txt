Well if you are working out you need to work that section more than anything else. Try not to rest during each set as much. If you are stopping and going. Your body is not getting that "umph" that you need to work the muscles properly.. . Also, if you drink. BIG STOPPER! Beer is the #1 thing that will add to that spare tire you have. Water is what makes up your body and when you drink beer your body is thinking it's H2O when it's not and stores faster than anything else you put in your stomach. What you need to do is stop drinking beer all together for awhile. So don't try and cheat by drinking 'light' beer, doesn't work. If you like to drink and can handle your hard liqour then do that, but the beer will get you!

Very hot or boiling water, when hurled into frigid air, will almost instantaneously freeze into ice crystals, but cool water won't.. Unlike cool water, boiling water is so close to vaporizing into a gas that it breaks into minute droplets when thrown into the air. Those droplets lose heat so quickly that they freeze almost instantly.. It's very beautiful to watch the ice crystals float to the ground.

Checking your pulse may be helpful in monitoring your heartbeat.  All you need is 2 fingers, and a pulse.  OK look at your palm, follow your middle finger down to your wrist. You should feel a grove that runs parallel to the vain that runs down you arm. Use your middle and ring finger to test for a pulse, because your index finger pulses and may messup taking someone elses pulse. Good luck. I hope this helps.

There has to be one legitimate church in the christian faith community. These evangelical churches are brainwashing factories pumping out bible-thumping, demon-seeing zealots. They're the real danger. The Catholic priests that abuse kids are just losers who make up a tiny fraction of priests. It's not like it doesn't happen in other religions.

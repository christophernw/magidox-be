Being a gay is not a crime.  When the society is still in non-accepting mood, you are forced to keep your feelings secret.  But your attitude and behaviour can't be hidden.  However I want to suggest you to divert your mind towards other avenues of life.  First of all stop thinking that you are a gay.  Start doing yoga exercises and pranayama methodically.  Read books on philosophy and spiritualism.  Keep the mind away from the feelings that you are a gay since you are not a gay.  Develop a positive attitude.  By following this method, a friend of mine is normal now enjoying married life with two children,  Gayness is a boon derived from the abnormal attitudes that developed from the adolescent period.  It is not a disease but a disorder.  The disorder can be brought to orderliness if efforts are made  with real zeal and sincerity.  Good luck!

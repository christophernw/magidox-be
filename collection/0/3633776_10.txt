There is a difference between evolution and mutation! Mutation simply implies that a species changes to fit there surroundings. Evolution says that one species changes into a different species! The peppered moth did not change species, it just changed to fit the surroundings to blend in with the polluted trees.  Going from a monkey to a human is changing species, not mutating!  If you believe that mutating is changing species then you have been watching to much sci-fi.  Viruses mutate to resist antibiotics, yes, but they aren't changing species.  Christians do not believe in evolution because it is nothing more than a theory, there is not proof behind it.  Many of Darwin's and other scientist supposed "pictures" of things supporting evolution were faked.  For example, fetuses.  A human fetus was compared to other fetus' to show the similarities, but the drawings were exaggerated and faked.

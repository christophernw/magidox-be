I have had that type of infection three times in the past year..always on my face too; my son got one on the bottom of his foot as well. We were lucky enough to get over it with the usual course of antibiotics. It is SOOO contagious so maybe that is why you keep getting reinfected. You have to clean everything that you come in contact with; wash your hands obsessively. Keep going to your Dr.; because as I'm sure you know, this MRSA can in fact possibly kill you. Good Luck, I really feel for you.

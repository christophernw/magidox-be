It can be a pain due to the AC line running across the firewall. Sometimes it is easier to take the whole air cleaner box off the throttle body,hose clamp  and 2 10 mm bolts plus 2 vent hoses.jbpopem is right ,you can snake it out,but may be difficult going in if not careful.Also after you change and drive,if your hear a weird throaty sound you didnt get the bottom of the housing on right. Good luck

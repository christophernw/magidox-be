Many of the morals are not new.I am not sure what new set of laws you mean. I know a few people that call themselfs Christians but their standard of morals are warped. In their eyes they are right. They are not true Christians. They are hypocrits. and they most likely do not know how to read the Bible in proper context. They are always judging others but are the worse Christian I know. They give us real Christians a bad rep.. God is the only judge. We may judge another in accordance to his actions and possibly disfellowship that person but at the same time, we must not cease in love for that person or any other person. A bad attitude is a bad Christian-not a real Christian-just a corupted person. If I thought a real Christian was a bad thing, I would not want to be one either. But I know what a real Christian is and its GOOD to be one.

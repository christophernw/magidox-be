Sara, that's a very comprehensive list, but no all those tests are likely to be done except in very special circumstances. the normal SCREENING panel for kidney disease would be Blood Sodium, Potassium, Creatinine, Urea and Bicarbonate and often Calculated GFR,, tests like Renin are highly specialised and expensive and would only be done if other results, and clinical sighns and symptoms indicated it was necessary. I used to work in a lab doing these tests, and whereas we would do The basic screening tests on some 4 or 500 people a day, things like erythropoetin and renin might well be done only 4 or 5 times a month, You list of Liver function tests is the normal screening panel

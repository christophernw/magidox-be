God puts every one of us on this earth for a reason. Only God knows that reason. When we have done our earthly duty, He will take us back to be with Him. In the case of your dear friend, maybe she was here to teach that very lesson to someone. That "someone" could very well have been you, but it could just as easily have been the jackass who gave it to her. Maybe God was trying to "save" him. Only God knows that. Whatever you do, don't let her death be in vain. Take up the cause and warn people NOT to start. As long as you believe, you WILL see your friend again! In the meantime, she is probably your guardian angel, so keep thinking about her, talking to her, and loving her.

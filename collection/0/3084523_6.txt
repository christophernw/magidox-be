That's a good question.. . The Bible speaks of abstaining from the consumption of blood of animals.  . . It is silent on the issue of transfusing blood from one person to another for life-saving purposes. . . But most religions -- including the Catholic Church, the one designated by Jesus with the power to bind or loose on earth things that would also be bound or loosed in Heaven -- consider blood donation to be a great act of charity.

It definitely sounds like your allergies are affecting your eyes.  You should talk to your eye doctor about your options (and to make sure that there really is a link between your allergies and your eye problems).  Your eye doctor can recommend an eye drop (most likely over-the-counter) that will work the best for your particular situation.

Oh my goodness, this started with the Barbie doll.  Girls have been taught for years that our society only loves thin, tall women.  How sad.  Our young girls just need to eat right, move around and not sit at the computer or TV so much.  It's very sad that girls can't feel good about themselves unless they are 'sticks' and breastless.

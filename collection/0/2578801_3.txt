Depends if it`s a first-degree, second-degree, or third-degree burn.. If it`s first degree, that is a light burn, then run some cool water from the faucet over it then either leave as is or lightly bandage. Do not rub butter on it. For the others, get medical help as there are problems with potential infections setting in.

Traditionally speaking, when you hear three knocks on the door and there's no one there it means there is a death forthcoming (at least in the Irish-German tradition I am familiar with as both the Irish and the German sides of my family have said that's what it means).. . My grandmother's mother had been in good health but one day when everyone came home (she had stayed behind for some reason), she told them that she'd heard the knocking and that she'd be dead within the year.Coincidence or not, she actually did die within the year.

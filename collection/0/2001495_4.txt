The structural failures happened around the windows, but were due to the installation of ADF antennae in the top of the fuselage above the 4th window back. The fuselage wasn't designed to have a hole in it at that point and so the installation compromised the structural strength and caused a weakness in the fuselage at that point - the window shape simply provided a weaker point for the stress to show. The Comet was used by the RAF until the late 1980's as the Nimrod airborne surveillance aicraft with no problems!

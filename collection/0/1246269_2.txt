A pardon for a crime committed come from the governor of a state, or from the President of the U.S. What the pardon does in effect is to wipe out the restriction imposed on you like voting, owning and buyings guns, etc. In other words, a pardon restores you to full priviledges as a citizen. Even if you have served your time and are freed, you cannot vote, own, or buy guns had you not gotten a pardon of some sort.

I can't speak for all of Christianity, but my church doesn't teach me this.. . The Church and the Bible does not teach that sex is vile, what it teaches is the sanctity of marriage, which in itself is the continuation of life.  Marriage was not always about love, rather about property and children.  Many marriages were arranged between families to enrich ones land or blood line.  Many royal families married other royalty to form alliances.  The church teaches sex should be within the confines of marriage, to protect the souls of those who are created out of the act.  Sex in this instance is an act of god.  Love is an entirely different entity.  Love is a human emotion not bounded by the dogma of christianity, nor controlled by it. . . As to the concept of heaven/hell, this can be traced throughout time.  Dante's Inferno is a great example of this.  The ancients believed in one place for both heaven and hell with different tiers to determine you eternal place...from the Elysian Fields of bliss to the torment souls who were forced to perform tasks until the end of time.  The most recent christian formation of hell can be traced back to the Spanish Inquistion and the rise of the anglican church in Europe.  . . In short, no this does not mean you can only have sex with god; but you should think about your actions and who will be hurt when you have sex.

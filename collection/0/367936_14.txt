White people are being blamed for all that is wrong in the world even though white people have contributed more to the advancement of humanity than any other race, and now it is white people who are being discriminated against by society. Those who form groups like NAACP, and United Negro College Fund are just as guilty of discrimination as the KKK, and an honest examination of crime statistics would find that there have been more white victims of black criminals that there have been black people lynched by the KKK. All forms of racial discrimination are evil, and affirmative action and all other such programs only serve to perpetuate racial hatred.

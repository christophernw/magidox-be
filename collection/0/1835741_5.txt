There really is no way to cancel a pregnancy without having an abortion,unless you miscarry. I would suggest seeing a couselor or someone you can talk to so that you can make the right decision for you.However, don't wait too long, You have to make a choice soon. If I was you I would have the baby and give the baby up for adoption. It's your decision to make so good luck and I hope you make the right one.

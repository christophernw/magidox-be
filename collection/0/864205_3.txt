Car nowadays don't use Freon, They use R-134a.  You can buy the test kit and the R-134a at your local Do-it-Yourself auto parts store, most kits also include pictures on how to test them yourself.  I learned how to do it a while ago and save my self about 100 dollars, that's what the shop was going to charge me to test and refill the system.  The kit only cost me about 15 bucks and took about 20 minutes to fix.  Try that first, it will most likely fix the problem.  Take care.. P.S. I bet the guys who are telling you it's impossible are mechanics, I dont use mechanics for anything, the majority of them are theives and will charge you crazy amounts of money on things that my litter sister can fix with a screwdriver and an auto-repair manual.  You should invest in that to. Oh, and get the kit with the gauge, so you know how much you are putting in.

ok well it depends on the way you look at it from a psychological point of view. there are such people (ex. Freud) who would say that the analysis of the dream is that your friend secretly wishes you were dead. probably because of something that may have happened between the two of you. i honestly wouldn't take much out of the dream but that is an example of one way to interpret the dream

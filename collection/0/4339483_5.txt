The reason you are eating so much is probably because you are bored or sitting around food or maybe it's all in your head. If you exercise or go for a walk you will take your mind off food and actually feel more full. If you do have a big appetite, try to eat healthier. Drink a glass of water before each meal and you should feel fuller faster.

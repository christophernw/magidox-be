I'm a mother,so i know how you feel.. It is annoying to see christmas stock out so soon,because as soon as the kids see it,it's i want this,i want that.. When i was a child,you never saw anything to with xmas,much before the beginning of December.. Greed has taken away the fun of christmas,as everybody is trying to out do one another,and sunday opening as well.. It's not just christmas,where everything is out early,look at any of the celebrations,Easter,Valentines day etc.. It really does make you want to hide your head in the sand until it's over and done with.

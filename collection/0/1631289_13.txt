I had to in 2004, and it was my dad's.  He had told me it was his wish to be cremated.  It was alot cheaper.   The thing I hated the most, and feel still alittle traumatized about is when the man said let me go get your father, and he just slammed the box my dad was in on the table.   I was not use to this sort of thing.   I just wanted to run out of the funeral home and cry.    So sometimes when I am like that I have to make a joke to calm myself down.  When I put my dad's box in the car I said "You sure picked the safest way to ride with me". lol    It made it alot easier.  I hope my dad heard me he loved jokes.lol      Anyway that is my two cents on the subject.

The conservative shift in society is a direct reflection of the conservative, straight-laced, bible thumping baboon we have in the presidential office right now.  He forces HIS opinions over the masses, passing laws by influencing members of government and the very richest to sway his way by padding their pockets with the almighty dollar.  His views are not the majority!  By far they are the minority.  He has the lowest approval rating of any president in history.  This is the proof.  Also it seems we've been living like hedonists since the 60's - and we're tired of it.

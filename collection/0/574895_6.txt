I would choose to have dinner with Acorna the unicorn girl who has healing powers in her horn.So that she can heal my mom.Rowan because she has the power to teleport anything with her mind and I would love to visit Australia.Eragon and his dragon Saphira.I have always wanted to ride on the back of a dragon and meet a hero with great powers.Romeo and Juliet because then I could tell them death isn't the answer.Love may be endless but death is final.Peter Pan and Tinkerbell because I will always be young at heart and in my soul.I would also enjoy the freedom of flight while they were here.

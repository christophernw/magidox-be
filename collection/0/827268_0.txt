My question too, and I do have the solution!!  at least for me.  What I do now, cause before I was doing to much is simple and works.  Well first if your out of shape you gotta work that fat off man then workout starts.  If you do ab workouts that take 30 or more reps in a set thats not going to build muscle because then your just conditioning your muscles.  Weights are the key.  Crunches, regular crunches will work great, but with weight, dont hold it to your chest but put it behind your head for more restistence.  Do 3 sets and increase your weight 5 lbs each set.  If you can do 20 or more reps with the weight u have easily u need to up your weight.  Remember, slow and controlled, not as fast as you can.  Start out with 18 first set,put 5lbs on,16(5lbs more), then 14 reps/ your last set.  At the end of each set hold your "up" position for 10 seconds and slowly lower yourself.  Excersise 2:  lay flat on the floor/ back to floor and place weights on you ankle near the feet.  Now lift your legs slowly up and down without touching the ground.  Use the same guidelines as the crunches.  Now u can do the cable machine.  Get on your knees facing the cable machine with the with bar being held firmly almost touching the top of your head.  Now crunch down.  Use same steps with weights and reps as with the other excersises.  With the cable excersise you have to make sure your abs are pulling the weight down, NOT your hips, they cant help else it'll be a waist of time.  These are just a few examples.  but after your workout u should take in high amounts of protein and remember to do cardio work.  And a secret to being more defined in the mid sectioin is EPHEDRA.  its an energy pill for truckers, etc, but once u get the good abs and want just a little more for the club and the night out it will help quite a bit.  Do these routines 3 to 4 days a week, good luck

While I don't consider myself a "filthy pig", I do think it is a stinky habit. I do not think I should be clumped in with the butt litterers considering I use ashtrays and Marlboro has even provided a butt container now. How 'bout the rest of the population, like the one I was driving behind the other day, that was throwing empty drink cups, empty food bags and cartons, etc. out of their truck windows? Should I include you in that group of people? Just because I smoke doesn't make me a "filthy pig" and until you supply my household funding and live my life you really shouldn't be judgin'!. By the way you should thank the smokers and alcoholics...their the ones the pay for your stadiums and such with the extra taxes they put on our cigs. and alcohol!. Also, this is the religion section...I don't see how this has anything to do with religion...other than thou shalt not judge!

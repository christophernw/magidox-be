You need to sit down and write down everything you spend in a weeks time. Everything - mortgage/rent, car payment, car, how much on food, gas, extras, utilities. Then figure up how much household income you have coming in. Then you have to budget and stick to it. You need to figure out how much you have to spend in a weeks time before you actually go out spending it. Good Luck

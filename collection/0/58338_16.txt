They don't have to.. . But that there is a daft question.. . It's like asking: "Why do humans have to believe in Oxygen?", "Why do they have to believe in Pain?", "Why do they have to believe in the Pythagoras theorem?", "Why do they have to believe in Gravity?", "Why do they have to belive in social justice?"

Ok. The way I get rid of the hiccups is a little strange, but it works every time. grab a spoon and a glass of water. Go over to the sink and put the spoon in your mouth horizontaly. Try to drink the glass of water. (you need the sink because this is messy and you might spill.) This cures my hiccups every time.

Accepting Jesus Christ as your savior. If I am right you were wrong because I am not even close to being a Chirstian. I am 3rd generation atheist, but I knew a christion once, and they never shut up about what it means to be one. Sorry if I offended any christians, but I don't see how I could have seeing as it is their duty to never shut up about christianity

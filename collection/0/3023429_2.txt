Back in the '80s before scooters came on the market There were only mopeds. 50cc with a top speed of 25mph. You didn't need a motorcycle license to operate them on the street. Just needed to have them registered and have a car license. I don't know of any companies that sell "mopeds", so you'll have to check with your states DMV.

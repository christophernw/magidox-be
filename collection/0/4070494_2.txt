Dont.  You will cause damage to its spine and back legs.  They are meant to walk on all four legs, not two, and it is really bad for a big, heavy dog to be doing this.  As for the neighbours cat; tie your dog up so he cannot get at the cat, walk him only on a lead, say NO in a really angry voice and make him sit every time he sees a cat.  It is NOT fun to see a dog chasing a cat; it is an animal fleeing in terror for its life.

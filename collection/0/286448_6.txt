For the jet enginess that suck in  a huge amount of oxygen its not as much of a problem. But even for those high flyers there are altitude limitations. Most commercial jets dont go over 45k feet. while the SR-71 would exceed 100k feet. Little combustion engines like the 172 that I fly usually top out around 13-14k feet.

Forgiveness is a wise concept. And a concept, that it is. You may forgive one for an act, but their punishment will remain. Forgivness is to save one from pain. Do you save one from pain when you could justifiably cause it? Forgiveness is quite easy, because the emotion of your suffering transforms into empathetic sorrow for your newfound victimised enemy.

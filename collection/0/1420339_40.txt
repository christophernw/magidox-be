It's probably a urinary tract infection (UTI).  They hurt!  An antibiotic will clear it up, or if it is a mild one, drinking lots and lots and LOTS of water, and making yourself go pee a whole bunch sometimes can get rid of it.  Usually a doctor will just call in a prescription for you if it is a UTI (Burns when you pee, feels like you have to go all the time).  You might not even need an appointment.

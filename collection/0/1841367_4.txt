The fit for hangers is called folding wings, and option offered by Boeing, EVEN THOUGH NO AIRLINE HAS TAKEN THAT OPTION. . the bent wingtips are called winglets. most new passenger/cargo planes have them. likee everyone else said, it boosts efficiency and aerodynamics. . another thing for improving aerodynamics is raked wingtips. These are not winglets, and are not bent. They are found on Boeing 777-200LR and Boeing 777-300ER aircrafts, as well as the Boeing 767-400ER. The raked wingtips help improve climb efficiency. to find out more, you can go to http://www.boeing.com/. Aircraft such as the Boeing 787( not out yet) use both winglets and raked wingtips. These help improve efficiency as well.... winglets are generally used on shorter distance planes, except for example the Boeing 747.. Airbus planes also use winglets. some airbus planes with winglets include the A330 series and the A340 series.. airbus planes also use fenced wingtips. these serve a similar purpose like winglets. but, they go up on both the top and bottom. you can see a picture here: http://www.airliners.net/open.file/1047954/M/  . I hope this information helps!. :)

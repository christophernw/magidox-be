I do the same thing too, even when I draw pictures.. I always break pencils. LOL. I always have to sharpen them, and they are little stubs in no time.. Its ok. You may grow out of it.. I havent though.. It could just the way you are. I'm right handed, but I do like things with a bold outline. I've always been drawn to dark outlined things, and things with bright bold colours.

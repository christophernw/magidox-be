Ahh! Paw(!) thing just needs cuddles and a chat!!  How about letting her in for an hour and then letting her out again.  Keep doing this as part of a routine (stick to certain times each day) and she'll get used to it and accept it as part of her life!  As long as she knows when she's getting food, milk, water, biccies, cuddles etc., she'll feel secure!

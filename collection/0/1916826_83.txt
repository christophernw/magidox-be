Not to be too bold, here, but animals generally have been known to be extremely sensitive to things we humans can't pick up with our own senses. Your dear pet could have been responding very normally to higher vibrations, none of which you nor I might be able to sense. Your pet could be responding to vibes, or some feelings which are present in your home that would not be present at your parents' home. Not just dogs do this. Our two cats both give very clear signals when they are picking up things in our home that are sort of like good or bad vibes. Some people don't believe in this sort of thing, but it does happen. Just look at your pet. It is very important to go to your dear friend and comfort him as much as you possibly can when he is so upset. That will calm him down a lot, that you are not upset nor afraid and that, as we say, "The coast is clear," will help heal him. Because animals are so sensitive, they have often saved human lives when disasters have struck. They have put their paws on telephones and "dialed" 911 (true story), they have physically dragged their owners back to a place where they can be seen by others and thereby helped back to health, our dear animals are like guides to us. They come into our lives for a bit and they do so much for us! Your dear friend needs tender loving care because you love him so much. I am sensing there definitely was something "there" that time when he got so upset. And the way he was  behaving was the only way he could tell you about it. Our cats both hunker down in hallways when thunder and lightning come. I go to both of them and calm them down. I sat with our old Johann one time through the entire storm. He eventually began purring and became a cat again.  Good luck to you in loving your pet all the more! Sent with loads of love and care from,   - G. in South Portland, Maine, U.S.A.

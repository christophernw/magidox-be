The one at which you most enjoy AND are most able.  Any work becomes work after a while, but if it is work you enjoy and work you are skilled and talented at, then it will be easy.  . . Tom Selleck borrowed a line from somewhere a while back, "Do the thing you most enjoy and you will never work a day in your life."  That sounds great, but we often don't have such opportunities.  I asked a retired businessman for advice for a job search and he said, "I don't know, I inherited money, bought a business and ran it for 45 years, I never had to fill out an application form or even read them--I had people for that."  Good luck, that seems to be a prominant ingredient of every successful person, though rarely the exclusive ingredient.

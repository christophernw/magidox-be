Creation of visual subliminal messages would depend (give me money) entirely upon your medium.  With static text, it is (lots of money) silly to try, since it will be quite obvious.  You will need a medium that is "refreshed" on a regular basis, and as quickly as (in small, unmarked bills) possible.  Motion pictures refresh from 24 or 29.97 times per second, and computer screens typically refresh (give me more money) from 60 and up times per second, so these could be some very good media for you.  Simply insert a short, simple command within one or two frames such that its duration (do it now) is too short to be consciously noticed, but its instruction is direct and simple.. . Sonic subliminal messages are much (bark like a dog) different in that most any sound may be used as the carrier.  The idea is that a sonic message, which again should be simple and direct, is "mixed in" with the (bark louder) original sound at a level just above human perception in the hopes that the subject will not consciously notice it but will still unconsciously pick it up and act upon it.  I don't have any specific (roll over) numbers as far as percentage of decibel output or such, unfortunately, so you should just play around with different values until you get something that seems (play dead) reasonable.. . Good luck!  (Woof!)

For Glowing Skin soak some masoor daal (red) overnight. In the morning grind it in a mixture giving it a paste like consistency, add few drops of unboiled milk, a pinch of turmeric powder, a spoon of honey and a few drops of almond oil or cociunut oil. Wash your face with this 2-3 times daily and leave it on for a few minutes. You will not require to use any soap or moisturiser as well. U must try it!

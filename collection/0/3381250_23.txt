Personally, I think this is a very good question!. . Example:. Why do all Whites get punished by, say teachers for being racist, why do they get into trouble when they swear at Black people?. . But why does the majority of Blacks get away with racism against Whites? I've been to a few school where Black people are hardly, or mostly never punished!. . Why is this?

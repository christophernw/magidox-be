there needs to be a balance. all good will lead to a utopia. utopias, the perfect world, is not appealing. no competition. nothing to look forward to. nothing new. all bad is not good either. who wants to live in an all-crook town? also, we need bad people in this world to show us that we need to be good. that may sound odd... but, think about it. we would not be called good if there was no evil around us.

Besides the reasons above.... . It's really hard to imagine a commercial airline crash in which a parachute could really do any good. Seems like most crashes take place near the runway -- not enough time to put on a parachute, or enough altitude to make it work anyway. If an airplane breaks apart at high altitude (tremendously rare) then I think everybody would pass-out due to lack of oxygen before they had a chance to put on a parachute. . . The only situation that I could think of in which a parachute would be useful would be if a flight had engine or landing gear problems, and a low-altitude bail-out would be possible (Look-out cows!) Of course, if you're on an MD-88 with rear engines, you'd have a significant hazzard! Can't imagine how long it would take everyone to get their chutes on and bailed-out. . . Let's face it -- commercial airline flights are very safe. Not sure parachutes would help anything.

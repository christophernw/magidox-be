Flea collars are bad for your dog... dont use them. They contain poisons that can effect their nervous system. The best thing to do it take her to a groomer have her use a flea shampoo... not a dip. Then you need to flea bomb the house because there are fleas living in your carpets and furniture. If you dont do this they will jump right back on her. Then call the vet and ask if you can use advantage or frontline on her while she is pregnant. If you can then go get some and put it on her after she is groomed and before comes back home.. . Good luck.

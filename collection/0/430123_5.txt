On this side of the Pond, we have Goof-Off, a handy cleaner for every kind of mishap, the main part of which is Xylene, mentioned above. You are sure to have an equivalent product over there.. I find Goof-Off in drug stores (chemists), auto supply and hardware stores. It won't harm paint, and will even help remove some decals.

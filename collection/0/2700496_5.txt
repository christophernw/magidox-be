Its not that our generation looks down on your generation, its that your generation is always talking about how we are so bad and you dont understand us and we dont understand why you dont understand us. If u really think about it, your generation was the same way when it was young. U should know that its just a thing teenagers do to distance themselves and be different from the generation before us.  I dont know if that made any sense, but I hope I helped u out a little.

As soon as  I connect the call (seeing it's a telemarketer, "unknown number" or unwanted call from the Caller ID) I hit the Mute button and let the call sit there until they hang up.  They usually use automated calling systems, so they don't have the ability to hit redial or call you back, so it generally provides at least a brief reprieve, without having to get into any debate. Don't believe that the National Do Not Call Registry takes care of them all-generally there is some fine print in your contracts and agreements such that if you are even one day late, or take advantage of a "Special Offer", you've unwittingly given them permission to annoy you.  The registry worked for me for maybe 6 months, and now they're back with a vengenance.

First of all, I'm so sorry you are one of those children who have to beg your parents to be parents.  Unfortunately, if both parents work and you do not have a parent BEING a parent, then you're left to pretty much raise yourself.. . I would suggest you do this:. 1.  Write a note to your parents and ask them to please remember that they have a child in the fifth grade.. 2.  In the note, tell them that you are disappointed that you are coming last in their lives. 3.  In the note, list the dates and times of when at least one of them should be at your classroom, and. 4.  Tell them that you would like them to be happy that you are wanting them to be interested in your life, in your school events, and in how you are growing up.. 5.  At the end, you can write, "I miss having parents, but what I miss the most is having my parents in my life.". . If they come back with "I'm too busy," or "I just can't because I have to work," or something else---then ask for the note back and take it to you teacher.  At least she will know and you will know that you tried very hard to get you parents to be parents.

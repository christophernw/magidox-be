It all depends on your concentration level. You need to think about good things, cherish old sweet memories, read something that interests you and stuff like that.. You can go for a long walk in the evenings to talk fresh air.. Dont think too much on the same issue.Its gonna build up tension within you. Things will be fine after sometime. dont spoil your mood for trivial things.. Do meditation - this helps a lot to get the peace of mind.

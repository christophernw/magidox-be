a gift is a gift is a gift for presenting somebody, a present however may not be classified as a gift to present somebody, the difference lies only in the eyes of the presenter who gives; the presenter presents with some hope to be presented back, ha ha ha; like all my boy friends who like to present their girl friends to Gaur but only with the intention that they get back all of Gaur's. Its only Gaur who gifts all His to His worthless boy friends, some bodmas, some drakula, some even shoitansssssssssss

Song of Solomon shows God made us to adapt to our environments.  Read these verses carefully, especially the first half of v. 6:. . Song of Solomon1:5 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon..  6 Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.. . It's macroevolution or interspeciary evolution that is false and unproveable.  We didn't come from monkeys.  Microevolution I agree with, that there was an original monkey species from which came gorillas, chimpanzees, etc...  God made original core species and told them to bring forth after their own "kind".

Because we have been programed to think that its ok for Men to do what ever they want. But Women have a code of conduct to follow. Its old school views that have not yet filtered out of main stream society.. . This baffles me because a man will say: " Because Men are doing the giving and women are recieveing." and " Who wants a person who has already been around"? . . Well, its a double standard. Why would a woman want a man whore? Like we should just accept that our man has been with 20 women and its perfectly fine. Screw that crap!

look in a mirror, if you are Christian.. Explain the Crusades, the 30 Years War, The Inquisition, the European Witch trials, The Salem Witch Trials, the invasion and occupation of ? Iraq ? .... I would say true Muslims are NOT.  Ever read the Koran ?  I don't think you have. . So who would Christ attack, invade and occupy ? Who would Christ torture and bomb?  . Why, if this is a Christian country are we so in love with the death penalty?

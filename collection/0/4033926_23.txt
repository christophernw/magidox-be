Yes 'ignorance is bliss' is a saying. But I think it is a justification conjured up to excuse a wilful ignorance. In other words the willingness to not be open to knowing all sides of the equation. To just wanting to see things one way. Hence the expression 'narrow minded'. If ignorance is bliss then laziness is excused and prejudices are ok. Bigotry is ok. Do I need to say more?

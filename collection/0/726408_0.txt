Flower petals and pinecones are two examples of spiral designs that use the Golden Ratio. Why this ratio of 1.618? This ratio provides the flower petals and leaves with maximum exposure to sunlight and allows rain drops to flow down to the root in the most effective manner. The sunflower positions its seeds in a Golden Ratio spiral because it is the most effective manner of having as many seeds in a given amount space possible and allowing them to remain un-crowded within that space.

first of all we need to teach the students 4 basic rules. 1) (+) x (+) = +. 2) (+) x (-) = -. 3) (-) x (+) = -. 4) (-) x (-) = +. . so once they hv understood these rules, we can take ur ques as an example.... -7 - (-5). as mentioned above (-) x (-) = +. so the ques now becomes -7 + 5 which equal to -2. . i think that its pretty easy now....

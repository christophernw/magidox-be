Generally, the amount of ejaculate a man, well, ejaculates when he orgasms has a direct relaitonship to how much stimulation he's had before actually coming. A long period of foreplay, or even teasing yourself, not letting yourself come right away should increase the amount you end up shooting.. . Plus, increasing your stamina like this will gain gratitude from the women you're with.. . On the other side of the coin, if you're coming relatively frequently, this could also cause less ejaculate; the testes can only produce so much.. It's probably nothing to worry about, unless you're currently trying to conceive, in which case you may want to consult a doctor and check your sperm count, etc.

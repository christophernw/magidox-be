We are all bewitched and carnal - humans sin. A little yeast makes a whole loaf of bread rise, a little "bad" can make the whole "bad" unless you learn how to identify and get rid of the "bad"  through the forgiveness of God and removal of our blemishes through His son. Yeast and sin spreads like wildfire and can consume you if you let it.

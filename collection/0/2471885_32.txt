When I first read your question I thought that this would have been an easy answer, but that's because I knew of one definition for apprehension. Upon further investigation I realize that there are more. I'm going to try and tackle the one you are taking about.. . Both apprehension and comprehensive mean to understand. With comprehension you understand the entirety of the thing. With apprehension you understand the thing but not its entire nature.. . example, you are teaching a child of 4 to count. You say to him "johnny how old are you". Johnny shows your four fingers. You say to Johnny "pass me 4 marbles" he does. So he apprehends the number 4. You then say to Johnny "What's the square root of 4 and while you are at it what is four divided by 4" Johnny stares at you like you have 4 heads. See Johnny does no have full comprehension of the number 4. He does not know every thing about this number. Had he understood all the potential of 4, he would have had comprehension of the number 4.. . I learned something too.  THANKS

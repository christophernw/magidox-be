Com'on people, you should know this.. . Put in the ice cube slowly, some water spills out, most of the ice is under water (about 92% due to lower density).  Ice melts in time and the water level drops very slightly due to: 1) water temperature drops a bit (higher density, lower volume), 2)evaporation.

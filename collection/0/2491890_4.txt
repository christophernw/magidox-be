Well such things happen... for some. Probably it's an energy-vamp. It has happened to me also. Like it comes over you and you can't move, make noise and it tries to close your eyes as well.. and being in it you see a kind of different world. Well if it comes and you can move your body try moving your head or just jolt it this will free you from it's grasp though it shall come back.. I am an atheist, but I know that names like Jesus Christ and some saint names will make it go away or just. it's a good time to learn energy work.. Be not afraid.. It can't do anything to you. No one can harm you with their energies.. Learn to control the flow of energy in your body, just imagine it flowing and direct it.(it's chi) And if you get feelings of warm energy creeping up your feet or arms then that's a sign that you can control your chi fully.. The more you learn and practice the more invulnerable you become to such things.. As for it's intent it's just evil.

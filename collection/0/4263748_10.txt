In general, talking about people's race is a taboo subject in America.  For example, if we see someone, we will probably not refer to the person by race.  If we happen to talk about it, though, we will often call the person a name that combines one of the races with "American".  For example, people can be "African-American", "Japanese-American", "Korean-American", and so forth.  "Biracial" would probably also work, as the first answerer said.  But Americans are unlikely to mention a person's race at all.

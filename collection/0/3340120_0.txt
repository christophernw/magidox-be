The reason milk jugs have handles is because the plastic used to make the jugs is so thin and flimsy that squeezing the sides to hang onto the jug could cause the top to pop off, even with screw-on tops.  Using the thinner plastic, often recycled plastic, reduces production costs.  If you'll notice, juice jugs are made of a much thicker plastic than milk jugs.  Many of the jugs do provide handholds, or at least ergonomic designs supposedly to assist in pouring (not just to make the bottle look pretty).

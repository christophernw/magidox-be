I'm not sure I completely understand what you are asking, but will try my best, and I apologize if I am being too basic/simple for what you want. Sex-linked traits, by definition, are those carried by the sex chromosomes X and Y.  Remember that men have 1 X and 1 Y, so any trait on the X is automatically expressed since there is no "matched" chromosome, thereby making the traits coded on his X chromosome the dominant gene. Females have 2 X'x so expression follows the rules more closely resembling the non-sex chromosome associated genes.

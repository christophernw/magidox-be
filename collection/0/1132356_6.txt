Ask Ted Kennedy.... . Commercial planes generally have their instruments and interior shielded from lightning, so all that would happen is that the lightning would travel around the outside of the plane and contine to wherever else it might go.. . With smaller planes (like Ted kennedy's jet), mostly the same thing will happen, but the instruments might go on the fritz from the electrical spike just from being so near a high electromagnetic field.  THis is the same reason planes shouldn't get too near radio / broadcast towers.

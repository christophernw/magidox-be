CO2, while it is a naturally occurring gas, is being released into the atmosphere by manufacturing and other industrial processes which are not natural, creating an unnaturally high proportion of CO2, throwing off the natural balance of gasses in the atmosphere.. . You appear to be blaming the Democrats for calling it a pollutant...this I don't get...it is what it is.... . But guess what!  This is a GLOBAL issue, not a Rep-Dem battle!  The worst offenders may in fact be China and other developing Asian nations, Russia and the independent nation-states that were formerly a part of the USSR, and even India as well...it ain't just about us Reps and Dems, sonny boy!

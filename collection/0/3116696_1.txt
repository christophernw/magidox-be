Then why did radical Islamists destroy the twin towers on Sept. 11, 2001?  And why do they try to terrorize people and commit suicide bombings in Iraq?  Also, in Afghanistan, why was a man who claimed to be a Christian sentenced to die just for being a Christian?  Why did Saddam Hussein rip open the bellies of pregnant women & order the killing of children & women as  evidenced by the mass graves found in Iraq?  Also, why did Saddam order the gassing of thousands of Kurds just because they opposed his dictatorial style of government?

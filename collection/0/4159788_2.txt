If it's possible do it when you go visit him. But it's going to hurt him anyway, depending on how deep his feelings are for you. He'll play it off to his buddies like it's no big thing, then when he's alone he might cry or just shrug it off. I know it wasn't right but I broke up with a guy in prison who had asked me to marry him and had divorced his wife of 23 yrs. so he could. He was sent to prison for 5 years and in that time I realized how drug induced our feelings were and wrote him a letter telling him I had met another man I was going to marry and move out of state. It worked. Make sure this is what you want to do before you do it.

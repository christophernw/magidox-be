It is the light.. I don't know why, but I won't complain. That's how I kill the occasional rogue fly that buzzes around me at night. I get up, turn on the bathroom light,  wait on the little bugger to come in, and close the door. The room is white and they can't get away. Like shooting fish in a barrel.

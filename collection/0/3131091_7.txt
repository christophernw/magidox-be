Yes, it's too dry. You need a cool mist vaporizer (sometimes also called humidifiers). Don't buy the cheap kind that's just a fan and a tub of water. Those don't work. The vaporizer puts vastly more moisture into the air. There are also warm mist humidifiers but they warm mist can cause your lungs to swell. Cool mist is best.

Advanced Placement tests.  Often times, a good score on an AP test will transfer into college credit.  It's important to check at the college or university before taking the test to figure out the score you need to take to get the credit and if you'll get any credit at all (but I think most transfer).  This can be a wonderful way to get ahead in your college career by saving some money on credits and not having to take those classes in college!

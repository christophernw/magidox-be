This is truly a difficult and much involved question. I'm going to try a quick explanation and then leave you with an incredible resource that gives the facts in an updated version adjusted for laymen. Essentially the entire universe was in fact extremely compact at one point. Some type of event, often termed the "Big Bang", created a chain reaction that in a fraction of a second created the majority of the mass of the universe. Hydrogen, Helium, and Lithium were produced in vast quantities at this moment. During the aging of our universe, stars synthesized and created the remaining elements. Our world, Earth, began as dust released in these early stages and slowly coagulated to what we have now. I have skipped many important and large steps and you must keep in mind this process took the better part of 13 billion years. Check out the sources below and read the book if you have a chance.

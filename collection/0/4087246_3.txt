Gangs have their codes and rules.   Once you're duped into the false security blanket of a gang you've basically let yourself be brainwashed to a degree.    His best chance in life would be to get out of the gang and move on.   Generally people that label themselves as Skinheads are neo-nazi organizations that are racists, which might be the reason he doesn't want to associate with you.    I'm surprised their requirement is "part-white".

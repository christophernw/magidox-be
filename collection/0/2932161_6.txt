The dog is expressing exasperation at the audacity of the person watching it.. For an experiment try this next time you have a chance:. If you come across a dog defecating act as if you see nothing. then out of the very corner of your eye take a quick peek. You will see that the dog normally doesn't look funny at all until it sees you watching it.. Note: You have to be very sneaky, dogs have a sixth sense about this issue.. Consider dressing in camouflage and hiding in the grass next to a common "pooping ground".

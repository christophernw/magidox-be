How come you breathe? How come you know the earth is round? Cause it's just what has been proven to work in your life. Believe it or not, athiesim comes from great selfishness. It's natural human self preservation. Whether you believe you create your own destiny, or deny faith because your advanced scientific intelligence proves so. It's animal, it's man, it's you doing what works for you.. . Works for me.

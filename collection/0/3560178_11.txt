Yes, and numbing creams are just one of them. First of all you need to completely clean yourself, use an enema. Yes, I said enema, get them at the drug store. The keys to successful anal sex is cleanliness, patience and good lube. . . You start out small, a finger is a great idea, and then work your way up, perhaps with a small b*tt p*ug or dildo. Be generous with the lube, and use a water based lube like WET. You must cover all surfaces with a barrier, such as a condom or gloves (for your fingers). Try having your partner finger you while she/he does oral sex, everything relaxes with an orgasm. However, do not ever drink or do drugs when doing anal, you need to be paying attention. . . Once you get ready for a penis or dildo, then have your partner use a slow and steady in and out motion. The goal is to get the band of muscles inside the anus to relax, never ever force anything. Pain is your friend, its telling you that you are doing something wrong. However not relaxing will also cause a great deal of pain, so you need to be highly excited when you do anal. . . Never ever put a penis or dildo that has been in an anus, into a vagina. Stop what you are doing, even if it ruins the mood and wash everything with warm soapy water. Reapply lube as needed, and do stop by an adult marital aid or sex shop to get a good water based lube and some butt numbing cream. . . Good luck and have fun.

Diabetes, like any other medical condition, can prevent you from working if severe in nature. If you are unable to work at all due to your diabetes, then you are probably eligible for some sort of disability services. Contact your local social services offices to find out if you qualify for full disability benefits. Someone there is an expert and can definitely give you more help than you will find on this site. . . Good luck and best wishes...

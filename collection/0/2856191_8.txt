Unfortunately people think they need to have an abortion because it is most convenient.  People argue that abortion is a right.  Unfortunately rights seem to have taken precedence over responsibility.  Both are on par.  If you can't take responsibility, why should you be upset if your rights are lowered also.. . Do people have the right to do what they like with their body?  Sure they have the right to smoke and drink excessively, but they are unable to take responsibility for the consequences it brings.

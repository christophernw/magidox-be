First, it depends on the both of you.  MC (marriage counselling) will only help if you both want to try.   Think of it this way: you feel bad and talk with your friends.  He keeps it bottled up and then blows (guys usually do not want to talk or if they do, they talk different from gals).   Talking with a third party who hears both your sides can help if the counsellor is good.  . Which comes to the second part - the counsellor must hear from both of you together, and probably separately too.   If s/he is good, some good will come out of it.   Finally, it takes time - and once again, depends on you two - and the counsellor (don;t be afraid of changing the counsellor if it does not work).

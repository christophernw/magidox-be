I know in places like the middle east the have what are known as desalinization plants. These, similar to a water treatment facility, are just enormous plants that are very expensive to keep running. But what these plants do, among other things, is take the sediments out of saltwater from the sea and turn it into fresh drinking water. I believe there are filters used in the process among other things.

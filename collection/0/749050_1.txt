i would spend some time around children to get a feel for what your audience would relate to.  i suggest hanging out at elementary schools during recess, that's when the kids really let go and have fun.  there are also kiddie parks, you know, the ones with the swings and monkeybars and such.  you can go there and hang out and watch them play.  it's difficult to talk to them, because they're shy.  you should probably have some candy or some other treat to help convince them that you're their friend, and you just want some input on your illustrations.  it's professional to keep a copy of your portfolio with you in your car.  one suggestion is to show the kids the portfolio and ask them what they think of your work.  i would bring a video recorder to get documentation of their answers, cataloguing your data is a must.  psychological researchers have been aware for some time that the presence of parents will affect the validity of your subjects' answers, so it would be in everyone's best interest if you talk to the children alone.  don't tell the parents, because if the children know the parents are watching, even from a distance, their answers will be biased.  Oh, and you'll need some paint.

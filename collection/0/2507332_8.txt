Unless she's boinking your husband...she's still a friend of your marriage.. . Whatever needs she has are obviously more important to her because she's obviously in more emotional pain than you. (Especially if she's unable to be responsible for her own bills and drinks her money away). The betrayal you feel is a selfishness that hurting people resort to make themselves feel better.. Kind of the way a scared child will insist on having things their way to feel safe again.. When something goes wrong in any relationship you can either let it burn...(not recommended) or patch it up by spending extra time with your "ex best friend".. Tell HER how it made you feel. NOT your husband.. She's who you're mad at, right?. There's a slim chance she'll see your point.

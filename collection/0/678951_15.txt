I agree somewhat with the 1st guy.  But it is a bit deeper than that.   The bible does not tell you that smoking and drinking are forbidden.  It states that one should not allow themselves to be drunk.  More importantly, not to cause another man to stumble into drunkeness.  To treat the body as a temple.  . . Most people in this country are not christians.  They believe in  "a God" .  But most of them are not saved.  It is unfortunate.  Because it is a wonderful thing to know that there is a God that loves and cares for you.  And that you will someday meet in person.

I'm not so sure it is.  In American culture we know of Italian operas such as Tosca, La Boheme, or Rigoletto.  However, there is also French opera (Carmen), Russian opera (Boris Godunov), American opera (Porgy and Bess), British opera (Billy Budd, I think), German opera (the Ring cycle), plus, I believe, Chinese opera and Japanese opera.. . However, Italians developed musical terms, just as the French developed ballet terms.  The world, at least the Western world, decided to operate its opera according to Italian terms and its ballet according to French terms.

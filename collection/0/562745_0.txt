It's a condition in which air leaks into the space between the lungs and the chest wall.  It is serious because it leads to lung collapse and needs to be treated.  The treatment is to insert a thin tube into that space - called "the pleural space" that is in turn attached to a device that reinflates the lungs and keeps them that way as the leak heals.  Yes, it's a bit uncomfortable, but so is dying of asphyxia!

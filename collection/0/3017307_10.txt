some just for status reasons you know to say i have one and some to sell on ebay for more money. And most of them just want it that badly i mean it wuz the same for the 360 and their out there now for the Nintendo Wii. but yea it's so dumb cuz it's not like they'll never get one, but they just have to have it NOW. I don't get it either hundreds of people line up for one but there's only about 25 PS3s per store. some places had more but still everyone hopes they get one and don't care that they're wasting their time and having to sit out in the cold weather and possibly not even get one whether or not they pre-ordered. it's stupid.

start exercising or find an activity that takes the place of smoking pot. i find that working out is the best, because it makes you want to take better care of yourself, which is the total opposite of when you are getting stoned. sex is also a great replacement, because it combines exercise with your favorite activity of all time. plus it raises the levels of "happiness" hormones in your brain, so you get a different, natural kinda high.

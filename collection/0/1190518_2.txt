The Bible doesn't mention a lot of things that other texts do. The Apocrypha is the name of the collection of all texts that were excluded from the Bible. Some of them would have been in the Old Testament (like some stuff by Daniel), and some would have been in the New Testament (like the Gospel of Judas). A LOT of stuff has been cut from the Bible.

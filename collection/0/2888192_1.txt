Find a tutor, perhaps your teacher/professor may have a fellow student in mind if your school doesn't have a tutoring progam!  Meet with them a couple of times to see if they communicate with you in a way that you can grasp the material.  If not, ask for another referral.  The most important thing in learning is a common language or some spot of reference.

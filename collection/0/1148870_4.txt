First, Adam and Eve WERE husband and wife.. . Second, do you really need to ask?  STDs, unwanted pregnancies (leading to absentee fathers), etc.. . However, the real issue is much deeper than that.  The Bible talks about a special bond that takes place during sex, that the two become one (this is not just talking of the physical act).  It says that sexual sin is the only way to sin against one own's body, which is the temple of the Holy Spirit.  Purity IS a BIG deal.  No, it's not just natural, and yes, you can go to hell for it.  When you get married, you understand all the more just how big of a deal it is.

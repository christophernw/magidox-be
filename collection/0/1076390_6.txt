I'm currently agnostic for the very simple reason that I can't believe in any particular Christian God, but I also don't have any reasons to deny one...and I honestly don't see any hope of every being sure.  Blind faith isn't something I can easily stomach, and I typically associate it with unfounded beliefs, aka tradition, superstition, ignorance.  Also, the fact that people can actually be so sure of their beliefs as to dedicate their entire lives to impressing them on other people...just bewilders me.

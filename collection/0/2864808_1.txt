Veganism means not eating fish, poultry, red meat, dairy or any other animal by-products.  To simplify, vegans don't use anything which has been produced or provided by another species of animal.  Breast milk is produced by the mother during pregnancy specifically for the baby, as it contains nutrients essential to assist the development of the child.

Of course it would be landing since the tires are suddenly accelerated from approx zero mph (they might be spinning slightly from the wind) to approx landing speed within a few milliseconds.  Talk about your laying rubber.  I heard of an experiment that a aircraft manufacturer attempted to minimize this by putting vanes on the rims to get the tires up to speed before landing.  The biggest trouble with this is was now they had 18 huge spinning gyroscopes and it really hampered landing (it was a 747).

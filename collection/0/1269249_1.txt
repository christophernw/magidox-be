Take things one thing at a time.  Its probably overwelming at first but you can prioritize your time by solving each problem.  People can live normal lives with HIV..  There are cocktail drugs that you can take that will decrease your viral load to undetectable.  This will help with controlling the disease.  If you are still having problems mentally adjusting to the disease, see a therapist or support group.  You will find that you arent alone in this.  Human beings are really resilient to stress both physical and mental.  We are actually stronger than we think.. Its true and unfortunately many people get caught up with everything else..

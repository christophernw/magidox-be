Anak summed it up pretty good.  I actually answered this at length earlier today in another question.  Here's what I said:. . The gospel of Judas, for example, promotes a Greek philosophy called "Gnosticism," which basically says that matter is "evil" (for lack of a better word) and everything immaterial is good. Therefore, Gnostics denied the full humanity of Jesus, saying He only appeared to be human. This contradicts the Christian understanding of who Jesus is, as well as resurrection and the belief that God desires to save us completely-body, soul, and spirit. Christians are not to look forward to the day they die and are finally "free" of their earthly flesh, but to the day they are resurrected and live forever. Like it or not, you get your body back someday, the Christians would say.. . "Gnostic" comes from the word for "knowledge." (Hence and "a-gnostic" is someone who does not know, with 'a' meaning "no" or "without"). Gnosticism teaches that the goal is to attain transcendent knowledge, to have the proverbial "inside scoop.". . This says it quite well: "The term 'gnostic' derives from 'gnosis,' which means 'knowledge' in Greek. The Gnostics believed that they were privy to a secret knowledge about the divine, hence the name."

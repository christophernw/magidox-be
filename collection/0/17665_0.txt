Couple ideas come to mind:. - tape some aluminum to the window, the shiny material may scare off the birds. - nail some spikes, assuming the nest is at the window ledge, onto the window frame, it'll make the birds uncomfortable - this isn't cruel, just a common and old approach - alternative is to nail some chicken wire. - tape a picture of an owl, I'm not kidding, onto your window, move it every couple days. - mount an owl nearby, again, move it around every couple of days. - the hard way is to knock down the nest - but once there is cheeping and chirping, knocking it down is a decision you'll need to make on your own. . Good luck!

huh??? what kind of question is that??!?!?! 42 a number, and 41 is before 42, while 43 is after it.  and '42' can also be considered a word, b/c words have letters. forty-two....42 is a 4 and a 2 connected simultaneously. get a life and ask yo momma what 42 is....or give a direct question instead of 'why is it 42'. now answer me: 'why is it 43??' hahaha j/k lol :)

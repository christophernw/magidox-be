Water doesn't actually boil at low temperature. Many other compounds boil at much lower temperatures: Liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen boil at NEGATIVE 190-170 degrees celsius! Water actually has a quite a high boiling point (as chemical compounds go). Water molecules are held together by Hydrogen bonds, the strongest inter-molecular force. Therefore, the temperature needs to be raised really high (100 C) to break those bonds.

I'm not going to take my time criticizing you. I live in Oakland, work in San Francisco. My father came to this country illegally back in the 70's, he is now a nationalized resident. You must understand that at a lot of people who joined in on the protests yesterday were not illegals, they were people like my father who still value their Mexican roots, and will stand by their fellow countrymen. If they were to "round u" who they could, like you so eloquently put it, they would have sent many "legal American" citizens back to Mexico. If you can please, imagine the bad press the US would receive not only on a national level, but internationally. We would be more of a laughing stock to the world than we already are.

I can't stand attitudes like that! I believe dating is ment to find a spouse, not find a new "screwing" partner. Dating is getting to know someone, and see if they are compatible with you. If it starts to work out, then you see if it would work for a longer time. Dating is for finding someone to marry, not a sex play toy!!!

Hi there. I have had Palm and Pocket PC's, and Pocket PC's are muuuuuuch powerful; read again, POWERFUL.. . Yes, Palm OS works better with PDA memory and that kind of stuff, but the power of a Pocket PC is worth it.. . For your final decision, look around at PocketGear.com or Handango.com for nursing/medical programs, and see which platform offers more for you.. . One of my brothers is also a nurse, and he works for the Feds, and he have always used Palm, specially while working in Chicago, but then he switched to Pocket PC and he's in HEAVEN right now. :D

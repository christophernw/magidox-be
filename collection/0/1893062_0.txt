You could take it to a dealer, but if you have never done business with that individual, you may come out on the short end of any deal.. Start by using a search engine to look for the book on the web.  (If you do not know how, ask another question here with all of the information that you have).. You may have an item that would sell on eBay or through one of the on-line used book sites.. If you take the book to a dealer, try to find a second oppinion before you act.  Make sure that you wrap the book before taking it outside.  You do not want ot ruin it by dropping it on the ground.

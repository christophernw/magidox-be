yes this is true. but they haven't done nothing for me lately, called cops on guy across the street 2 times in 2 weeks. They never came. Good thing it wasn't anything serious. And why is it always the cops everyone is bowing down to? My husband is a fire fighter-- he doesn't get anything special. We spend 8 hours last Saturday volunteering for the community for a benefit (along with the rest of the fire fighters) and we went to Arby's to grab lunch. Did you know that fire fighters do not get any discount there but police get 50% off. Hummm.... all I got to say is, hope their building doesn't catch on fire cause they can just let the police put it out for them.

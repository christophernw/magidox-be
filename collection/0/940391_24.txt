As a teenager myself, I don't think I'm disobedient to my mum. Of course there are contretemps among us at times, but we get on really well in general. I don't agree with the idea that adults postulate, that is adolescence is all about quarrels and making efforts to get rid of the authority of your parents. Those people that consider me 'rebellious' (they don't even know me!) only because I'm a teenager set my nerves on edge!!! Brrr...I can't understand why people think that everybody in their teens is a rebel!. . BTW I quite agree with Amy Y.

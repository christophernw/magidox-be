We, all men and women, are "sons and daughters of God". Jesus happens to be the first spiritually born son of God, only son born in the flesh. Jesus was born into this world by an earthly Mother Mary and Heavenly Father God. As the literal offspring of God and only perfect person that has lived on earth, he was able to atone for our sins and provided for the resurrection of the world(just and unjust).

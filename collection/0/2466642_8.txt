I went to church this morning (not the Sunrise service though!  11am!) and had lunch with my parents.  In the evening I hung out with 8 of my friends and we played Three for All and just chatted about good memories we had from growing up together.  It had been a long time since we all got together so it was really nice.  We had our Easter family dinner Friday night.

You do not have to respect Christianity, or any other religion, just respect other people and their right to believe how they want.  I am not a Christian, however do believe that Jesus set a good example.  You will find hypocrites in every religion.  It seems that Christians are the only ones that believe they are right and everyone else is wrong, however, actions speak louder than words.  Some of the finest people I know (including myself) are not Christian, and try to respect all people.  The people that make those statements, pick and choose their own rules.  Their are many different versions of Christian religions, even they cannot agree with each other.  So do not accept pressure from them, keep questioning your own faiths, and do the right thing!!

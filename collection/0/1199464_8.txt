Firstly, I agree with Nlah, your terminology is inaccurate; the term is "homosexuality", not "homosexualism".  . . Secondly, to impose a restriction on heterosexuals NOT to practice what they consider to be a natural extension of their sexuality and sexual identity would be an inhumane and intolerable act, and you would be guilty of the very same scepter of oppression that homosexuals have been victimized by and tirelessly struggling to be liberated from throughout civilized Modernity.  To reverse the struggle, tit for tat, is cruelly unconscionable, and would pervert and skew the Golden Rule into "Do onto others as they have done onto you.". . Lastly, and personally, I feel your question feeds the flames of contra distinct opposition, and does not aid in nurturing comprehension of cultural differences and mutual similarities, which otherwise could bridge people together in mutual acceptance of their unique and novel difference.

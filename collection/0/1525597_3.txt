Okay good one. Hope you have an AV RECEIVER that is capable of decoding 7.1 channel sound. If you have one of those just go and plug all the satellites to the terminals located in the back of the AV RECEIVER and plug the sub woofer to the sub woofer terminal. Now set the phase control or just go and set the cut of frequency for the sub woofer, calibrate the overall soind and you are done. If you have an older 5.1 then you have to compromise on 2 satellites, or else go get an powered stereo amplifier and look if there is anyway you can connect it to av receiver and speakers. Hope that answers your question.

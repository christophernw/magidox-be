You should ask that question if you are not prepared to here the truth from your employer.  This may only cause you to have resentment for you employer and this may put your employer in a position to pay more attention to what you are doing and may even give him/her a reason to fire you.  If you are a strong person and think you will be able to handle the reason(s) you did not get the job, then go for it.  Who knows it might be a good reason why you did not get the job.....ie you maybe hard to replace and your employer finds that you are a good employee.  So don't look at it as something negative.

I agree with Clueless Sage. Dumbledore asked him to do it. But I'm still not sure weather I believe DD really is dead. The fact that the spell threw him backwards off the tower is strange, since it doesn't usually do that. And what happened to DD's wand? After he falls, it's never mentioned again. So..... all we can do now is wait for the 7th book and see. I'm sure it will all come clear.

you cant really stop dogs from shedding. This is a natural thing most dogs do. To prevent the shedded hair from getting all over your carpet and home, you can use a pet brush a few times a day instead of just letting the hair fall out on its own. You can trim the hair so there isnt so much to shed, and you can bathe the dog more often..if the dog is losing too much hair, it could be diet related and you might want to check with a vet.

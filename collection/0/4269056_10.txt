firstly your question is wrong. Potato is not boiled, it is cooked.. . salt is an impurity. Boiling point of water increses when an impurity is added to it.. . thus more time is needed for the water to boil, due to this more heat is supplied to the water and the potato.. . hence potato is cooked faster.

Jesus told us to pray the "Our Father" prayer and when we come to the part where we pray "Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us"....if we are unwilling to forgive others, we will not be forgiven.  Thats pretty clear.  We forgive not for the sake of others, but for ourselves so that we can find peace within ourselves, and know we can let go of anger, resentment, and the urge for vengence in our own hearts.  We do this through prayer, asking God to give us the grace to truly forgive others and He will do that for us.

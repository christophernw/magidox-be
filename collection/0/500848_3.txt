Why do bruises occur more frequently in somepeople than in others?. The injury required to produce a bruise varies withage. While it may take quite a bit of force to cause a bruisein a young child, even minor bumps and scrapes may cause extensivebruising or ecchymosis in an elderly person. Blood vessels becomemore fragile as we age and bruising may even occur without priorinjury in the elderly.. . The amount of bruising may also be affected by medicationswhich interfere with blood clotting (and thus cause more bleedinginto the skin or tissues). These drugs include many prescription arthritis medications called non-steroidal anti-inflammatories(e.g. ibuprofen/Advil, Nuprin and naproxen/Aleve ) as well asover-the-counter medications, such as aspirin. Warfarin (Coumadin)is often prescribed by doctors specifically to prevent clottingin patients who have had blood clots in their legs or heart. Warfarincan cause particularly severe bruising, especially if the levelof the medication becomes too high. Cortisone medications, suchas prednisone, promote bruising by increasing the fragility ofthe tiny blood vessels in the skin. In addition, patients withinherited clotting problems (such as in hemophilia) or acquiredclotting problems (such as in patients with liver diseases likecirrhosis), can develop extensive bruising or even life-threateningbleeding.

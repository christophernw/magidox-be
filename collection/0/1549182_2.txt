No one really knows where STDs come from. This is quite controversial. . . For example, did syphillis come from the New World? Or was it already present in the Old World?  Is it a mutation of the disease yaws? . . . Did gonorrhea come with the first invading Europeans to infect the natives in the Americas? It had been known for a long time in Europe, Asia and Africa. One of the references states:. . "Gonorrhea was described in early writings from Egypt, China, and Japan. Warnings against "unclean discharge from the body" appear in the Bible. A diagnostic description of the disease was written in the Middle Ages.". . Did AIDs result from a mutation of the Simian Immuodeficiency Virus (SIV)? Did it spread because of a polio vaccine program, or from a hunter consuming a primate with SIV? . . Chlamydia appears in avian and mammalian strains, and also appears to have been with humans a long time (see reference). Here is a quote from the reference below:. . "Descriptions of a "chlamydia-like" disease of human eyes resembling the disease now known as trachoma (meaning  'rough eye') have been found in ancient Chinese and Egyptian manuscripts.". . Bacterial STDs can be treated with various antibiotics, although some of these are becoming resistant to antibiotic measures. Viruses like HIV are kept in check by a cocktail of different drugs like AZT, 3TC and efavirenz. Syphylis used to be treated with mercury compounds, and Salvarsan (see references) before antibiotics.

The thing that worked best for me was to record myself giving a speech, and then to play it back to count the times I "ahh"'d or "umm"'d.  Not only did recording the speech give me practice, but it also provided an opportunity for me to hear how badly my speech sounded when I filled quiet space with meaningless noise.  Once you've listened to yourself take note of the places you add the Ummm's most, and spend some more time studying that area until you know it without a hitch - re-record over and over until you are certain of your material.  Once you know your material, confidence replaces fear, and you'll get through your speech without UMMMMM's.

Let's explain pidginize first. It comes from the term pidgin, a contact language (usually spontaneous) that is essentially a mixture of two or more languages. On the whole, pidgin languages have simple grammar and vocabulary. (Think of Spanglish - the language, not the film - as a popular example of this.) They are meant to be a functional (in the strictest sense) form of communication between two groups. To pidginize, then, is two mix two or more languages together to create a new language which facilitates communication.. . Creolization is a related term in sociolinguistics. The key to the difference is to point out that pidgins are not native (first)languages (by definition!). They are learned, secondary languages. Once the subsequent generations of the pidgin speakers learn the pidgin language as their first language (the pidgin itself becomes more complex) and the native language of the community, it is said that creolization has occurred.. . That is all I can remember! It has been a long while since my last linguistics class!

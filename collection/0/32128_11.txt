What a short sighted and unfeeling attitude.. Look at the problems that disabled people and their carers have to cope with.I'm sure they would gladly sacrifice the benfits and help they get to be able to work,care and live as others do.. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say you hadn't thought this question through,whilst i suspect that this question is probably based on the fact that you had trouble getting a parking space in town today.. . Just seen your adendum.So i was right! HA HA HA !

Why would someone else do it? To lay blame on the Russians is a weak answer. He was much more of an asset alive to all countries. He never spoke harshly of anyone except russia. As a living advocate of anti-putkin beliefs, he was a threat to who? US? nope. UK? nope. hmmm that would leave only one other country to blame. And that country would be the one who has used assassination as a way of political life for over 100 years. Radiation poisoning is almost untraceable. Much better than a bullet. If he had been killed in russia it would have probably been a bullet. plus remember this guy was a trained KGB agent. He would probably be prepared for most normal types of assassination. Yep russia did it but it will never been proven. You have always been such a russia supporter, I can't see why you are not happy with the fact that russia will get away with this? It is something they finally got good at.

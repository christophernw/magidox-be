You have to worship in the way that feels right for you.. I am Jewish - yet going to a synagogue bores me.. . The reason for this is because I am an extravert. A quiet silent prayer means nothing to me.. . I have to stand on a hill top, look up and open up.. . It took me a long time to find the best way for me to worship. I hope you find your way quicker - and religion doesn't have to come into it.. . As far as I'm concerned it's as simple as this.. There is a God - and there is me.. . Nothing else matters.. You don't need any Jesus, Mohammed or anyone else.. If you try hard enough, you can open up a direct line.

Left handed people use the right side of their brain to perform tasks such as writing, because the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body, and the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body.. . I've heard that some, but not all, left handed people have their speech centers in different locations than most right handed people.. . If a person switches their hand of dominance, for example, a left handed person starts writing with their right hand, they will eventually use both sides of their brain to perform this task.

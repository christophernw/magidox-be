Many people lack wisdom and understanding.  They lack knowledge about science and biology.  They lack exposure to the various cultures that exist and make the world as interesting as it is.  They create laws to elevate, isolate and overrate themselves.  They feel need for these laws because they lack self confidence, personal integrity and the ability to accept the responsibility for their own actions.  Unfortunately for everyone, that is why there are sitll racists.

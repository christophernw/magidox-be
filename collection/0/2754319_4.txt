Why do people who don't believe in a religion feel the need to express their opinion?  If a person wants both secular and Christian answers, they'll specify.  It's like a person asking a question specific to engineers and ME answering it.  It doesn't make sense.  . . Anyway, there's something in the Bible about all thoughts being of God or something.  It's late and I don't feel like looking it up, but if you think about it, anything not done to glorify God would be a waste of time (and glorifying God can be done in many ways, including helping others).  Plus idleness is like the gateway drug to really messing up.  :P

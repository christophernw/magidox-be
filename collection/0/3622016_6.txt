There are two types of liars; those who lie because they are selfish and will lie to get what they want regardless, and those who feel telling the truth may cause pain and greater anguish to those around them. Lying is unfortunately a part of human nature. I think we've all told a lie at some point in  our lives, even if it is a small one. But, what people need to remember is, is the lie going to do more damage than good.

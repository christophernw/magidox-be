There is no evidence to support macro evolution which I am sure would have been quite a topic for Moses with God.  The 6 day creation is perfectly valid and logical for the formation of the earth, universe, etc.. . Daily, there are news reports refuting evolution and supporting an earth that is about 6,000 years old rather than millions.. . Lastly, even evolution doesn't address creation.

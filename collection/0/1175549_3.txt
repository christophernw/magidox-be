Well, since you have a college degree, I would advise not saying anything about the stripper experience at all. My advice would be to go out and get some rinky-dink job for a few months (even flipping burgers) just to say that you have SOME work experience without listing the other, slightly more embarassing job.. . Having a little experience that you aren't embarassed to talk to your employer about plus the college degree ought to really help you out. Good luck on your career change!

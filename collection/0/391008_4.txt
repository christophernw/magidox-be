No, not lack of calcium,that is a myth my mom used to use to get me to drink white milk.  The "spots" are places on the nail where it is detaching from the nail bed. That happens when you bang your nail against something.  I think it can also mean dehydration. I'm not a nail expert though , I think I would look it up to see.They grow out though, so nothing to worry about.  There is a "natural" white spot on the bace of your nail. It is called the lunula, but I don't really know what it does (if it does anything at all).

If I knew in person...I would've slap you across your face 20 times for sayin that. I'm not Chinese but I hate it when people act like looks are everything and they act like asian people are suppose to be nerds and smart. Dumbasses these days. People are people and they all act differently and its not their fault ok? So quit hating on asians! If they're still young...dont worry about it, they'll grow into it and if they're older and mature...who cares??! Its not like you're going to marry them or something...leave them alone :D

Well pal, our brains like it in our pants because unlike women we think logically, clinically and with steely decision.  To do that, we need a quiet, remote, dark place which by default, lies in our pants.   Actually, it's all down to the "Y FRONT" syndrome where comfort and support reign supreme.  Also common to the "Y FRONT" syndrome is that if you scratch around long enough, something always comes to hand, or crops up or comes to a head.  At least by having their brains in their pants, men can palpitate their cerebral hemispheres with ease, unlike women whose brains remain buried deep below their temporal lobes.

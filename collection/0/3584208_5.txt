Maybe it's for the ppl with feet fetish, the feel of real leather! And after spending thousands on a suite, would you let someone with boots or golf shoes on anywhere near the new leather sofa? I wouldn't!. . Anyway I think it's more comfortable without socks. I get barefoot as soon as I get home from work, and I don't have a leather sofa either!

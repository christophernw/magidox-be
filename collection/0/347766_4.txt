i know what ur talking about..everyone had their little glitches in front of an audience..i tend to shke my fooot..? lol..what you have to do to overcome ur habbit of blushing in front of the class room is just to take a deep breath and be calm about the situation..dont think that everyone is looking at you..u have to pretend that u are alll allone and practing it to ur self out loud..it sounds weird but it works..anything taht takes ur mind off of ur presentation is good..that way u dont get neverus about presenting and start bugging out and blushing..works for me..good luck=)

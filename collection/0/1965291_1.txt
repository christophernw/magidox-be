and MP3 player is a digital music player.  the most common of course is the iPod.  You put music on your computer from CD's you own or Song you pay money to download off of iTunes, and you hook your MP3 player to your computer via a USB cable and put the music on the MP3 player from your computer.  You can then walk around with your MP3 player and a pair of headphones and listen to your music wherever you go, and with the right adapter you can listen in the car.  MP3 players are not made for games at all, but the newly released iPod actually comes with some games such as Tetris and Solitaire.  iPod's range from about 100 bucks to 400 bucks, depending on the hard drive size you buy.  The bigger the hard drive, the more music you can have with you at all times.  That's an MP3 player.  Hope this helps.

My brother has bipolar disorder, too, and I don't think it's something you can get rid of completely. But you can treat it if you talk to a doctor (neurological... or maybe a psychiatrist would know where to go), and they'll help you find medicine or whatever you need. My brother used to be really bad, but he's so much better now that he has the right medicine. Goodluck~

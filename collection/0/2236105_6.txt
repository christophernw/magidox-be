“Intelligent Design” is a less-scientific repackaging of the “Creationism” ideas pushed back in the 1980’s; and I say it is less scientific because the 1980’s version contained testable statements about the age of the Earth and the deposition of sediments – they were testable, they were tested, they were proved false.. . No other scientific theory has been put forth that explains “how we got here” better than evolution – science, by definition, involves testable hypotheses – thus, the currently popular “Intelligent Design” idea (which has quite a few flaws, check out the link below to the Dover, PA trial about the biology “disclaimer”).

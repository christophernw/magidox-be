Some of those answers really surprised me. I'm a Christian, and if my child was gay I would do all I could to nurture and be there for them. I can't say I would support the lifestyle, because I wouldn't. However, they would still be my child and I would love them unconditionally. It is ultimately their decision to live life how they choose, not mine.

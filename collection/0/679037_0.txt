yes I sure do have an opinion on this.... the media is an extremely strong influence on girls and women's body image. they set the tone on what is in fashion , what the norm is, and what is considered attractive. this causes girls/women to constantly strive to reach this unattainable goal, starving themselves leading to bulimia and anorexia and even suicide...it destroys their self esteem...the image the media represents is not even the average person, its of an emaciated individual passed off as a  model of the ideal  female body.....this influence is now spreading to the males as well, with boys also  developing eating disorders... this influence destroys self confidence...and leads to life time  inner struggle..

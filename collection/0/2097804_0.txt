It's rightfully theirs.. God told them to do it and promised the land to their forefather, Abraham.. Today the Palestinians claim that it is their land based on the fact that the "Canaanites" were supposedly Arabs. This is not true. Noah had three sons, one of whom was Shem. From Shem came the Arabs and the Jews. The Canaanites were Hamites, or descendants of Noah's son Ham, so they were NOT Arabs.. There is no living people now that can rightfully fight the Jews for that land. The Canaanites are gone and so are their descendants, therefore the land belongs to the Jews.

Practice Yoga Nidra in the mornings and the evenings. You can't change your husband, but you can change yourself. This will bring you piece of mind. Living with liars is "crazy-making." For your self and the sake of being a good role model to your children, practice something that will bring truth to your family.  Good luck!

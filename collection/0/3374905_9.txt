Ok, I think what it is is people freak out sometimes. We forget that we are all just people. We are the same species. People go over the top with trying to convert you into their religion because they are blinded by their faith, and are not aware that what they are doing is wrong. All you can do is look them in the eye and tell them where you are coming from, and be polite about it, and respect their stance if they have one. Just respect them regardless of what religion they are. Good brotherly love, respect, and understanding conquers all. We are all human beings and we should treat each other as so.

Because no other religions that I know of REQUIRE its members to mission door-to-door. Those do. It's actually a reward to be able to mission door-to-door in some of those afore mentioned religions. Personally, I wouldn't bother going door to door spouting my own beliefs because It's not my job to save the world.

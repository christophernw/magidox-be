If you aren't used to walking that much...yes.  Any boost in your activity level will help speed up your metabolism if you are normally sedentary.. . My husband just changed jobs...his previous one was relatively active but it was in a small place so he didn't really have to walk far to do anything.  His new job is in a huge place and he has to walk nearly a mile just to pee.  He took my pedometer to work and found that he is walking an average of about 8 miles every day.  Since February he has lost 30 pounds.

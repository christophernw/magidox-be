Science is obviously a very needed couse.  Technology is also huge.  At my hospital, we chart on computers and it is much easier to get this done if you know atleast the basics of using a computer-some of the older nurses have problems with this.  Society is also a much needed class.  It helps you to broaden your spectrum.

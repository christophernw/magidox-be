My question for you would be, do you wrap the other foods that are in your freezer?  If they are tightly wrapped then the flavors shouldnt transfer at all, everything should be frozen and not put off any oder.  Perhaps the smell you have in your freezer is from the freezer itself, baking soda is a wonderful idea, but its only a bandaid to the problem.  Thaw out the freezer and wipe it down with Soft-Scrub or some other non abrasive scrubbing agent. Bleach would work, but talk about an oder!  If you continue to have problems with odors in your freezer, you might check to make sure it is freezing properly, frozen foods shouldnt smell of anything but ice and cold air.  If things appear okay and it still doesnt satisfy the problem, change your ice trays out, it may just be a smell in the plastic that is transfering.

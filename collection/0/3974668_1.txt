Nope.. F*ck a cold, sweat a fever.. Seriously - sure-fire fever breaker:  Crawl under the heaviest blanket you have and sleep until the weird fever-dreams stop.. Just be mentally prepared for the weirdest few hours of your life.. Your body has turned up the heat in order to create a hostile environment for that virus or whatever...  Use the next few hours or whatnot to cook that sh*t outta your system.

basically ralph is the good guy and jack is the bad guy.. jack is the anti-thesis in this novel. everything that ralph is trying to keep in peace and try to be civilized jack tries to ruin and take over, leaving us with the good guy-bad guy scenario.. Jack leads by intimidation, Ralph is a natural leader.. Jack wants power because he had it back in private school, Ralph doesn't even really want power but deals well with it.. Jack takes over by brutality, whereas Ralph deals with it mostly by compassion.. BUT they both are guilty of wanting power, just Jack takes it more to an extreme than the other.. Hope this helps!!. <3

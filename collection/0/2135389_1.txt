Luther did not successfully challenge the RC church.  When he posted the 95 Theses on the Wittenburg door, he fully expected to have a civil debate among other monks and priests about his ideas.  No one would debate him.  Luther got shut out of the church and excommunicated.  So he married and started a new life.  He and his successors (all monks or priests) founded the Reformation.  . . The long term effects would include anything involving Protestantism, to which some attribute modern democracy, capitalism, and individualism.

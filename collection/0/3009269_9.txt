Civil liability, is the reason some police departments have policies of not dealing with immigration issues.  Just like Border Patrol Agents not having peace officer authority.  Border Patrol Agents are not trained in peace officer laws, rules and regulations.  If it doesn't deal with immigration or other laws that I have delegated authority, I don't get involved.  Too many greedy people read to sue for civil rights violations.  I want to live a happy life and not worry about being sued.  I walk the straight line!

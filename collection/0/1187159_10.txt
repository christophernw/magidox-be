Well for a Christian this simply means that the Long awaited Days of Total Peace and Joy and the end of all sorrows is comming soon. They will get to be with Jesus their savior. The one who they live their lives here on earth for. Kinda like Stepping out of a Filthy nasty sewer that they have been trapped in forever and into clean fresh running water never to see or smell the sewer again.

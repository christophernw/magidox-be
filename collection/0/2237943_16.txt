First ; WE THE PEOPLE - live in a  democracy where freedom reigns!  What is the big hoorah?  The government makes $$$$ in tabacco taxes. I am a smoker and to some degree I understand the smoking in restaurants due to children and expecting mothers but in bars???  come on it is all adults who are there to get their drink on and what is a drink without a cig. BORING! . . SECOND: We The People - are going to lose our freedom, our rights, and our democracy status  the ban on smoking started in a small area and now it is nation wide and beyond ( Castro banned cigar smoking in public areas) go figure!  The ignorant are all proud of the ban success which is leading to what is now-pro-life vs pro-choice-. In South Dakota the Governor banned abortions and any doctor caught performing one will automatically serve 5 years in prison. now wait-the law there stipulates that a woman can ONLY have an abortion if it is life threatening to her.  If she becomes pregnant by rape or incest then she must carry the baby to term!!!!!!. WE woman are still considered second class citizens what the hell will we become if we are stripped of our rights!!!!!  TO CHOOSE.  WAKE UP PEOPLE we the people are fading. 1st smoking now our bodies.. we live in AMERICA we are free to choose what is best for us!!!  "-look beyond the smoke sreen-"

Being a waitress myself quite a few years ago, I know that you can give really great service and still get a lousy tip. Most of the time, I found that the people that tip lousy are the ones that have the money and think that waitressing/bartending is just a lower class job. I disagree. When you are in this type of business, you have to always strive to do your best and not let the lousy tipper get you done even if it is disappointing. As for Streeter Mark, it takes alot more time than 4 minutes to serve a customer. From the time they sit down in your section to the time they leave, if you are any kind of waiter/waitress, you will be attentive to your customers until they leave that table. Even if it means just refilling water or coffee, or if they engage you in a conversation, not just being short with them. You need to be personable and be able to anticipate the customers needs before they ask for it. That does take a little bit of brains to do so. And by the way, being a server of any kind is not a degrading job, at least that person is working and not mooching off the system and if it wasn't for them, you wouldn't have a restaurant or a bar to go to since there wouldn't be anyone to serve you. You go bartender and do your thing and you'll get the good tippers and the bad too. Take it with a grain of salt and just do your job well. By the way, I tip on the quality of service I get. i.e.- if I have to ask for my drink to be refilled, or to have the dishes removed, etc.

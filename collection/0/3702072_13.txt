I ask this same question once in a meditation. The answer came clear as a bell.. . It said I have placed you here to learn the true meaning of Love. What ever it was that was answering then told me something that really set me back. It said that I felt the way I did about certain people because I did not understand the true meaning of love. I protested and said that I did my best to love all of . the people who were deserving of love.. . It replied "yes that is, youâ€™re misunderstanding. You see love as something . that you dole out in tiny little portions here and there to people who you . have judged to be worthy of it. This is not love at all, it is only . judgment". This stopped me dead in my tracks. I suddenly realized that what . it was saying to me was true. This realization brought me to tears. It went . on and told me, "You treat love as though there is some shortage of it. It . is not something that you can run out of. The more love that you give, the . more love that there is in the world. Its that simple. The only way that . there can be a shortage of it is if you hoard it and keep it to yourself.". . It went on to explain, that "this is what Jesus was trying to tell you when . he asked you to turn the other cheek, to judge not and to love your . neighbor. He made no exceptions in these things that he requested of you. . Why are you making exceptions, and judging some as worthy of love and others . as not? Jesus fully intended for you to apply this love that you are to all, . in a universal manner without any judgment of any sort". By this time the tears . Were flowing so freely. I was crying because for the first time in my life I . Understood what the message Jesus left for us in the bible actually meant.. . This has become my truth. I can't say what yours is for sure, but I have a feeling that it is probably similar.. . Love and blessings. don

Beauty is being yourself and never backing down in what you believe, having said that it does not make it right to push your beliefs on others as many people do on this thing. It is one thing to have an opinion but it is not okay to impose it on anyone that is beauty. fake people who are so insecure about themselves that they have to justify their own thoughts and beliefs by putting down all others who do not believe. that is very sad. I dont like it when people imose on me and I sure dont like fake people. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. beauty is confidence.

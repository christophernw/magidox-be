Personally, I believe in civil liberties (free speech, right to practice whichever religion you choose, etc.), the right to universal health care, strong family values (being a good parent and raising your child in an emotionally, physically, educationally, and financially stable environment), equal education for ALL, and protecting jobs for Americans (no outsourcing, keeping jobs in America, workers' rights, etc.). . . My significant other is in Baghdad at the moment and I support him with all my heart. I'm not a "baby-killer" and I'm VERY straight. BUT... I believe that the war in Iraq is unfounded, I believe in a couple's right to choose, and I believe that marriage is about love,  honor, respect and loyalty (not about gender). And I've never burned a flag. I don't do drugs, I pay my taxes, I volunteer with youth groups, and I'm not racist, sexist, or xenophobic. So... for all those people that say "liberal values" mean being immoral... they're sorely mistaken.. . I believe that everyone deserves equal grounds to stand on - quality affordable healthcare, a decent education, and the ability to access jobs within the American workforce without having to worry about being pink-slipped because a company has found cheaper labor outside of our country. What's wrong with that?

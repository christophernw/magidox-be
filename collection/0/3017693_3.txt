The whole world may be right.. . Perhaps we should reduce the motivation for people to sneak across the border.  Realize, that 99.99% of the illegals coming across the border are just coming here for a job.  They're ready to work hard, to send money back to their families.  How much of a problem is this really? . . If we expanded our guest worker program, and started to crack down on business that hire illegals (but allowed them to apply to hire guest workers), this could all be done above board... and taxed!  So- it would become a revenue source, rather than drain.. . Silly Americans.  This country was built on immigration!  But the natural bigotism of the small minded takes over.

To make life important.. . That's off of Six Feet Under.. . We die because our bodies are like machines that eventually, or instantly break down.  Just like a machine with a broken part, our bodies cannot function properly or sustain themselves forever.  They just get worn out.. . PS. It has nothing to do with Adam & Eve.  sigh.

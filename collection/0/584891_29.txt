i think it is just the way jk rowling would have wanted it. she loves to twist everything around but somehow i think that there is going to be a surprise. a real big surprise. except perhaps that it would much more involve snape and dumbledore rather than sirius black cause that guy is truly dead. even though he is a death eater he is also actually a traitor, he is working for dumbledore. trust me there is going to be a surprise.

It is awesome that you have that question! I have been praying for my brother for a very long time. His wife and son attend church, but he never went with them. It really upset myself and my sister-in-law, but he's not the kind to discuss it with him.. He called last night and we talked of the Lord, tithing, baptism, the Bible...it was awesome! I think the Lord is working in his life!! But I give all the glory to God, and that is how the Lord works through prayer! God Bless you!

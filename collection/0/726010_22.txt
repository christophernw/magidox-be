A porcelain fixture that catches and flushes human waste is a toilet, and I think that's what Americans call them. Are you talking about a toilet or a toilet room? Or are they one and the same where you come from?. . Many Americans are shy about saying why they need the toilet room. Maybe they need the actual toilet, maybe not. Maybe they want to blow their nose, hike up their pantyhose, etc. The whole idea of having a private area is just that- it is private. A person shouldn't have to announce their specific plans.

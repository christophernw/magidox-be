This assumes that Homosexuals aren't God's children, which if I recall correctly, all of human kind supposedly is.  Anyways, the rainbow is representative of diversity, which is why they use it.  Besides, there are plenty of homosexuals who believe in God.  I've met many of them.  I've met a transexual who is a devote believer and I am reminded of the fallen woman being brought before Jesus and the Pharasees trying to get him to say that she should be stoned, as it was according to Jewish Law.  And Jesus said "ok, fine do that... but let he who is without sin cast the first stone..."  Try thinking about why he said that...

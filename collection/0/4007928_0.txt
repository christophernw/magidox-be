E = mc2 is one of the most famous equations, even to non-physicists, and which states a relationship between energy (E), in whatever form, and mass (m). In this formula, cÂ², the square of the speed of light in a vacuum, is the conversion factor required to formally convert from units of mass to units of energy, i.e. the energy per unit mass. In unit specific terms, E (joules) = M (kilograms) multiplied by (299792458 m/s)2.

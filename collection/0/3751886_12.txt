cos they f*cking think they invented hot water. fact is, I live in Spain, and every time I get an American customer in the shop (and that's 5 or 6 times a week), they all go bla bla bla I need a 5 inch this and a 3/4 that, and then they look all amazed when you ask them what that is in centimeters and millimeters. with an attitude like "duh, dude, we are American citizens, you have to do the maths for us, not the other way around." damn freak show anyways, the Americans. most off them as fat as a human being can get lol

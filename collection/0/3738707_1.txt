Mysore is a city in the south of India where Ashtanga yoga has been taught by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois since the 1930's. This traditional style of Mysore has students learn postures in a fixed order using a special movement-breathing technique called vinyasa. The vinyasa links the postures together in the dance of the breath.

If people would "live and let live", and not shove their religion in other people's faces (regardless of their church denomination), then atheists (and others) would not respond.  It's pretty simple ... don't throw junk in somebody's back yard, and you won't get it thrown back!. . How many church denominations are there?  There are many, many different churches.   And yet they all have their own particular beliefs (or else they would not be separate from others).  Many of them don't agree with others who have similar beliefs, so if a person doesn't want to be told what to believe, then that should be respected.  Not everybody wants to be controlled by a group who tells everybody how to live or wants their money (and money is a HUGE part of this.). . I never have Hindu or Muslim folks try to convert me, but yet the fundies feel it is their duty to nag others until they convert.  It would be the same if someone of an entirely different religion tried to convert them -- they would have no time for it and they would respond.

If you mean premature ejaculation I can answer.. it is usual that it will come some drops out of your penis a while before you reach orgasm&#92;ejaculate. I think it does to most men.. If you have premature ejaculation, you will ejaculate almost immediately after you get hard. Like in the movie American Pie if you have seen it.

The greed of the oil companies. Have you ever noticed how frequently the price of gas changes? At least 3 or maybe 4 times a day. Did you know that most gas stations fill up their storage tanks once a week? Why, then, do gas prices fluctuate so dramatically and frequently? Greed is the only answer I can think of, though I'm open to other answers. The price of gas is fixed according to the fluctuating price of crude, not to the actual cost -plus a small profit- of the fuel supplied. The governments may not call this price gouging and price fixing, but I sure do. Don't you?

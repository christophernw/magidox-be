Are you using the coconut flakes that comes in a bag found in the baking aisle?. . This is how i do mine put the coconut flakes in a Ziploc bag add a couple of drops of food coloring and shake the bag, if you want the color to be darker just add more color to it, when it's the color that you want spread the coconut in a cookie sheet and just let it dry for a few minutes. This is great when your making an edible grass.

Your sweet little kitten needs specific kitten nutrition just for her.  I suggest putting her on Kitten Chow until she's about 6 months old.  She will be growing at a fast pace and will need all the minerals and vitamins supplied in that food. It's also coated with a milky residue that kittens like.  Once she reaches 6 months of age, you can gradually introduce her to Cat Chow.  If you want to feed her a cat food that is less expensive, mix it into the Cat Chow little by little until she is eating nothing but the cheaper version.  But make sure that the cat food has the recommended amounts of vitamins and minerals she needs.. . I would refrain from feeding your kitten (cat) table food.  Sure, it they might like it better, but it isn't the healthy choice for them.  It can also create a dependency to table food, to the point that they won't eat their cat food and don't get the nutrition they need.  There are, however, cat treats out on the market that you can give her .... on occasion.. . Good luck with your little one!  I hope she brings you lots of joy and companionship!  Cats are fun and AWESOME !!!

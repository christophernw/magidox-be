You lose a lot of water when you urinate. You also lose water when you breathe. You can even see some of the water you lose when you breathe out (exhale) on a mirror. You also lose some water when you exercise and sweat. Your sweat cools your muscles down so that your body temperature doesn't get above 98.6 degrees F. It is especially important to remember to drink plenty of water on hot and humid days to help keep your body cool so you don't get heat exhaustion and get sick. . . How do you know if you are drinking enough water? The amount of water you need to drink every day depends upon your age and size, but one easy way to tell, is to look at your urine. If it is bright yellow in color, then it is time to drink more water. If your urine is almost clear or very pale yellow, then you may be drinking enough. Remember to drink water before you exercise and about every 15 minutes during exercise and hard play.

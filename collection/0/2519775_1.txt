Morality, properly viewed and pursued, will indicate to you the rightness or wrongness of your reasons, directions, and progress towards your beliefs, actions, and purposes, but it won't tell you what is, isn't, should be, or should not be acceptable.. . Morality is NOT about "right and wrong."  It's about proper identification of causes and effects how ever many there may be to whatever degree/power from one point of reference to another.. . Your ethics are like policy decisions you have made (even by default) about what is/is not acceptable in a world of living creatures, and are likely based upon / fueled by (not "dictated to") your view of morality at work in all that reality out there.. . Morality exists independent of ethics.. Ethics depends upon morality (whether, or how well, you see it or not).

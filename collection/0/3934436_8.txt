In the King James Version of the Bible the word "paradise" is used three times.  All three usages are in the New Testament.  The word is of Persian origin, and has reference to a garden.. . The three times the word "paradise" is used it appears to mean somewhat different things.  To the thief on the cross Jesus said, "This day shalt thou be with me in paradise."  But this place was not heaven because Jesus did not go to heaven (the place where God dwells) until at least three days later.  Paradise in this case referred to a place of waiting.  A pleasant place, to be sure.. . The other usages of the word "paradise" in the New Testament seem to refer to a heaven like place, and to a heavenly garden like place.  "Heaven" also is used in various ways, including the sky and the place where God dwells.

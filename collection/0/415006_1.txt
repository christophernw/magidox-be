Go to the library and look it up in the Chiltons manual. You can make copies and bring them home with you. It depends on the vehicle of couse but it can be hard to separate the lower ball join because it's pressed in. They sell specialized presses to do this job, it's like a heavy duty "C" clamp with special fittings. After I took the cotter pin and bolt off I set up a puller on it to try and push it out but it wouldn't budge. So, with the pressure on it I hit the lower control arm with a long drift and a light sledge hammer and eventually it popped out. The second time I did this job I borrowed a ball joint press and it was a lot easier. This is not an easy job but I've done it twice. It took me 4 hours 2 days in a row to change all four ball joints on my '91Ranger. It was worth it though, the truck felt brand new afterwards.

Classically (which is the best place to start), the basic principle is the universal law of gravitation which states that all point particles are attracted to each other with a force proportional to the product of their masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The proportionality constant is determined empirically by measuring it for a special case (aka the Cavendish experiment).. . General relativity provides a more general framework to describe gravity, but if you're going to be asking about such things as "forces" (a classical concept), you'd better focus on classical gravity for now.

The Catholic Church believes that "Only God forgives sin.". . When a penitent person asks God for forgiveness, his (or her) sins are immediately forgiven.. . Catholics also believe that when someone sins they not only hurt their relationship with God, they also injure the entire church, the body of Christ. The Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation not only reconciles the sinner to God but with the entire church, including you and me.. . Penance is an internal conversion of heart toward God and away from sin, which implies the intention to change one's life because of hope in divine mercy. External acts of penance include fasting, prayer, and almsgiving.. . With love in Christ.

I wouldn't expect it to last very long.. I would expect it to get eaten away bit by bit until it blows again.. I guess the engine needs stripping so that it can be machined, but is it the cylinder head that is damaged or the cylinder block. They must have taken the head off to put in the sealer, so I guess it must be the block..  If its only the head, it shouldn't be too much of a job.

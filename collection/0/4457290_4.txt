The Christian story is described by some scholars as "the Christian mythos" for precisely the reasons you've outlined above. Not all Christians are Biblical literalists, and do understand the mythical aspects of Christianity. There are many religious writers, such as John Shelby Spong, who have long since dispensed with the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection. However, many other Christians do take it all quite literally, and were likely raised to equate the term "myth" with "falsehood", instead of understanding the connection between the Christian story and earlier pre-Christian narratives.

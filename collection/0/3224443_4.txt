In ancient times, it was customary to congratulate someone who just. sneezed, because sneezing was viewed as the body's way to expel evil. spirits.  This view may have been based on the observation that. people sneeze more often when they are ill, and illness was thought. to be caused by evil spirits.. . In the fourteenth century, the black plague came to Europe. accompanied by violent sneezing among those afflicted.  The Pope. passed a law that anyone who sneezed was to be blessed by those. nearby, with the hope that death might be averted.  Today, most. people still say "Bless you!" when someone sneezes.. . The Germans were a bit less religious about their sneezing customs.. To this day, they say "gesundheit" [geh-ZUND-hyt] after someone. sneezes, which simply means "good health."

I think you should at least listen to your friend and give her a chance to explore what she believes.  Perhaps there is something you can learn by reading the Bible.  Are you afraid of the Bible?  Just asking!  Why do you feel the need to push her away.  I am sure she would listen to you, if she's really a Christian, even if you don't believe as she does.  Jesus is coming soon!  She probably loves you enough that she doesn't want you to miss out on a relationship with God.  That is pretty COOL!!!!  Give it time and jkeep the lines of communication open please.

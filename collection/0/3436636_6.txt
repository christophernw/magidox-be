There are many religions. There is only one Christ. He said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life and no man comes to the Father except by Me." Christians are taught that we have all sinned [been disobedient in some way] and we need to be restored to a relationship with the God who created us. Jesus is the go-between. He sacrificed His life for ours. To come to Him we must admit that we have sinned and need salvation.  Christianity is about faith in Jesus Christ.It is not a religion but a relationship with the "one true thin."  Jesus said "I am the Truth."

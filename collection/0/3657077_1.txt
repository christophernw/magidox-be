You might have to drill several pilot holes first. For instance if the finished hole you want is 1/2", start with a 1/16" drill. Then step up to 1/8" drill and so on until you finally drill 1/2". Also, try drilling at as high an rpm as your drill will allow and drill with slow, light and steady pressure. If possible, after your first small pilot hole is drilled, drill halfway from each side with all your remaining drills. This might help prevent the material from cracking because you are not drilling all the way through, instead you are drilling halfway in from both sides. I hope that makes sense.

Gay people don't contract HIV any easier, it just so happens that the first breakout was within the homosexual community.  Heterosexual females between the ages of 18 - 25 are the largest growing population in North American at the moment contracting HIV.  If you look at the African continent HIV/AIDS is rampant and not in the "Gay" community.  Anyone who still feels that HIV is a "Gay" disease is very closed minded and this closed mindness is what is not stopping the HIV/AIDS virus.  Oh and for one of the other answers being gay is not wrong (and I'm not gay by the way)

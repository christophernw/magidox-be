Haha.  My dog does the same thing.  i know thats not funny because i lost 5 pairs over the summer.  We got this bitter apple spray.  We spray whenever we see somethign that has been chewed up or when she is in the process of it.  Good luck if you find somethinng else that really works tell me please.<3

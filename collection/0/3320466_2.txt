SR  ( serious risk ) 22 is an insurance policy for bad drivers.. . I had to buy that type policy when I was 19. Generally it is for accidents and driving drunk and wreckless driving .  "AND" Driving without a license or driving with a revoked license.. . Do shop around when you buy the insurance cuz some companies can take month to month payments. some can do quarterly payments. It will cost a lot more than a good driver

English should be an official language of this country. It is unpractical and wasting money by printing election materials in other languages as they do now. If you print one other language, you should print all  other languages in order to be fair.  If any immigrant does not want to learn English, he has no intention to be assimilated into American society. Then he should leave or stay as resident, not citizen.

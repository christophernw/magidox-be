global warming is no threat to the planet.  the Earth has went through this change before.  global warming and global cooling. right now we are going to the warm side but after that we will go to the cool side of things.  this is a natural thing (we might have hastened it a little, not much tho).  the only thing that is different is what we are here, and we think that what we live in now is normal.  the Truth is that we have no idea what NORMAL is.  we do not live long enough to experience a full cycle.

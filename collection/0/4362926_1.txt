And if you can't ask them (if they are dead, for instance), you can check public records in the county they likely had the baby in.  Depending on when the person (might have) had the baby, you can check census records as well.  I think there's a 60-70 seal on census records, though.  (so 1950's census wouldn't be available for instance, but I think 1920's are).

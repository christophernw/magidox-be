Well when you fight a war against terrorists and insurgents who don't wear uniforms so they can't be identified.  Plus they hide behind things like improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) where they blow you up from a distance.  How would you want to fight?. . The thing is there will always be improvements in weapon technology.  Such things will continue to become more precise and deadly.  . . Imagine if we didn't use pressision guided bombs.  Imagine the civilian death count then.  . . The enemy fears us because they know we can see in the night, they know we can place a heat round through that truck he is using to transport mortar rounds from several kilometers away.

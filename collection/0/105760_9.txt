because he really is.. . No offense, I am a catholic but after having a discussion about the radical bible, I now believe that the God catholics we catholics are refering to is dead.. . The idea of having God in heaven, creates a distance between him and the believers. It makes God unreachable. The reason why we are indifferent. I do believe that that God in heaven who waits for us is already dead.. . The true God who is still alive is the one who is with us everyday. The one who is being refered to in the footprints on the sand. the one who is with us, inspires us, guides us, copmforts us, protects us.. . I am not anti-Christ. I truly believe in him just not as the person in heavens but who goes with me everyday. Carries me when I am in  burden and comforts me when in pain. The God who is alive is in me. Empowers me.

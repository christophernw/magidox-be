Both of the previous are correct about applying heat to loosen the adhesive, but I personally prefer the use of denatured alcohol to remove any remaining adhesive. It definitely will not cause color change. It can be obtained in any hardware store or hardware sections at some department stores. This is also a good product to use in removal of stains from fabrics such as carpeting as well.

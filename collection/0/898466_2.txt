This happens to me as well. I went to the doctor to find out why and this is what he told me. When your in an air conditioned room it's cold. (Duh) You get use to the cold air then when you have to go outside it's hot. Your going from one extremee to the other and your body doesn't have a chance to get use to the extrem temp. change. Thats why you'll feel it in your nose, ears and throught. You should go to the doctor anyway and check that out if it occurs after the summer time as well.

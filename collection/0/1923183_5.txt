Girl, I don't blame you. Being a kid is so much fun. You can play on the swings, slides, monkey bars, jump rope, hide-n-seek and people will think it's cute...but when you become an adult our lives are so consumed to graduate from school, go find a job, and pay bills...yuck!...sigh I wanna be a kid again...sigh

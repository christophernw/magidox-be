It was the Holy Spirit who impregnated her. After she had Jesus, she went on to have other children (at this time, she would not have been considered a virgin anymore, as I'm sure you've guessed!). This was not a normal birth, as it was God coming down to earth to live among man. Thus, she remained a virgin when she had Jesus, because it was God who made her pregnant with Him. This acts as proof that Jesus was the Son of God, being that it was the only birth in which the woman was still a virgin! God is not male nor female, but rather a Spirit. He has the qualities of both genders. For example, He has the protective qualities that are equivalent to a male, while He also has a caring attitude that is associated with a female. That is the reason that He created both genders: so He could give both equal qualities related to His own character! Jesus was male, He was not feminine in any way. In order to come down to earth, He needed a gender, because noone on earth is without gender. These are the qualities of a human being. Heaven is different, people are not classified by genders. This is a difficult concept to explain, I hope you understand! For further explanation, feel free to contact me! God bless!

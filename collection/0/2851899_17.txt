because it would mean that there would have to be thousands of agents, trucks and where do you think the money to pay them would come from? your pockets maybe. and if you're worried about illegals taking away your resources, wait till you have to pay more for everyting.. and i don't think that all those people were illegal. i know for sure that some of the people i know who went were born here so that's not a fair comment from anyone.

A hard to describe psychology of demons.. Its like this devious behaviour that seems relative of childhood. I have seen occult writtings of sex magic that seems to embrace and describe lustful demonology to the T. Like the demon of lilith.. . A devilish play outside of the light in the afterlife.. . I have read a near death experience which spoke of demons are ones who don't go into the light as to have much guilt as when you enter the light (god)  you are opening yourself fully and if you don't reach or goto the light you are in this area exposed to others including demons that can't due to self to enter the light.. . Makes you wonder about spirits that show them self and make them self known on earth. It seems it is true about not enter the light after death and a need for tieing lose ends while on earth.

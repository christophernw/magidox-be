The whale was named after the milky-white substance spermaceti found in its head originally mistaken for sperm..  . The unusual shape of the Sperm Whale's head is due to a massive cushion-like growth on the front of the head known as the spermaceti organ. It contains a clear, oily liquid called "spermaceti." In early times spermaceti was believed to be the sperm whale's semen. Today, this liquid is called "spermaceti" or "whale sperm. The species common name comes from this. Incidentally, we do not know, to this day, what significance spermaceti has for the whale!

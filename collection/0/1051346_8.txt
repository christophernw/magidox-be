Because they're idiots. They think just because a car notices them, it will stop. Sometimes there isn't enough time to stop. Sometimes the driver thinks they can beat you.. I do not drive, and I always make sure I check before stepping into the street. I don't care if I look like an old lady, some people are just crazy drivers.

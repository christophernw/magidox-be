Yes, exactly that kind of stuff is not made up unless his/her identity has been stolen.  You may want to have him/her have his credit ran to make sure there is nothing on there that is not his/hers.  BUT more than likely this person is lying to you and had a past and doesnt want you to know about it.  Also this person needs to go to the nearest police station and ask to see police records you need to go with him/her so you can see for yourself whatever they find on him/her. If a person has been in jail there would be police records.

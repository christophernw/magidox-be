Necrotizing fasciitis or fasciitis necroticans, is a rare infection of the deeper layers of skin and subcutaneous tissues (fascia). Many types of bacteria can cause necrotizing fasciitis (eg. Group A streptococcus, Vibrio vulnificus, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis), of which Group A streptococcus is the most common cause.. The infection occasionally starts with pharyngitis (sore throat), but more often begins locally, at a site of trauma, which may be severe (such as the result of surgery), minor, or even non-apparent. The affected skin is very painful, red, hot and swollen. Skin color may progress to violet and blisters may form, with subsequent necrosis (death) of subcutaneous tissues. Patients with necrotizing fasciitis typically have a fever and appear very ill. More severe cases progress within hours, and the death rate is high.. . The diagnosis is confirmed by either blood cultures or aspiration of pus from tissue. Early medical treatment is critical. Treatment often includes intravenous penicillin, vancomycin and clindamycin. If necrotizing fasciitis is suspected, surgical exploration is always necessary, often resulting in aggressive debridement (removal of infected tissue). Amputation of the affected organ(s) may be necessary.. . This disease is one of the fastest-spreading infections known as it spreads easily across the fascial plane within the subcutaneous tissue. For this reason, it is popularly called the flesh-eating disease and although rare, it became well-known to the public in the 1990s. Even under world best-care practices today, the prognosis has a mortality rate of around 20 percent. Mortality is nearly 100 percent if not properly treated. Correct diagnosis and early treatment of this disease is therefore of extreme importance.

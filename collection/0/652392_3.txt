Typically when a car only heats up at an idle or in traffic, that's usually caused by the electric cooling fan not working. The water could be lost when it heats up in traffic. If a headgasket is suspected, take off the radiator cap when the engine is cool and start the car and watch for bubbles. Typically if a head gasket is blown you have lots of white smoke from the exhaust also.

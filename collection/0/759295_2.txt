Whenever I am at the gym i motivated myself by bringing my cd player to listen to my favorites while excercising. I also look at magazines with celebrities like Beyonce and anyone else with great bodies. Also since it is closer to summer time then i know that i want to look good when i go shopping for halter tops and who wants to be heavier in the summer?

My suggestion is granny given and proven, it's close to the one of alternatives, but. . Press inward with pointer finger behind ears between bones,and press inwaed on that little thingy at the front of your ears with your middle finger at the same time and have someone else hold your glass of water while taking a breath then sip, then slowly release breath repeat for 5-10 sips ...and then again maybe we know the same bartender?? Grannies name was Julia...LOL

I also to tend to have this problem. I first adopted a male kitty named Nemo who is my baby. About 6 months later we adopted a female named Macy. Although I love her dearly, I tend to give Nemo all the attention because he's my little buddy and he's very much obsessed with me. The best advice I can give you is just to continue giving each of them individual attention. As long as they get along well, I wouldn't worry too much about it. Good luck!

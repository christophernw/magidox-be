As the last person said, you have to quit for yourself. Another person above said to figure out your priorities. I have not drank for 30 years and it became very easy very quickly. And I did it by myself. If you want to survive, you have to "just do it". But do it for yourself. You just quit, promise yourself to never do it again no matter what anyone says or does. This is for you. Do not be concerned what anyone else thinks. Do not be concerned about what anyone else does. Do this most important step for you. Good luck to you my friend.

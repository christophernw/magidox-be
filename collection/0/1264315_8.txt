To kill the fleas on her mix a solution of part water to part dish soap (palmolive, joy, or dawn).  Put the soap on her DRY coat. Do not wet her down first.  This will kill the fleas on her, but offers you no prevention. It will also clean the eggs off her coat. Let it sit for a few minutes and rinse it off.  Contrary to what some think this is not going to be bad for her and is better that putting a harsh flea dip chemical on her skin. If you feel uncomfortable using dishsoap, try a solution of water mixed with her shampoo or just straight shampoo. you will know it worked after you rinsed dead fleas off. Make sure to use a sink or shower sprayer to get them off amd rinse her well. Dishsoap even mixed with water can be hard to rinse.. . For your house, you can sprinkle borax, or epsom salt on your carpet at night, then vacuum up the next morning. Be sure to get under your bed and furniture. Wash your cats bedding andanywhere she lays around put the borax and salt. It kills flea eggs.  At night, you can also set out a small pan of water with a couple drops of soap and put a light over it. The heat attracts the fleas and they will jump into the light and fall in the water and drown.  . . This may take a few rounds depending on how bad your flea problem is.  You can also buy diatomaceous earth online or at a feed store to put outside and it is safe to put in your house too. It is a fossil that dehydrates the fleas. This will get rid of the adult fleas.  If you put it in the house, vacuum it up after a day or so and put more down. Also, put some in your vacuum bag to kill whatever you vacuum up (same if you use salt or borax). . . I don't like chemicals, so I try to use them as a last resort. If none of this works, time to go to the vet or go buy some frontline, but you must get them out of the house too.. . Hope this helps.

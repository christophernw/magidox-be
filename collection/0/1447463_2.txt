Search renters rights on the web. It does list your rights as a renter by each state. Even if he doesn't belong to the association he still has laws he has to abide by. Also in your original lease does it mention anything about repairs, who's responsible, & who pays the cost along with a time frame for repairs when needed. I have leased before & all of the above was covered in my lease. I feel sorry for you. It is a problem especially if the landlord wants the money, but doesn't want to spend any on repairs. Hope this helps you good luck.

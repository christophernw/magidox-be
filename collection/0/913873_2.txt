Go to the correos - get the box, pack and ship and wait and wait and wait ..... . it took nearly 2 months to get our box. . . The most worrisome part was that the tracking feature on the correo site said "have no information on this item".. We thought it was gone forever and one day it showed up.. . We didn't choose the quickest option (expensive), maybe you should.

Well about two days ago someone emailed me from on here and said are u saved? Please see the link... so my dumb *SS clicked the link and it was some christian site and had like two buttons on the site that you click, one of the buttons says, press here if your not a believer and the other said, click here if u are.  I dont know I just find it kind of bizare that someone would email me and they dont even know what a gnostic is. And I had a catholic email me and said I need to get right with this religion and lets pray for the saints, because they can really help you. I dont know Im going to have to unable this email feature now.

Society has changed. Its more about gettin' where ya wanna go instead of taking the time to acknowledge someone with a simple hello. I do it all the time, mostly because in my job, its a requirement to say hello to EVERYONE. But it goes for when Im not working too since I see that my light mood can lighten someone elses'.

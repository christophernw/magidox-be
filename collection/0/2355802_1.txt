first of all,how can you sell your puppies online when you wont even know what kind of home their going to....it sounds like to me you are a backyard breeder. second,do you realize how much of a problem we have with overpopulation with dogs?The United States estimates that there are over 70,000 puppies and kittens born every twenty four hours.and its a fact that 25% of all animals found in a shelter are AKC or UKC purebreds.So if you are one of those people who contribute to that then you are as sorry as the people who mistreat the animals.if you were any kind of real breeder,you would screen potential owners very closely to make sure they were going to a safe enviroment and a loving home,how can you do that if you are selling animals online, and i doubt very seriously you are the person to take the dog back if they didnt want it.it sounds like your just trying to make a quick and easy buck. get off your lazy a** and get a real job like everyone else and stop making your dogs do the work for you

But the order of the defitions might help you. The defn for "understanding" comes last in apprehension, but first in comprehension. It might mean that "comprehend" is more frequently and more appropriately used to mean "understand" compared to "apprehend." And notice that all the definitions of comprehension are related to "understanding." In apprehension, there are other definitions of much different nature, such as "dread" and "arrest.". . And also note the origin of the words. Apprehend originated from apprehendere which means "to take hold of," whereas comprehend came from comprehendere meaning "to grasp fully." "To take hold of" is usually for physical things, while "grasp fully" is for intagible things, such as ideas (that are to be "understood").. . Hope you can comprehend this.

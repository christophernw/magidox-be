You do not need to be humble,this is a ploy by weak minded people to get motivated people to stop making them look bad.The world has changed so much especially in the US that a motivated person with talent is not liked for that reason alone set aside the fact that they mention it at all.People,mostly women will say you are a show off or are bragging weather you are or not so I believe you should be your best and forget the humble crap or the next thing they will want is for you to be submissive,that's already started.Most people have very little to offer I see it in there answers it all comes down to jealousy Excel RICK,Good Luck!!!!!!!!!!!

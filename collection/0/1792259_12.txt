Oh sweetie, so sorry. I never had this happen, so maybe my advice is no good, but first, at 6 weeks your baby is an embryo, not even a fetus. It has no way to survive outside the womb. My stepdaughter had the same dilemma, she chose abortion. I would've supported her had she chosen otherwise, but I think she did the right thing. I assume that, like my stepdaughter, the father is out of the picture.. . Another option is to give birth, which obviously means you will have to tell your parents (well, maybe not), and give your baby up for adoption. There are lots of couples who want to adopt.. . Anyway, good luck.

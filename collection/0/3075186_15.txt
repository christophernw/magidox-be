To answer that Nietzche, in of good and evil, studied the etymology or origin of the words.  He found that good and evil are concepts derived from noble societies, and good is like one self, and evil is like those on the same level with whom one doesn't agree.  So, good to me would be defined as me and my characteristics, and evil would be defined as a classmate that wears too much perfume, and her characteristics.  . But good and bad were described by slave cultures.  And bad was those people stronger than the slaves.  Good was what was not like the strong people.  So good was things like compassion, humility, and kindness, and evil was dominant, strong, proud, and cruel.. I personally distinguish them by how helpful they are in making progress.  Good is helping other people, being responsible, and working to understand, and creativity.  Evil is humiliating people, being irresponsible, repressing people and promoting ignorance.

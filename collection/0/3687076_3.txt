Usually one of three major career paths:. . 1) Teach.  This is about the only choice if you are a "historical biblical scholar" (taking a non-religious analytical view of the Bible).. . 2)  Write books, travel, and lecture.  This is often combined with teaching, but some best-selling Christian authors have a biblical scholar background, and do not teach at a University.  This requires a lot more showmanship and people skills.. . 3)  Preach.  Biblical scholars who belong to a particular denomination or religious school of thought are often the head pastor at a large church.. . These three are all interchangable - I suspect most Biblical scholars do at least two of the three.  None of them are particularly high-paying jobs considering the amount of education they take, but hey, if you're doing what you love, you'll enjoy it anyway . . .

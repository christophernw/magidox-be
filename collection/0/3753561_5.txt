Hi.. . Generally when you hear the term "majority leader" it is in reference to the leadership of the Senate.  In that case, the majority leader is the person chosen to lead the political party that is in the majority in the Senate.  The majority leader is chosen theoretically without regard to sex, gender, etc., but based upon party leadership and other political qualities (character, influence, etc.).. . (Insert sarcastic comment about politicians here.). . The fact that most elected officials are Caucasian, Protestant, males is simply a by-product of the US culture, which seems to prefer to elect people meeting this description into political positions.  (Of course, there isn't a lot of diversity in those who choose to run, either, so one could argue that the American public doesn't have a lot of diversity in choice.). . However, if the U.S. Senate and House were chosen based on racial and economic demographics (e.g. predominantly Hispanic districts had Hispanic representation in the same income level, etc.), then I expect you'd find that the makeup of the government would change considerably.. . Yet, I would still expect that the term "majority leader" would refer to the person's political affiliation (i.e. being part of the majority party) rather than their demographics.. . Hope this helps.

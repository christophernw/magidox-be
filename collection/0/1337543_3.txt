A full day of manual labor works for me.If I take it easy or work at a sitting like a desk job i`m not really physically tired when I go to bed.It`s natural for man to do manual labor,but in todays world people set all day to work.Even though they`re mentally tired at night,they`re not really PHYSICALLY tired,because their body has done nothing,but sit in a chair all day.

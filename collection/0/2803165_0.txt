The short answer is national prestige.  Germany was newly created and wanted to show itself to be as great as the other great powers like Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands etc.  Also, for economic reasons, the exploitation of new resources to fuel its industry.  Hope that helps or at least gives you something to begin to research futher!

take the oil dipstick out and run the engine thats the bad way.. or if it is like any other engine under the engine there is a plug unscrew and let the oil drop into a oil pan. after all the oil is out take the plug/screw and tighten it then take the oil filter out useing a tool from any auto parts store then screw it out get the new oil filter in then tighten it very well (mistake me and my dad did when we changed our RVs oil(oil goes every where)) in the engine on top there is a oil cap open it and put the amount of oil(use either internet or drivers manual best to use drivers manual(don't have it put the 3 quarts, then get the dip stick out and check where it is marked add by 1/2 quarts if needed))put the cap on and put the dip stick on check plug and check the oil filter.start the engine for 10 seconds and check the oil pressure on the dash board goes to the middle. if it isn't showing stop the engine and check under the car and see if there is oil under the car and check the plug oil filter and oil cap and the oil dip stick.

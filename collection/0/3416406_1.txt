The origin of the word "Dodo" is one of controversy. Some people believe it's related to the Dutch word "dodaars" (refering to the feathers on its buttocks) the name of the little Grebe or Dabchick in the Dutch language. Probably not entirely because they shared a similar physical appearance (apart from the feathers on the buttocks), but because the dodo, like the little Grebe, couldn't walk very well, making it an easy prey for Dutch sailors. Others believe it's related to the archaic Portuguese word "doudo" meaning fool or simpleton. Yet another possibility, as author David Quammen has noted in his book "Song of the Dodo", "that 'dodo' was an onomatopoeic approximation of the bird's own call, a two-note pigeony sound like 'doo-doo'."

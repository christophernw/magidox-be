a great marketing hit! if you do this right you get a profit return in less then 6 months! the Japanese are desperate! they pay hundreds of $s for some species of fish!. . you need a certain amount of money before even thinking of going into this business. the most important aspect is doing everything from the early start.. . if you email me, I can surmise from the size of your investment, how big a project you can launch, and which consultant you can hire. There are very few fitting consulting aquaculture companies in the US, and even for a small project you must import one to make it worthwhile.

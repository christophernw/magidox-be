I agree that "IT" is not harmful in any way.  However, people with addiction or compulsive behaviors may engage in said activity excessively, causing them to avoid other forms of social interaction.  Occasional overindulgence is fine and each person has to define an acceptable frequency and be aware if excessive self gratification prevents social interactions with members of the same or opposite sex (depending on your interests).

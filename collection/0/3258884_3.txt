That made me think. It's kind of true. We do have no power. The government just makes it seem like we have it. I live in the US, and 200 years ago the white rich men were in power, guess what, they are still in power. The government controls it all. We have no say, that is why there are eletroro (I suck at spelling) votes. We don't even choose the president, we choose the people who chooses the president.We have no power, only an image of it.

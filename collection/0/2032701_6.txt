If this person is truly an influential person in your life, then you could possibly benefit from their eccentricities. There could be a valid reason for their superior actions. Try to get to know them and find out. If they really don't possess these capabilities, but are in a position to cause you a problem...say with your job...then stay away as much as possible. Being hateful and ugly towards them will only come back to bite you. Avoidance usually works.....you can't change them.

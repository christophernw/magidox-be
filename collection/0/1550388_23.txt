Hitler's father was 1/2 jewish and then abandoned his mother (and him). He grew up very poor and his mother died, leaving him to get caught up in some bad circles where he landed on the wrong side of the political party in power. He went to prison and wrote his treatise on government (Mein Kampf). He blamed the jewish heritage of his father on his physical shortcomings and the abandonment of he and his mother by his "jewish" father which resulted in his criminal behavior and subsequent prison term. An upstart Nazi party chose him as their leader once he got out of prison based on his book. Once in power he systematically went about having all the people in the Nazi party that could oppose him killed. Once he was in power and elected as te Fuhrer by the political parties, he did the same thing until he was the absolute ruler and then he set out on his quest to conquer the world. Part of which was to eradicate what he thought were inferior races, the Jews being the lowest on that list. It all started with the abandonment by his father.

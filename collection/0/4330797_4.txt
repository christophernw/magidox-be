Hoesntly i don't liek the look of amber lights in teh rear, but the more i drive the more i like them.  An amber turn signal sticks out way better then a flashign red light, check it out next time you are driving, it shoudl register better, I think we just know to associate amber with rutning signals, and when we see red, it takes that extra second to figure out if they are stopping of turning.

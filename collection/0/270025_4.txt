Sounds like everyone thinks your are speaking of illicit drugs or abusing drugs.  I'll take the tact that you are asking about medically prescribed pharmaceuticals.. . All drugs have side effects and can pose a threat to your health.  That is why your doctor is trained in determining the benefits to risks of your medical condition to the medication(s) prescribed.. . Also, if one drug doesn't work or causes you what are called untoward (bad) side effects, there are normally alternative medicines they can use.  Sorry, but that is why they call it the practice of medicine.

You talking about fast food, retail, restaraunts etc. They are hiring the ones who will work for the least amount of money. Maybe 1 out of ten of these immature people will make it, the rest will turn over.. I really dont think you're talking about proffessionals, big business or corporate America, those employees have at least made it through puberty.

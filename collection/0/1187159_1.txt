Because all they can see is the bad in the world and not the good. They would rather give up than try and improve things. . . This isn't just Christians, either-- a lot of people focus only on the negative.. . It's a lot easier to give up and stick it out and try to make the world a better place.. . I prefer to enjoy things as they are, and if the world ever "ends", at least I enjoyed the ride...

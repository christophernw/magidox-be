You have to be kidding.  Wasn't it Bush who said during the campaign he was not into nation building?  What is he trying to do now in Iraq?  As far as our civil liberties:  tapping our phones, warrantless entries/searches, recinded whistleblower protection for our Federal employees, trying to overturn Roe v Wade, talk about "activist judges".  Look whose on the Surpreme Court now.  I could go on and on....... . Sudan? Darfur?  You aren't serious.  He has done NOTHING!. Gotta go....my blood pressure is acting up!

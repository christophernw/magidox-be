See a Skin Specialist, you may be able to get "abrasion" - I don't recommend it though. Once this procedure is completed you will forever and ever never be able to sun bath. The skin on your face will be ultra-sensitive to ultra violet rays and you will sunburn very easily. You could see a Plastic Surgeon, but I don't know your age, and you may be too young for facial surgery. I have covered my pox marks up by wear "bangs" most of my life. I know they are bothering you, but love the skin your in, real beauty is within you sweetheart! Good Luck

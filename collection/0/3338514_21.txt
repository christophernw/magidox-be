It's the ones who go out of their way to give rude, hateful, violent and/or sick answers who bother me the most. . . Have a problem with a pet? You'll be told to kill it, abuse it, and so on.. . Ask about a movie? You'll hear how much others hate it, how stupid you are for liking it, or the wonderful 'I don't know' or 'who cares?' answers.

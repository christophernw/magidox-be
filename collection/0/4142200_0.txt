Globalism, an older term going back to atleast the 1950s, is usually used in regard to geopolitics to indicate an internationalist(vs. isolationist) viewpoint and interests in every corner of the world. Globalization usually refers to the spread of capitalist values and Western popular culture by economic means, especially Free Trade and investment in the Third and developing worlds. There seems to have been a Left-Right flipflop whether the turmoil and changes in "Traditional" societies is a bad thing and glacial socio-political "stability" a populist ideal.

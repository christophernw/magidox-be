God is no respector of persons. We are the ones that set these limits and standards. Who says the rich, the white, and the perfectly healthy are happier or better off? The world says it..not God. History is full of people that have overcome tremendous odds because they were born in various unfavorable situations to go on and lead extraordinary lives, often giving God the credit for their abilities to get past lifes stumbling blocks. You think wealth and beauty and perfect health aren't hinderences for some people? Alot of beautiful perfect people spending alot of their wealth trying to hang on to something that never mattered to begin with and they will be forgotten as they have forgotten themselves. Yet if you ever notice...every single person in the Bible..except for perhaps Soloman..was a person of lowly obscure origen with severe weaknesses. Moses, Abraham, Jacob, David, Ruth and Naiomi, Lot, Christ was born in a manger to poor parents and all of his disciples were commen men, Paul was a wretched persecutor of Christians..so...Its not where you start..but where you end and the journey in between...just remember..Acknowledge God in all your ways and He will direct your paths...better that than trying to navigate all on your own. Love in Christ, ~J~ <><

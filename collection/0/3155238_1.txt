Psychology.... and it works on 9/10ths of the people. It does not work on me, however. If the price of gas is $1.29 and 9/10s, I tell people it is $1.30. The psychological part is that stations(gas) use that fraction to induce people into thinking it is $1.29 and NOT INTO THAT HORRIBLE $.30 range.. Same for a shirt that sells for $5.99.It is actually $6.00 but it sounds better if it is UNDER $6 and when not so bright people see $5.99, they automatically categorize it as being in the $5 range and not the $6 range.

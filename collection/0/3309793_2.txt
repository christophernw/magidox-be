We are supposed to avoid these in Hinduism as well, although I eat them sometimes.  In Hinduism it is because these are rajasic I believe and cause one to not have a calm mind.  It makes meditation more difficult because of the way they agitate the mind.. . I know that when I eat onions before going to bed, I have some of the wildest freaky dreams ever!  I'll dream about bugs and gross things all over and stuff.  So it seems to me that it could be true what they say about onions and garlic, based on this experience of mine.. . I am assuming the Buddhist reasons would be similiar since they are also very big on meditation.

Ok, he's a retard from what u say. What I think u should do, is first to tell him to SHUT UP, and if tht doesnt work, u should play music even louder than his tht u know he doesnt like (wearing earplugs yourself) untill he gets sick of it. When he asks u why u did that say sumthing like,"I'll turn my music down if u turn our's." and if he agrees but cranks up the volume any way, u do the same. Soon he'll get the drift.

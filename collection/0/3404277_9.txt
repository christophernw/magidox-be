Pork is considered to be an unclean animal. Pork contains many dangerous bacteria and even tapeworms. Back when those religions were established there was no effective way to sanitize the meat thus it was forbidden. Judaism and Islam are two examples. As for the reasoning that pigs themselves are unclean, it is entirely incorrect. Pigs if left to themselves will all defecate in the same spot all the time. They only bathe in mud because they are unable to sweat and are very suseptible to sunburns. So the mud acts as a cooling agent and sunblock.

Secondly, nature differs from woman to woman...agreed that there are basic things that are common to all women when it comes to nature, but the way each woman would respond to a given situation would differ, likewise the way each woman would give a reply to your question would differ just as the way each woman would treat you if you live together under thesame roof will differ..

atoms cannot become solid, a substance can become solid. the electron cloud (area of electrons) takes up the majority of the space and yes, it is made up of mostly empty space. a substacne becomes solid when the intermolecular bonds between particles form (has nothing to do with empty space). this is achieved by lowering the temperature and slowing down the average kenetic energy of the particles

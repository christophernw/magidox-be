I'm so glad you asked this question. And thank you so much DJAix for answering! I have always wondered what happened to little Mary Gilbreth. My sisters and I are fans of the Cheaper By The Dozen book, the Gilbreth's are dear to our hearts. Thanks for providing us with the link to the Gilbreth site:)

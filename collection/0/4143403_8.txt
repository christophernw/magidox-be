Luckily it is grilling season and you can cook out, chicken on the grill is great, just season it the night before and have it with salad, rice or as a sandwich.... there are a million websites that have great, healthy recipes for health conscience people, It is definitely a lifestyle change but before you know it you'll wonder how you ever ate "that stuff" before. Good Luck!

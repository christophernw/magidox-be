There are many Islamic individuals and groups that see ' Western Culture' as a threat to Muslim thought and ideology.. Some of these individuals/groups have banded together to FORCE the withdrawal of Western influence in the middle-east region.  Unfortunately, they have 'hijacked' true Islam, and turned it into a hate/kill/destroy theology, using the frustration of years of LOCAL mis-management of resources to BLAME Westerners ( especially Americans ) for the plight of many citzens of that area.. . Recruits are easy to find, because the local governments have neglected the needs of its own citizens, finding it easy to blame westerners for the problems that THEY THEMSELVES have caused.  Add to this school of thought the religious rhetoric that promises PARADISE for those that martyr themselves for this ' False Islam ', and the result is the current INSANE state of affairs the world is experiencing.. . Americans have a TERRIBLE ineptness at propaganda.  Hence the ' False Prophets ' find it easy to spread lies and mis-conceptions about Western idealism, blaming us for ALL the world's problems, twisting the Quran and Hadith to meet their own POLITICAL ( NOT RELIGIOUS!! ) agenda.. . A sad state of affairs.

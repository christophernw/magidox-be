Some people are given everything and never have to develop traits of motivation and tenacity.  They don't know how to push themselves to do things that don't appeal to them and when they do begin something, if they get tired, they quit.  For some people in this instance, it really is not their fault.  The people who trained them to be this way are to blame.  ( This is only one instance, this does not apply to everyone that is lazy.)

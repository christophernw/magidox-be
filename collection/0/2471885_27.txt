Thanks for pointing out Joyce's info.  There IS still a difference.  Focusing just on the notion of "understanding," here's my take:. . APPREHENSION is the notion of understanding the gravity of a situation, including all implications and contingencies.  It connotes "utmost importance.". . COMPREHENSION is very literal - simply the act of understanding an event or a communication such that it can be conveyed accurately to another reader or listener not present to witness the original matter at hand.  It connotes "thoroughness and accuracy," which is the meaning of the related word "comprehensiveness.". . Your question is a good one - it illustrates why English is one of the world's toughest languages to master.

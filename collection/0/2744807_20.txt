Because we walk by faith and not by sight.  Doubt is a dangerous thing, and it gets the best of us sometimes. But just look around you, especially at this time of year, the total renewal of everything, a shaking off of the cold & bitter, another chance to start over.  It's a reminder of the resurrection story, a rising up from the grave for a glorious reunion with the Son (sun!).. I have to believe He is real.  Hope this helps.

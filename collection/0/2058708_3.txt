Bad luck. or bad genes.  . . Eczema is an autoimmune response, like allergies or asthma, that can flare up as your immune system decides to attack real or immaginary irritants.  Then, it is a self-perpetuating cycle of irritation, scratching, dryness and more irritation.  . . You can hope it will lessen over time, or at least shift to less viisble or painful areas, but otherwise, you just have to treat the irritation with steroid ointments, lotion or just vaseline.  I have also found that making my showers cooler and shorter has helped.

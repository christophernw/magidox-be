First off I have to say I am truly sorry... You just purchased one of the WORST scooters on the market. Second it's 25 to 1 while breaking it in and 30 to 1 when broken in using synthetic or just stick with the 25 to 1. If you have a 4 stroke however no mixing necessary( these have yellow colored engines ).

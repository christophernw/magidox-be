This is 100% GUARANTEED I have used it all my life and works everytime.  Fill a pint glass or a glass not too much smaller with water.  Put your fingers in your ears (sounds mad but bear with me....) and get someone to 'feed' you the water quite quickly and you must drink it down without stopping.  It's important that you don't stop half way through.  This will work!

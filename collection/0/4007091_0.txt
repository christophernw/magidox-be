The 68-72 GM A-body rears would be a direct swap as far as bolting it into the car. One of the things you would need to watch for is the U-joint size difference between Chevy and the other GM models. I do believe the aftermarket make conversion u-joints just for this problem. If you have a choice try to find a rear out of a Chevy as they have 8.875 inch ring gears as opposed to the 8.5 inch rear that Olds used in 68-69. The chevy rears are MUCH easier to find parts for and it seems like every rearend shop will work on the Chevy stuff.

I've been married for a little over 6 years and I've never cheated. I think some girls hook up with guys that the only thing they wanted was some sex in the first place. These guys know how to pick up the ladies, they say and do the right things to get you and after they have you they are looking for the next thing. Try picking some guy who isn't the smoothest, if some guy has a really hard time picking you up then it's not so likely that he'll just cheat on you. The shy guy, the guy who doesn't have that much experience it a better pick for a long term thing.

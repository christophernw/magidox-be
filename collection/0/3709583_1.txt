Find out what type of easement it is.  Whoever "owns" the easement, be it a municipality or a utility company, will be who you need to get it "back" from.  Some easements the municipality may want to keep for future expansion (of roads or utilities), and others you can vacate through the municipality division that deals with deeds.

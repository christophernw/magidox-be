Close.  I would say it's because the photons from the object hit a smaller area of the cornea.  If you think of the surface of the cornea as a screen onto which the world in front of the viewer is projected through a lens, as an object is moved away the angle between its top and bottom gets smaller and so the relative size of the object in that projection gets smaller.

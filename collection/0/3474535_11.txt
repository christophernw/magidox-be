I'm not sure about the laws where you are but in Australia that would have been a road rage (or carpark rage) incident so ask or look up the laws and read them as next time you can politely explain the laws to the person and explain if they don't stop abusing you then you will have no choice but to take a photo of them (as proof) and ring the police and have them charged with verbile abuse (or diahorrea). In Oz road rage is on the rise so fast that they now have shopping trolley rage, phone abuse rage etc.  What is this world coming to when a person who can't find a parking spot abuses a motorcyclist because they have parked in a spot!  Its ok I have had the same problems over here and I have politely told them to hold that aggressive pose so I can take a photo as proof before I ring the police.  I found they go away very quickly which then leaves me laughing and it makes my day seem better.  I live to explain my rights to people and to show them how they are breaking laws by infringing on my right to park in a parking spot!  If all else fails tell them you pay your road tax and other charges just like they do which gives you the right to park there.  Good luck.

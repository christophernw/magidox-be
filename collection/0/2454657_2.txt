I don't beleive it's always the mechanic that has the bad reputation, more along the line of the repair shop itself.. . Like in any other business, there are some good and some bad, some just parts changers as the other person stated.. . Most reputable technicians go thru serious training to become certified thru ASE or manufacturer training.. . To properly diagnose one of todays  vehicle's takes a huge amount of skill and learning processes. . . I've seen issues where even the very best technicians can't find a problem, the factory engineers are called in to help and even then, they themesleves may not know how to repair. . . The complexity of cars and trucks today is by far greater than years past, even some require a pc to be connected to the manufactuer data base before they can even start to diagnose some types of problems.. . Most technicians I've been associated with are honest hard working people. . . Sure there are a few bad apples, and to those that aren't, I give them a tremendous amount of repsect for having such dedication to not just their profession, but to their customers as well.. . Just my 2 pennies worth--great question . . Jerry Christopher. http://www.usedcarwise.com

This is very contraversial because some say that it is a choice and others you are born this way. But the way I see it is that you have to decide what your limits are. Here's a hypothetical. Is a person gay even if they don't have sexual interactions with the same sex? What if they want to experiment but don't like that they want too? Because you think about it, does that mean you are? Well, I think not. We are all curious beings!. So what you have to do is decide what you want to do. Experiment! But don't do anything your uncomfortable with.. The hardest thing about testing this is that no one open to being bi will kiss and say if they like it or not. I think we could all be if we wanted too. How many heterosexuals have ever had both and chose what they want? not many. So then how can they say they are not? How do they know they are not repressing their feelings?

"Intermodal transportation" simply means the use of two (or more) different modes of transportation (such as rail and roadway) to move goods OR people.. . For example, to get to Hawaii you may use 2 modes to make the trip. First you start out by driving to an airport, from the airport you then take a plane to get to Hawaii. So you used a car (that's 1 mode) to get to the plane (the 2nd mode) which you then flew on to get to your destination. . . The use of 2 interconnected modes of transportation to make that single trip would be considered a form of intermodal transportation.

Alcohol was banned in the US during prohibition, but it was a terrible failure.  The bible doesn't forbid alcohol, it states that you shouldn't get drunk and abuse it.  While the US government is based on religious beliefs, it also believes in allowing people personal freedom.  Most places in the States have banned smoking in close quarters (ie restaurants) and public drunkeness.

Well thats a think which bothers many women after pregnancy..        U can definately strat exersixing after consulting with yr doc who discharged yr baby. I think after pregnancy a little belly fat is quite natural. So u got to do some other workouts and lift light weights so that yr problem is solved..         Dont take advice from anyone who dont knows abt yr medical history..         Iam a fitness trainer if u need any consultation u can contact me on tutul_chakraborti@yahoo.com

Peke's are a breed that still have a lot of the wild nature in them. My Husky/Shepard mix is the same way and does the same thing. Most vets cannot tell you for sure but some theories are thet they are testing the integrity of the surface, they are trying to make it more comfortable for themselves, or they are actually trying to clean the area before laying in it.. . Mine does it on the furniture too so I know it's not about trying to make it more comfy. I do believe that he is likely trying to clean the area and he is obsessed with grooming himself, will not eat, eliminate, or even vomit near his cage,( which I no longer use but he loves it so he still has it with the door off). He will even, when sick, get up and vomit on newspaper. He's just compulsively clean. And was a breeze to housebreak.

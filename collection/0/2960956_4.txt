You've got to do exercises that focus on your middle.  Like sit-ups and ab crunches everyday for at least 10 minutes.  Also while standing so some stretches that also focus on the middle.  Like twisting your waist and bending your body so your sides get a good stretch.  If you are consistent and work on it everyday then you will start seeing results in about 30 days.  But before working on the sit-ups and stuff...do about 20 minutes of dancing or something just to get your heart rate moving.

If Dems can get these things passed with a Rep president, we will increase taxes on the rich, allowing states to get the federal funding they should be getting so that they can lower or at least stop increasing state taxes.  State taxes tend to fall harder on the poor or average americans, do you really feel like your total tax burden is lower"?  I don't, I feel like I am paying more in taxes than ever before because of all the state taxes, fees etc. that have had to go up to offset the federal money not coming to the states to fund the tax cut for the riches Americans.  Dems are not weak on national security this is a Rep con job.  What they have given us is a negation of constitutional rights, excused as protecting us from terrorism.  I am not safer, just less free.  This is a joyous day for America.

"It was said it was the sign of a healthy pig if its tail curled. Sometimes we reached over and grabbed a curly tail to see if it would straighten out and then snap back like a coil spring. Instead, when we touched the tail, the pig would straighten it out and when we let go, it would curl up again. We would laugh and try it again. The pigs didn't mind. They apparently could straighten the tail at will and then it would go back to the natural curl."

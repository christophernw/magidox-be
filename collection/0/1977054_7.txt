Couscous (IPA /kʊskʊs/ - Berber Seksu - Arabic: كسكس‎ [1]) is a food of the Maghreb of Berber origin. It consists of grains made from semolina that are about 1 mm or 1/16th inch in diameter (after cooking).. . The dish is the primary staple food throughout the Maghreb; in much of Algeria, eastern Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya it is simply known as ta`aam طعام, "food". It is popular in the Maghreb, the West African Sahel, in France, in western Sicily's Trapani province, and parts of the Middle East. It is also very popular among Jews of North African descent.. . Couscous was traditionally made from the hard part of the hard wheat Triticum durum, the part of the grain that resisted the grinding of the relatively primitive millstone. The name is also used for prepared dishes made from other grains, such as barley, millet, sorghum, rice, or maize. Couscous is traditionally served under a meat or vegetable stew.. . In the United States couscous is known as a type of pasta, probably reflecting the influence of Sicilian immigrants. However in most other countries it is treated more like a grain in its own right. It is particularly valued for its rapid preparation time.. . In French-speaking countries in sub-Saharan Africa, fufu is often called cous-cous.

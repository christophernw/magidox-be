I don't know how common this is, but I am actually more inclined to trust a person if I know they are gay. I think this is because some of my best friends are gay, so I associate the two things.. . It's also possibly because of the lack of sexual tension between us. If I meet a straight girl, I will always subconsciously flirt with her, and with a straight guy, I will always compete. However, If the person is gay then there is no attraction or competition to worry about, and we can get on with being friends. I like this.

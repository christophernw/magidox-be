military participation was not an issue.. after all most of the people in the viet nam war were drafted and had no choice, and anyone that actually stayed and fought once they got there.. were all heroes..in my book.   i vote for the best candidate who has similar beliefs and goals that i have.. and are concerned about the same issues i am concerned about. bush wasn't in the war.. so maybe that is why we are in iraq..now./ may be if he had witnessed the death..injury and loss he would have had seconds thoughts.

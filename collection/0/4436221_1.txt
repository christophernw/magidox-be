First of all, Catholics and Baptists are both Christian, so your real question should be:. . What is the difference between a Catholic Church and a Baptist church?. . The answer is:  There are a lot of differences.. . Catholics have the Crusifix at the altar, the Tabernacle (where the consecrated host is kept), the Holy Water, candles at the altar, the altar is at the front of the Church (so Catholics enter the back of the building).. . We, Catholics, have icons of Saints, the Holy Virgin Mary, Stations of the Cross, confessionals, stained glass windows (o.k. Baptists may have those also, but I haven't seen them in the very few Baptist church buildings I have been in).. . wow, there are a lot.

I'm paraphrasing someone.... . We are on Earth for two reasons: to know and love God and to help others to know and love Him.. . As to why we undergo suffering, we fell with Adam and Eve for their sin.. . As to why we aren't "up there," we are tried here "refined like gold in the fire" so that we may choose Him rather than death.  In His Divine Presence, we would be unable to sin and would thereby lack free will - and what merit is there in doing something that we are compelled to do?. . Hope this answers your questions.

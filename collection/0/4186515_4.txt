WE should drink several litres of water a dayto keep our body healthy...eg 3L. .  There is such a thing as water intoxication where far too much water is taken on board, and this causes an inbalence in our electrolytes, and cause serious systemic problems, such as disrupting the amount of potassium we need to function normally.

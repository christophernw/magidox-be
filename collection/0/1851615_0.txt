A combination of Abstinence and Safe sex. We can't  simply rely on schools to teach our kids  about sex...my parents avoided the issue and just assumed I would learn from school...I actually found out what really went on from accidently turning on a porn that was left in my VCR...so I think i woulda rather had my parents talk to me about it.

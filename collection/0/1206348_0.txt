THere are sprays you can spray onto your chair that cats dont like the smell of but they must be reapplied frequently.. Use SOFT PAWS or other claw covers - these work brilliantly.. If you see this when its happening - spray the kitty wiht one squirt of water... this only will work if you catch the cat in the act of scratching and dont spray more than at that time.. (hitting wiht newspaper as one person suggested will not work and cats can avoid this anyhow). Make the spot less accessable - provide kitty with a scratching post and more toys (honeysuckle toys)

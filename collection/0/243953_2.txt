The red and green x above a lane on the expressway generally mean that that lane is down to traffic.  They are usually in larger cities where during rush hour more lanes are opened to get people in or out of the city faster... they signal that the "express" lanes are closed to traffic in your direction. Or the same with the toll Plaza's.

All  things  shall  come  to  you  in  time.....when  you  pray  to  God  things  not  going  to  happen  right  away....you  got  to  be  patient.....just  like  he's  been  calling   for  you  to  repent  your  sin....it's  goes  both  ways  too.....i  bet  if  you  read  your  bible,  go  to  church  and  ask  god  to  forgive  you  for  your  sin  you  might  get  answers  there....and  don't  just  do  it   because  you  just  looking  for answers.....just  belived  in  him  and  all  things  shall   be   imposable.. Best  wishes  and  good  luck

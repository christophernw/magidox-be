I don't have one, but I've seen several.  As far as it goes, you're lucky your engine isn't leaking yet, or that you haven't had head trouble.  These aren't good cars for that.  But if you hate it, just remember, it still zigs, and if you still hate it, just drive around a few bars late at night 'til someone has their insurance company buy you a new one.

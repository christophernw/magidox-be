No you can't. Many things are protected by privacy laws, just like they can't look up your driving record ans see where you live and when you were born, and your address!!. . You can look up some things, like in Illi you can see if a person is in prison, but not his record.. . Most states have Sexual offenders registration. Won't give you their record!

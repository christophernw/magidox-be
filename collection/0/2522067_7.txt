I think that the liberal left has a legitimate phyco impediment.  Their own lives are routine and boring, so they feel that they have to jump to create better lives for the miss fortunate of this, and other countries...  I also think  liberals are deeply upset at the loss of power they received at the last presidential  election.  This made them hate G.W. Bush, and they will attempt anything to topple this administration on the hopes of retrieving power.  they also suffer from "Guilty success"  feeling bad for being succsessfull.

Your body needs electrolytes to produce the electricity to keep your heart beating, among other things.  These electrolytes are really ions.  Drinking water generally  contains some of these; the others you get from your other foods.  Distilled water does not contain these ions because of the distillation process.  The most common use of distilled water is to top-up the wet-cell battery in our cars.  . . You can drink distilled water in an energency and it will do you no harm but you wouldn't get any electrolyte from it.  You cannot put drinking water in the car battery: the electrolytes will destroy its opertaion.  . . If you are scientific, I suppose the above answer gives rise to another question: If the electrolytes in drinking water produce electricity to operate my heart, why can't it be used in a battery to produce electricity, since a battery IS used to produce electricity?  But that's another matter!!!

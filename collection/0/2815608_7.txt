Actually Jews never touched the graves of the ancient Egyptian kings, they were built by Egyptians who re-located to the build site and sometimes it took so long to build them that entire generations would be born, work, retire and die on the site. Jews were not permited to work at the pyramids because it was considred holy and only Egyptians were allowed to help.

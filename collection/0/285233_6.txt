You won't be able to stop your cat from drinknig the fish bowl water until you put a lid on it.  You are crazy, not having a lid on it already!!  My cat would have had a few sushi dinners by now!. . You could also put it somewhere high where the kitty won't be able to get to it... but for the safety of your fish and their all-around well being, please, lid it.. . Good luck take care.

Have you looked in the mirror for "snobs" lately?  And who are you talking to?. . There is nothing wrong with living in a trailer, until a tornado comes.... then I'd think twice about it.. . There is a stereotype of "white trash" living in trailers, but it is outdated since there are so many nice trailers and trailer parks nowadays.. . I don't know who stuck a burr under your saddle, but you oughta stop bucking and start living your life, instead of trying to defend it.. . My daughter lives in a lovely trailer in Canada.  It's a lot nicer than my house!  LOL. . Best Wishes,. . Sue

Well, it's not to the level of giving birth, but there are a variety of male "pains." There's male-patterned baldness, prostate enlargement in old age (along with prostate cancer), a higher risk of kidney stones (which I have heard as the male equivalent of giving birth in terms of pain). Males are also more prone to mental and genetic disorders...fun for all. None of these though, would really match giving birth, that's one of the many reasons to respect women.

Heavenly Father-- Everyone needs someone to love and share their sorrows with and to give them strength and courage to live life.  In my childhood I found you when I was in need... and now in my adult life, I find myself in the depths of sorrow, alone and again dependent upon YOUR unconditinal love and care.  I need never feel alone, as I dare daily life.  I confirm:  "Nothing without YOU ... Nothing without ME."  In You, Father, I have eternal security in times of uncertainity.  With you Father, I am not afraid.  Amen

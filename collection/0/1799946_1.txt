Hi, The sea floor spreading is monitored by the megnetic strips on the sea floor. You may know this: the magnetic pole reverseses suddenly after sometime later~app. 10,000 to 15,000 years later. When the magma comes out through the spreading centers or divergent plate bounderies (at the sea floor), a layer of magnetic stripes forms.  The rocks, which have magnetic componets, from the magma, orient in the direction of the magnetic pole.  So, when there is a revarsal in magetic pole of the earth, Northpole being south and Southpole being North, the new strips from the magma will be in the other direction.  With this information, you can calculate the spreading rate.  I hope this helps.

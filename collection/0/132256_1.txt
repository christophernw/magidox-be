I think some people who do not have much sense of self-worth and don't really have a defined identity try to give themselves that definition by attaching themselves to their country, for better or worse, as a patriot.. . They suddenly have pride, values, and an identity!  Or at least they imagine they do.  But if someone comes along with an alternative viewpoint, for these people, what it really does is threaten their very way of life, the very things they now identify with, the things that keep them feeling safe and important, connected to the human race.  Patriotism is the last port in a storm for many sad people.. . Your debates, to the disenfranchised who cling to patriotism with desperation, become horrible slanderous remarks that threaten their way of life.. . Some patriots do not fit that bill, of course.  You can certainly be a patriot and be a reasonable, intelligent, and calm human being.  But those aren't the people I'm referring to.  ;)

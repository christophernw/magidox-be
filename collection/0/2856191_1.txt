It's great you have this belief. I guess you have never been the poor woman with an unwanted pregnancy. It is easy to stand up for something when it doesn't effect you directly. Perhaps we should go back to the catholic church belief and ban all contraception as well? The funny thing is women have fought for generations to obtain rights and now some smart men have figured a way to put them right back in the kitchen barefoot and pregnant. The sad thing is a lot of women are too naive to see this. Personally I don't believe in 2nd or 3rd trimester abortions except to save a mother's life. But in the first trimester there is little that can be called genuinely alive. I know I'll open a can of worms with that remark.  The idea is whose life is more important? The unborn fetus or the woman who has to bear it. You can say the fetus but in doing so you are pushing women back to the 19th century. I am betting that you are one of the religious right who can not be argued with logic or reason. Such as those screaming at women who are making gut wrenching decisions or firebombing abortion clinics and calling them baby murderers. Hopefully you will never become pregnant with a child that you are not ready for. As far as adoption goes look up the actual numbers. More women have suffered from depression and suicide giving up a child than by having an abortion. Oh, also because this is America.

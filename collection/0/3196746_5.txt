I had a white Phillips coffee maker too and had the same problem.  I constantly scrubbed after use with baking soda, vinegar (once both at one time....dont do that LOL!!!!)  I dont think it is possible to get it clean once its that far gone.  I bought a new one (different make) with the same results but not quite as bad.  The only staining is on the lid rather than everywhere.

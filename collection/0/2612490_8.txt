No offense to anyone, but there's quite a few wrong answers up there. . . The volume does not increase during commercials.  First off, all will agree that the audio in a commercial is generally very loud. 2ndly, when a show "fades to black" to go to commercial, both the video and the audio portion are faded down to zero.  So, when the commercial comes on, it sounds like it's much louder than the show you were watching. What you are hearing is the loudness difference between the quiet part of the show fading to black, and the commercial coming on "balls to the wall".  Additionally, when the show has a very loud scene going on, like a chase scene, it's no quieter than the commercials. The commercials just "seem" louder because of the way human ears work. This can easily be proven using test equipment to measure the peak audio signal during both events.

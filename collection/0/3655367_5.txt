It's just a little irritated.  If you can stand it, it will go away, but...when that happens to mine, it really bugs me and I don't have the patience to wait it out, so I take a fingernail clippers and clip the little bugger off.  Painful for a moment, but not as bad as putting up with the taste bud.  It heals over within a day.

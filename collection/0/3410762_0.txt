Well it is the year 2006 and today is the first day of summer.  Groups of the human race continue to suffer in unprecedented numbers on this very day .....of war, starvation in Africa and elsewhere and of other atrocities in this world.  You seem to want claim to that fame-don't. The human race has a flaw in their moral mentality not to be able to control themselves alot better than this by the year 2006.

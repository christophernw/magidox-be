Why do Athiests make fun of Bible stories? . . . because the stories are silly. . because most are handed down from older, earlier cult myths and paganism.. . because they are illogical, self-contradicting and erroneous.. . . they laugh in many ways the same way I'm laughing at your inane view of a complex scientific algorithm, one that you clearly have no grasp of whatsoever...

When the moon orbits around the Earth, in front of the sun...this is an eclipse. However, why it exactly covers the sun is only dependent of the perception of the viewer. Let's say that someone at the equator is looking at an eclipse and the viewer perceives a total eclipse. If someone can view that same eclipse in say, Alaska, they will not perceive it the same way, because they are not standing directly under the moon between the sun. To illustrate this point, make two fists, and put one in front of the other; in front of your face...you'll only see the fist closets to your face (the moon). We see the corona of the sun because it is so much larger that the moon (your back fist). Now keep your hands where they are and move your head a little to the right or left. You'll now have a different perception of the moon in front of the sun, this is called a partial eclipse.

Your entire post is not factual or comprehensible.  You never give a source, or explain what the pledge is, or clarify "ban".  The pledge of allegiance is not banned in the state of California.  You are talking about some story dealing with a school banning using it before meetings.  And most liberals don't give a crap about that.. . But I'm sure your bad question and post will draw some nice hate speech directed toward liberals, which is what you were really trying to achieve, right?

You already have seen an example of how annoying the people might be just because they find something different in other people.. . Your case: you made a mistake, you misspelled racist, and instead of use their intelligence to move on and answer something smart that can solve your question what do they do? well you already see.. . The same happen to people, if they look different or act different, or do the stuff people are used to in a different way, the other people get frightened and try to make fun of it, sometimes to annoy sometimes to cover their fears, but they don't care about how you feel, they are selfish and only look for their personal feelings.. . And sadly, this happen often in people from the US, I don't know if they feel like they don't make mistakes or so, but that the way it is, and is nearly impossible to change the mind of half a country.

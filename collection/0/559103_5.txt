It is supposed to be a hidden society high in the hills of Tibet where they have these "silver people" who can jump over mountains amd run at the speed of like. Sherpa have seen them and they come help you when you need it. Their town is in the shape of a lotus flower and they are supposed to have supreme intelligence. If you are lucky to find it you will never return becuase you dont want to:)

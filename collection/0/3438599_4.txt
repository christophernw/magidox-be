There is no way that nothing can cause everything.. . Even if you look at a simple watch you know it had a creator. . . 1. Every effect must have a cause.. 2. That effect is dependent upon its cause for its very     existence.. . 3. That which doesn't exist cannot be a cause, so nothing cannot produce anything. Think about it.

There are a myriad of uses for lasers...but the really interesting thing is that the vast majority of the uses of a laser were thought of AFTER it had been invented. In this case, necessity WASN'T the mother of invention. They had a laser and had to figure out what to do with it! My favourite use of lasers is probably holographics because the science of them seems to be so out of odds with the final results.

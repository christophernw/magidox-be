We haven't been around this bush.. How do you believe in what exactly?. . To Believe about God, the Bible, following God.... . Well read the Bible, ask God to speak to you as you do it.. Ask God, if He exists... and to show you in a way that is meaningful to you.. . Talk to people who do believe, because hearing others testimonies of God's goodness in their life is always very helpful, and helps build belief/ faith.. . Ask God to soften your heart, ask Him to open your ears to hear Him. . . I pray that God will answer you as you seek Him.

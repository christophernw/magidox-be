Yeah I hear that, it's because at first you didn't have a tolerance to them, then as time went by you began to obtain a tolerance. Then as time progresses you find that your high sucks, you have to wait all the time on some other dip chit to get them, that the people that do them suck, and it just gets old and mainly because of the tolerance thing you get irritated at all the other downfall easily because the crap doesn't blow you out of your mind anymore. I used to smoke all the time. I got sick of the people THE WAITING, the bullchit, and the backstabbing, so I quit!

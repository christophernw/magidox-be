I don't know but in Wiccan beliefs say cats are good luck. They seem to think that the cat is one with Satan and if you are a friend to a cat or good to cats then the devil will leave you alone. Black cats are said to bring blessings on any house that takes care of them. It is also said that cats carry the souls of the dead to the after world. As for me I don't believe in superstitions though anyways. If it weren't for bad luck I'd have no luck at all!

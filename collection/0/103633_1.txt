The gravitational attraction at the surface of a body is proportional to its mass and inversely proportional to the square of its radius.  Thus, bodies having the same density will have surface gravities proportional to the radius (since mass at constant density is proportional to radius cubed).  The moon's radius is about a quarter of the earth's, and it is less dense to boot, so the moon's surface gravity is about a sixth that of the earth.

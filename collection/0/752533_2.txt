We live in a circular universe on a circular world which spins in a circular fashion and goes around the sun in a circular orbit.. Everything was analog.. A sundial's shadow is analog.. The movement of a compass needle is analog.. Digital was developed with the advent of digital electric technology but it's roots were already being exhibited in the likes of simple computers called ABACUS.... You should check out the history of the Abacus.. quite interesting.

There is a lot involved with surrendering your parental rights.  You can do so to your spouse in the event of a divorce, however this would not exempt anyone from child support it just means that you can't have custody or make parental decisions for the child.  I hope you reconsider, however you will need an attorney if you decide to move forward with this act.

jeja vu is a term used for someone who  suddenly feels as if they have been there before.Example: you go into a antique store ok? all of a sudden you feel like you have been there before even if you haven,t,it feels familiar to you,its almost like you were there in another century....Its like familar to you like you have been there,seen it,know about it before....thats why a lot of people believe in reincarnation,they feel as though they were once there in another lifetime..........Weird huh? I have felt that familair feeling myself,but don,t know why...The term canalso be used when you have had  an experience in life,either good or bad,and you see someone going through what you have already been througha nd it brings it all back up to you,its like you are having a deja vu experience....As far Where the word came from im not sure,its probably just a term uses by phycologists..Hope this helps

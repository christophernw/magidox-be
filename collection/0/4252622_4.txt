along with the more glamourous investigations of "mythical" animals, the more mundane (and entirely valid) aspects of cryptozoology include:. . Animals thought to be extinct but that have survived (happens more often than you'd think).. . New species whose existence is not yet supported or accepted by science (at one time this would have included such animals as gorillas and orangutans) . . Animals that are found inexplicably living outside their natural habitat (ie piranhas in a Calgary lake, wallabies in Southern England, etc.)

Slavery was one of the main conflicts between north n south, south wanted slavery because their economy relied on farming while the north was more advanced with an industrial economy, southerners supported states rights while the north was more for a strong central government.  Major compromises that split the north and south was the annexation of texas and florida to the union. this gave the south more power than the north in the senate. some courts supported slaves and their freedom, that anger the south because they did not want to recognize slaves as humans but property.

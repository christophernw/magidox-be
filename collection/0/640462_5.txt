In what way do you mean give up?  The European Union is an economic organisation and does not plan to make utopia as it would be foolish since humans do not have the capacity and  capatilism, socialism,securalism or religism are the answers.  There maybe truth in combining these, but they are so diverse we are far from seeing it.. . Europe did not start the last world war alone, Japan can hardly be blameless.  Also at the time of the first world war, and to a lesser extent the second world war, much of the world was under European dominion so it would have been hardly suprising that a war of the old super powers would spill over to the rest of the planet.. . The EU may have some backers as a Super Power, but most of us do not wish to emulate a flawed idea of super power as the US is or the USSR was.  . . The US and USSR were culturally homogenous either natural in the case of the US or forcefully in the case of the USSR.  The EU is about diversity, one of its mottos is "Strength in Diversity". . The EU is not trying to create paradise it is trying to make life as good as possible for the citizens of the member states.  Utopia will never happen as long as people like myself and you cling to national pride.  . . Future generations may find the way but ours will never see it, all we can do is give them as many examples of society for them to draw from, be it that of the US, the EU, China, India, Iran or Bolivia.

"Prost" is quite common. It is a derivative of the latin "Prosit" - meaning "May it do well". "Auf X" is also used when one is drinking shots. It has no particular meaning except being a signal that everyone should empty their glasses. Then there is "Zum Wohl", literally translating to "To health/Comfort". "Auf Dich" denotes a toast "To you", and can additionally be used to propose toasts to other persons/objects as in "Auf Deutschland" (To Germany), "Auf die Liebe" (To love) etc etc.. . Other than that, some Germans use the French saying "Sant√®". In any regard, whichever you choose to use out of these, you will have a positive response.

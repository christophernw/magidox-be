Either are they merely cheating you,  someone stole your id and opened an account,  someone that knows you used your id to open an account, or this company bought out another company that you do owe.. . YOu need to get a listing of who had this account, where the address of the account is.  If it is ID theft, you will need to file a police report,  then you send a copy of the police report and a request for the money to be repaid.. . If they still don't, you file a law suit in small claims court.. . To get money from your account, they will have to had your account and routing numbers.  So someone had to give them this info.. . Or they sued you in court and got a judgement,

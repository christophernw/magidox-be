To start a fire you require 3 things ... HEAT >>> FUEL >>> OXYGEN ... imagine that these are in the form of a triangle and if you remove any one of them, there is no fire ... so no FUEL (eg wood) but you do have HEAT and OXYGEN then you have no fire ... water eliminates the HEAT element of the equation ...

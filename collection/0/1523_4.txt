Well since this question is under Economics, equilibrium is the point at which both the supplier and consumer will agree to purchase and provide a product. There is usually a graph that will show you where supply and demand meet. This point is called the equilibrium point. Over time the equilibrium price changes depending on how much a consumer is willing to pay for a product, how much it costs a supplier to produce a product, what technological advances have occured, the state of employment in a given economy, and how much a company has invested into capital.

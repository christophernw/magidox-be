if the mp3 player has a program than you just gotta find it and a lot of times the CD comes with it. Sometimes there is no program and you can just plug it into your computer and then the mp3 player will show up on the computer (a lot of times as "removable disk" F or whatever letter it gets) then you can open the disk by double-clicking it and you can drag the music files onto the folder.When your done adding the files you can eject the mp3 by using the "safely remove hardware" icon on the right-bottom corner(if your using windows) or right click it and select eject (on Mac).. . Hope it helps

The benefits are that you get an overall picture of what the student is capable of doing, not an arbitrary one. I can't think of any real disadvantages, except that maybe your gradebook isn't as packed with percentages and some parents might find that easier to understand. Also, portfolios take more planning, more organization, and in some cases more time to deal with.

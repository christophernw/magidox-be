there is only one way to avoid hell through salvation.. You must believe in God and His son Jesus Christ.. You must believe that Jesus was born lived a perfect life and died on the cross as the ultimate sacrifice for your sins..and then you must pray the sinners prayer you must admit that you have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and you must ask for forgivness for your sins and ask Jesus to come into your heart and accept Jesus as your Lord and your personal Savior..

J.P. Moorland has some great books about this, but I can't think of what they are called. But the Bible was definentally not eastern mythical books put together by Jews and Christians. There is NO historical evidence to back that claim up. It also did not just fall from heaven.. . Edit: The DaVinci Code is not a very good direction to go to get historical evidence about the Bible. It is ficition, as you can see from the first page when he says that the secret society is real. It's not real, why think the rest of the book is accurate?

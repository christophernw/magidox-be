Harry Potter is a wonderful series of books that broadens your imagination and lets you escape to a different world. .  I love the fact that so many people are reading books instead of watching tv. Books have so much more potential for imaginative ideas and activities..  Harry Potter, in particular, is a great example of good vs. evil, and how the good guy is sometimes temporarily defeated but eventually triumphs.

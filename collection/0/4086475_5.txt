As others pointed out the number one rule is the calories in must be less than the calories out.  That said, you can decrease your calories to the point that your body will go into a starvation mode, in which your body will conserve the calories it consumes.  . . If you feel you are eating healthy and obtaining a reasonable amount of exercise, there are some common medical conditions that make it difficult to lose or maintain weight.  You should see your doctor to be tested for these, the most common being a thyroid condition.. . If your physician clears you medically and you still continue to gain weight I would say the issue is with your diet.  Try joining one of the more common weight loss programs.  If you are not a fan of cooking or thinking about planning menus I would suggest something like Jenny Craig where you get preplanned meals.  If you like to cook or control what you eat more I would suggest Weight Watchers.  I have lost more than 40 pounds on it.  If neither of these is in your budget, check out TOPS which is a weight loss support group.  Having that support and fellowship of others really can make a difference in how successful you are.

i have written a few plays & what u should do is decide on a story. This includes a plot, characters, rising action, climax & falling action;just like writing a story in high school. From that point u decide what the setting is and look @ ur story & start creating dialogue. maybe u want narrator to set up the play. that's an easy and acceptable way to go. also in writing ur play be sure to include any set or blocking(stage movement of characters) that is essential to the flow of your play. Good luck in writing it. if u have any other questions, feel free to ask if reply is permitted in this question thing.

normally my cat peed in the bath tub when it couldnt find the litter tray so they don't make you upset by doing it on the carpet (so cute!! :D ) u could try telling them off just use an upset tone and they might see it is wrong to do it and then put them outside you don't have to lock them outside if they want to come in let them just make sure they see it is wrong to pee in the bath tub and right to pee outside ... hope it works good luck

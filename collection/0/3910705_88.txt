As mentioned before, skydivers require proper training ahead of time, and the pilot is instructed to fly the aircraft level and at a certain altitude, and there is a small window of opportunity where it is safe to jump. There is also a specific range of time within which one must open the parachute, which most passengers will forget during a time of panic.. . Commercial airlines do not have the money or time to stock planes with so many parachutes and train all passengers ahead of time in their proper usage, even if the conditions were ideal for using them. In an emergency, the conditions would not be ideal.. . Also, the military is properly trained, and like mentioned before as well, the planes are equipped with ejector seats, since it cost enough time and money to train those pilots in to perform their specialised tasks that they would not want to risk losing his life. Equipment can be rebuilt, however costly, but people cannot be as efficiently trained to make up for the loss. Sadly, according to the "good of the nation," the life of a specialist in the military is monetarily worth a lot more than the average civilian.. . Also, consider the security risk. Besides the accidental "user errors" of the passengers in the event of somebody opening the door mid-flight or simply not knowing how to open the 'chute, there's a possibility of terrorism that I don't believe has been mentioned yet.. . During ascension, when the plane is not yet too high up in the air, and there is smaller risk of being sucked into the engine, a terrorist could easily plant a bomb on the plane or kill a pilot and then bail out. I have a friend who is not afraid of heights but afraid of flying because he's an extreme control freak. He's bungee jumped and skydived before, and he wanted to bring his parachute on-board, but hte airline wouldn't let him because of this possible security risk.

It is a switch, nothing more, with either normally open contacts ( which means the contacts are not touching until the voltage is applied to the relay coil which closes the contacts to allow for a path completion ) or normally closed contacts ( which when voltage is applied to the coil part of the relay, it opens the contacts breaking the path. They come in all kinds of sizes from very small the size of pencil erasers to very large. This is due to the amps or load required for the circuit.

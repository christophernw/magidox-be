dry sockets normally happen 2 days after extractions onwards..but it is excruciating pain,that you could not possibly ignore with heading back to the dentist, so sometimes it can be just some food stuck in the hole, after 2 days you should be gently brushing the socket any way and warm salt rinse mouth wash,

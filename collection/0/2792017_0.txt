Seismic waves from earthquakes behave differently in different mediums.  Using data from seismometers (devices that measure earthquake energy) around the world, you can study the seismic waves generated from major earthquakes.  The types of waves, and their travel times tell geophysicists a lot of information about the interior of the earth.  The most recent development in this science is called Mantle Tomography - they can even resolve the presence of cold subducting plates!

Is it really taking up 'that much space'?. You cannot destroy what has been said 'in' the bible.. I suggest if you really must get rid of one, that you carefully wrap it so it isn't obviously a Bible, so people won't frown on you for the act, and discard it as you would any other book.. You cannot destroy God's word, deed, or works.. . Personally I can't throw them out either.

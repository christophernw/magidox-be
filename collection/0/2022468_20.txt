I think that most muslims do not know their own history and their own Qu'ran. if they did they would be shocked this is why scholars who study the history of the Qu'ran live in fear because they are finding out that most of the non hate full parts of the Qu'ran have come from christian sorces of his day. . . . They need Jesus.

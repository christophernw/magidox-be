I do so agree.I lived in Muslim countries for many years and adhered to their code of conduct.I feel the old adage 'when in Rome do as the Romans do' is as true today as it ever was.. We are a Christian country and welcome people from  all over the globe to live here and benefit from living here so please do not shove your beliefs in our faces as a way of saying thank you!. We respect your beliefs so why cannot you respect ours and leave your veils at home

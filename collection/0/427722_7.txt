You hold the bridge to your nose,look up and let the blood drip inward to your stomach, breath in through your nose (and not out)because the breath coming out is hotter making the wound expand and more difficult to control. As they say a towel is good (wet and fresh of course) and thats about it, remember it also depends on why your nose is bleeding as well. If you have difficulties reach me at (ivanislegend@yahoo.com)

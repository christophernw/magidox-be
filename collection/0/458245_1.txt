1808 Sir Humphry Davy (Britain) established the existence of aluminium and named it.. . 1821 P. Berthier (France) discovers a hard, reddish, clay-like material containing 52 per cent aluminium oxide near the village of Les Baux in southern France. He called it bauxite, the most common ore of aluminium.. . 1825 Hans Christian Oersted (Denmark) produces minute quantities of aluminium metal by using dilute potassium amalgam to react with anhydrous aluminium chloride, and distilling the resulting mercury away to leave a residue of slightly impure aluminium.. . 1827 Friedrich Wöhler (Germany) describes a process for producing aluminium as a powder by reacting potassium with anhydrous aluminium chloride.. . 1845 Wöhler establishes the specific gravity (density) of aluminium, and one of its unique properties - lightness.. . 1854 Henri Sainte-Claire Deville (France) improves Wöhler's method to create the first commercial process. The metal's price, initially higher than that of gold and platinum, drops by 90% over the following 10 years. The price is still high enough to inhibit its widespread adoption by industry.. . 1855 A bar of aluminium, the new precious metal, is exhibited at the Paris Exhibition.. . 1885 Hamilton Y. Cassner (USA) improves on Deville's process. Annual output 15 tonnes!.  . 1886 Two unknown young scientists, Paul Louis Toussaint Héroult (France) and Charles Martin Hall (USA), working separately and unaware of each other's work, simultaneously invent a new electrolytic process, the Hall-Héroult process, which is the basis for all aluminium production today. They discovered that if they dissolved aluminium oxide (alumina) in a bath of molten cryolite and passed a powerful electric current through it, then molten aluminium would be deposited at the bottom of the bath.. . 1888 The first aluminium companies founded in France, Switzerland and the USA. . 1889 Karl Josef Bayer (Austria), son of the founder of the Bayer chemical company, invented the Bayer Process for the large scale production of alumina from bauxite.. . 1900 Annual output 8 thousand tonnes.. . 1913 Annual output 65 thousand tonnes.. . 1920 Annual output 128 thousand tonnes.. . 1938 Annual output 537 thousand tonnes.. . 1946 Annual output 681 thousand tonnes.. . 1999 Annual output 24 million tonnes.. . Aluminium has only been produced commercially for 146 years and is still a very young metal. Mankind has been using copper, lead and tin for thousands of years and yet today more aluminium is produced than all other non-ferrous metals combined. Annual primary production in 1999 was about 24 million tonnes and secondary - recycled - production to some 7 million tonnes. The total of some 31 million tonnes compares with 14.1 million tonnes of copper , 6.0 million tonnes of lead and 0.2 million tonnes of tin .

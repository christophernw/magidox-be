You're right - in response to them beheading Americans, we should...what? Hug them into submission? Try to explain that we really DO understand why they hide behind women and children? Tell them that it's okay to hide in mosques and even better when they attack us from the mosques?. . Do you really think an American (or British, or Canadian) POW will be treated as kindly by their captors as the US is treating the detainees in Gitmo? Will the Americans be given a Bible or a Torah if requested? Will the "freedom fighters" cater to their captive's religious dietary needs, if any? Do you think Americans captured by Islamic fanatics will gain weight during their captivity? . . If American, British, or any Allied soldier commits a crime, he or she should certainly be held accountable. But until the other side learns to fight like men and not like lying, sniveling cowards, spare us the self-righteousness. I stand behind my troops and my country.

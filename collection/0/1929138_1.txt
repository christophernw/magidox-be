A couple of things can happen, depending on the person and how far from the TV they are.. 1.  If you stare at anything too long you can forget to blink and your eyes can dry out.  This doesn't really damage them but it can be very uncomfortable.. 2.  If you stare at a fixed distance for too long, especially if it's close up, the muscles in the eye will get imbalanced.  This is a common cause of myopia (nearsightedness).  Since this can be fixed with glasses, contact lenses, or surgery it's not really a big deal.

Train your puppy to use the bathroom on the newspaper until it gets used to going outside. They also sell puppy pads but can be costly. Newspaper works fine for me, I am house training my 6 month old jack russell. . . It works if you slowly take away the newspaper and they will learn to use it on one spot each time the have an accident. I like the keep the paper in the bathroom.

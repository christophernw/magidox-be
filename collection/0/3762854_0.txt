Your voice raises when you inhale helium, because it is less dense than the air that you breath normally.  Since it is less dense, the speed of sound is higher, this makes the pitch rise. Air is mostly nitrogen (atomic weight 7), which is 350% heavier than helium (atomic weight 2). So, about 350% higher.

The last I looked was about 6 or 7  years ago, but at the time a 3 Br house in Yonkers near where I lived was sold for 225,000. . Around the same time frame, my parents sold my childhood home...a 4br 2 car garage corner lot, much nicer neiborhood and schools than were in Yonkers for 167,000.  I realize prices have skyrocketed since then, but the difference probably is still on par.

Knowing is different from believing in that believing often deals with unseen or expected issues where as knowledge deals with empirical data and evidence. You know something because several others, if not all- "Everybody knows that", know it is true as well. Belief does not depend on, but can be fortified with, collaborative reinforcement. It is enough that you know, believe, it is true.

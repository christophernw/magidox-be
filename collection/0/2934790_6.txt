does he still have the litter box insse, if not, maybe you need to replace it.   Also he  may be used to going anywhere he wants outside and assumes tht is ok inside.  Remember, there are lots of things outside that are dangerous for cats. including lots of things that are poisin, dogs,cars, people that are retarded and will purposefully do harm to your cat.  not to mention lots of diseases and ferreal cats that can fight w/ yours.  please use caution when you leave your cats outdoors.

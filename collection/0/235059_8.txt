There's no such thing as dog liter but I read they can learn something similar. Nowadays there are small grass carpets you can put at home where they can go. You have to change them often but they can go if you are not around to take them out. Dogs are very intelligent animals and one of my friends trained her dog to use a "dog toilet". But I have to say this, a dog can learn, but it will take a lot of time of training. Other thing, (and the most important) is that the time you spend going out with the dog is very important, don't force the dog too much. If you definitely don't have the time, you better get a cat.

My professor discussed this in an "Art and Culture" class once.  As I understand it, it's the other way around.  The socio-economic state of these countries make them excellent breeding grounds for Islam.  It is the religion that ~seems to them~ to court their situation the best.  . . Not trying to compare in as insulting a way as possible, but it's kind of like Hitler's dogma at the time was exactly what the German people needed to hear.  They were poor, starving, demoralized and humiliated.  Hitler preached power, prosperity and pride, and a *whole nation* ate it up.  Human nature, same the world over.

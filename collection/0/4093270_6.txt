Shampoo much much longer, Scrub harder, Rinse longer, scrubbing motion during the rinse as well. If you can stratch your scalp and see flakes after you're done and drying with the towel then just get right back in and do it again. If not after the first time of all that rigorous scrubbing, the 2nd time will definitely have your head spotless.

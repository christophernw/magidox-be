You must be a religious person.  . . First of all the word 'genius' is very much overused and abused.  Its hard to make any general statement about any large loosely defined population much less asserting that they are mostly geniuses.. . I know very little about you but I can see that your question uses poor grammar.. . Many geniuses are actually religious men.  Einstein was a Christian.  Rene Descartes was considered a genius and very devout.  Even among the Greek philosophers, very few of them were atheists.  Most of them were devout pagans.. . If you are going to phrase your comment as a question, please be a little more accurate.  You are giving atheists a bad name, or was that your intention?

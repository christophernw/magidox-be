First of all, cats are very smart animals.  For some reason, this particular purple ball has cought Kitty's attention.. . It is most likely that smell plays an important role.  My guess is either that the purple ball has a smell that he likes, or that the other toys have a smell he doesn't like.  Can you notice if they have a plastic or rubber smell?  For some reason, animals are deterred by those particular scents.. . Lastly, don't worry about finding another; one is enough.  After all, it is his favorite for a reason, so allow him to enjoy his favorite toy.  Eventually it may wear out, and he'll learn to love another.. . Hope this helps!

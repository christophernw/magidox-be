"It is possible, of course, to keep. educated people unfree in a state of civilization, but it's. much easier to keep ignorant people unfree in a state. of civilization. And it is easiest of all if you can. convince the ignorant that they are educated, for you. can thus make them collaborators in your disposition. of their liberty and property. That is the institutionally. assigned task, for all that it may be invisible to those. who perform it, of American public education.". . (From THE GRAVES OF ACADEME by Richard Mitchell)

You must not have ever gone to Mexico, right? . 1. Poverty -- the people sometimes make as little as a dollar a day.  There are few, if any social programs to help them. . 2. Government oppression- if you don't agree with the people in power, you run the risk of "disappearing". . 3. Drug cartels -they run the country and kill each other off regularly, and if you happen to be in the way .. you too. . . The government  is corrupt - what do people expect when police make something like 400 a MONTH?  . Easy money=corrupt cops and chaos. . When they come over here- a female (just by being a housekeeper) can make over 100 a week- that is like being rich to them.  . . i live on the border.  We see it everyday.

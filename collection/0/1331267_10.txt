Peace?what kind?short term peace or an ever lasting one?Well,ostensibly everybody wants peace,particularly world leaders.Want one "concrete" example? 'The War On Terror'of . the Bush administration.War for peace!That's their only "diplomatic" solution!But let's be realistic.The history of mankind is the history of wars.Great leaders is perpetually justifying their cause or selfish motive by shameleesly uttering the holy word 'peace'.War is not the means to attain peace.To attain peace,well,one should make sure that there's peace within oneself.Hah!but man is self-centered & aggressive,am wasting my time here talking about peace while there,in Iraq,the death toll is still escalating and in Palestine,Hamas is still refusing to get involved in peace talks with Israel!I firmly believe that to attain peace,wisdom is needed,but,sadly to say,this is precisely what our leaders lack today!As far as women are concerned,definitely the world will be different from what it is now!According to the magazine,Newzweek,the World Economic Forum found,in a study of just three countries,that women wanted more money for health care,education and social welfare,and less for the military.So, you can imagine the drastic change!But our men leaders squander money in the military instead of tackling pressing health problems like AIDS.So ponder upon it,here is two diplomatic solutions to obtain an ever lasting peace;wisdom & women!And by the way,that canadian woman president who messed up things is a rare case,perchance,the only 1 up to now!History is a clear witness that women rule better than men.What about Margaret Thatcher & Suhbaataryn Yanjmaa?And now Angela Merkel,Let's wait and watch what she does and how she rules!May be we are confronting another Thatcher.Peace is surely a simple word,but to attain it,each and everyone,particularly our leaders & diplomats,should see to it that peace is not only for others but for him/her as well and that it's not merely a word found in the dictionary but a word which manifests itself in our interraction with others and in our actions!

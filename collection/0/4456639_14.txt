Because creatures evolve to fit into ecological niches. If another animal evolves and fits into the nich better then he can force out the previous animal.. But since we don't eat jungles grasses like many of the greater apes and depend more on meat in our deits we don't push out many of our ape cousins.. We may have pushed out a close ancestor, the Neanderthal man, but there is no evidence.

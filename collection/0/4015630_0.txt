Clouds are not green because of hail.  Though green coloured cluds often do have hail.  They are green because they contain a lot of water, and are back lit by sunlight at sunset, which is coloured red.  The blue coloured water filters out the long wavelength red colours, and all the blue short wavelength has already been scattered by the atmosphere.  Thus the remaining colour is predominantly green.

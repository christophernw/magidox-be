If you bought the car new or, if the person you bought the car from bought it new you can get the key codes off the original bill of sale.. Then take that to a locksmith to have them make the key.. . . Another thing you can do is get the VIN number off the car,. and go to a dealer that sells your type of car and see if they can look up the key codes from the vin number.

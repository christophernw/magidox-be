Laws are set up to protect the wealthy and the powerful - they are designed as a tool of oppression and are only fair to the extent that the need to be for the masses not to realise how biased they really are.. Punishment as a deterant removes the need for personal morality and is therefore in itself morally inexcusable.  If people were taught virtue through example they would not need a legal system as we would be able to sensibly solve our problems.

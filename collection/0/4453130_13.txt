Christian=Christ like  I can ask you the same thing you asked, Did Christ teach to criticize other churches?  Yet it seems you are doing the exact thing you are telling others Christ did not do by saying yours is the only church that is Christian.  Jesus said, "there are other sheep I have that are not of this fold."  Does this sound like only one church will be presented in Heaven?  There are Christians in every church, not just one and a true Christian would not be telling others they are not going to be a Christian just because they are not of their church affilliation.  If you want to talk universal, you best check on your facts as the Catholic church is not the only universal church there is that is all around the world.  It may be the biggest but it does not mean all are going to Heaven that belong to it or that it is the best or only one.  narrow is the gate that leads to salvation and FEW there be that find it but wide is the gate of destruction and many there are that will find it.  Best get a bible and start reading it to see what God says about it.

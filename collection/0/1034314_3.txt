I aggree with Max.. . There isn't a definite way to know someone is gay. Do you think that by asking, that person would plainly say "yes" to someone who is just curious, then would possibly mock him/her because saying the truth? . . Gaydar does exist. With this, and seeing someone's attitude/response in certain things.. then maybe you can guess that someone tends to be gay. The stereotype feminine guy or masculine gal doesn't mean that person must be gay.

Maybe because he feels like it. . I wonder... what is the point of specifying that he is a black man. If it was a white man, would you have asked "why is a white man walking down my street singing?" I seriously doubt it. Why don't you ask him? How would we know why he's singing?. . Sorry... but I still think you're full of $hit. Believe it or not... there are a lot of black people who are racist against other blacks. I don't know if you're black or not. I don't know a whole lot of black girls named Amy. And I don't really understand why you avatar is a white girl with a cowboy hat. . Either way... I still don't understand the point of specifying his race. And, if you are black, and if you are on Yahoo Answers frequently, you should know that the way you phrased the question basically opens yourself up to a bunch of dumb ass racist remarks. Like the guy who said something about the guy being on crack. Geeez... act like you have some sense.

Really ask yourself, though, how many people can listen to analysis and for how long. Everybody is concerned over a hand full of issues that apply to them, but when a speech writer or a commercial producer covers that topic, they know that they have about ten words to do it in, and anything else is going to be too long-winded, and will be ignored, because nobody has a long enough attention span. They advertise themselves to us the fastest way that there possibly is to advertise in a few seconds, instead of racking their brains to come up with a more effective way, by calling their opposition the worst things that they can in a thirty-second spot.. . My husband is working for a local candidate in our state. The winner of this race will determine whether or not we continue to have property taxes. That's a big issue! Yet the only advertisements we've seen so far are "trust me" or "don't trust him". It makes you wonder whether anybody knows anything that's at stake.

A vegetarian Dalmatian. . . Because he has 17 allergies and the former owner wanted to put him to sleep at the tender age of 4 months old, and I didn´t want to do it so I kept him. He was also suffering of mal nutrition, pododermatitis, 5 different endoparasites and fleas.. . He´s just fine now, very loveable and healthy.

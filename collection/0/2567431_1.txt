Primary care, in terms of health care, is the field in which a doctor is the "primary physician" caring for a person.  What that job entails is that the physician understands the patient's general medical condition very well, and then treats all of the patient's basic medical problems.  For any more complicated problems, the primary care physician refers the patient off to specialist doctors.. . So, in short, primary care is the "regular" general doctor.  If you're an adult, it's an internal medicine doctor, if you're a child, it's the pediatrician.  If you're a young, healthy woman, it's the gynecologist.

Well if you have one, turn down the thermostat on the heater.. Another trick would be not to have the tank near a window.  Sunlight will heat the water if allowed to shine on the tank.. . If you need to take the temp down quickly, start adding some ice cubes to the water... not a lot all at once... just a few at a time so the fish can adjust to the change slowly.

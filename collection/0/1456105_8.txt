Every day I work, I feel close to God, and I feel His presence working through me.  I'm a Nurse Assistant in a hospital that caters to the underpriveliged, especially meth addicts and alcoholics, and homeless folks.  . . I can be working with dirty people with scabies, fleas, lice, and all manner of diseases, but by smiling and treating society's outcasts with respect, and kindness, I feel that God has made a difference in their lives through me.. . "A joyful heart makes a cheerful face" -Proverbs 15:13

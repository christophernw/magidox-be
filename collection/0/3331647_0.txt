I dont know what kind of detail you want since you listed no specifics what-so-ever of your experiment or the accompanying math that goes with it... all i can tell you is this based on your explanation.. . You are calculating an experimental value, and you condtitions working with heat of fusion for ice are probably not optimal for the test.  In cases where you are not using the proper equipment, a % of error for an experimental value are easily acceptable within 10%... sometimes even more % of error is acceptable.  The only way to decrease your experimental % of error is to reformat the experiment to be of greater accuracy, or else your math is wrong... but again, since you give no specifics I can not give you a definite answer.. . To get a more accurate reading you need to control more of the variables for the experiment... such as temperature of the surrounding environment, the type of thermometer you are using for the experiment... etc. and build those into your equasion for finding % of error.

Life is a matter of survival of the fittest; and every cell in your body is striving to survive except those that must sacrifice for your wellbeing (hair and dead skin, etc.).  That is an awesome responsibility to look out for over a billion cells that depend on you.  And they have a right to be here; as much right as the stars and the trees.  And if you find a purpose for your life you will want to be here too.

It takes time and patience to train puppies.  I have a Yorkie who is 8.5 mos old and basically is trained.  I work all day so can't spend a lot of time with him.  Take your pups outside as much as you can and often.  Take them to the same spot each time so they get the message.  Mine was paper trained for the first while and then I switched to the pee pads and they are very effective.  You can buy a spray at pet stores or Walmart that you spray on the area you want them to use.  Some people have sucess litter training their dogs as well.  I tried that but all he wanted to do was play with the litter.   Crate training is also good as they usually don't pee where they sleep but when they are young their little bladders don't hold it in as long as when they get older.  Rule of thumb.  1 month old...1 hour     2 month's old.....2 hours  etc etc.. I keep my little guy confined to my large kitchen when I'm gone which is about 9-10 hours a day and most days he's able to hold it until I get home.  I leave  a pee pad just in case.  . Most dogs want to please us so never hit them and never punish them unless you catch them in the act.  Once it registers that they are only to "go" outside it will make your life so much easier.  Good Luck.

A Suana is a small room or house designed as a place to experience wet or dry heat sessions deriving from the Finnish suana. Also used as a verb describing the act of using a sauna or metiphoricaly describing an unusually hot or humid enviroment.. A steam room would be the same as a steam shower. Water vapor is produced using a humidifying steam generator providing a pleasant bathing experience.. So in the long run, if you want to sweat real good and feel it, try a sauna but, if you still want to sweat and have it basically washed off, then try a steam room.

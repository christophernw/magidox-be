As far as I know, negro is originally a term derived from the Spanish and first used in English in the US to describe Africans forced to work as slaves. For this reason, it is mostly regarded as a term of abuse and is definitely not a term anyone should use to describe anybody.. It is then a social distinction, not a so called racial one.. Scientifically, there is no basis whatsoever to support that mankind is divided in different races. Once again, this is a social construct, no more, no less.. A long time ago, different groups of people settled down in various parts of the world. Over time, through marriage, they developed similar physical characteristics, the same way that I look like my sisters and also like both my parents, but not so much like my cousins. Yet, we are all part of the same family. there are blacks, whites, blondes, brunettes and redheads, tall and short people, fat and thin etc, but we are all equal and have the same capacity to invent, feel, experiment and contribute to the whole of mankind.

Small claims court is the one and only place where it is ok to represent yourself. A lawsuit again something as big as a corportaion needs the aid of a lawyer. Don't play Perry Mason unless you are in fact a lawyer.. It may cost you plenty after the trail if you bungle this case yourself, much more than a real lawyer's fee and court costs.

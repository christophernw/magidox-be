when i took my training classes they had me put my puppy on a long leash and have her sit and stay, then i would tell her to come and give her a small treat... then back up and keep doing it, you need to practice atleast 20 min a day and it will only take a day or two ,and then you can try it with the leash off... it works really well!  good luck!

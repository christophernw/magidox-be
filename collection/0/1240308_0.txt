I think you meant to say Parlimentary government. Parlimentary govt. is the form of govt. in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.It is composed of the House of lords, and the house of commons.. . I think that the Japanese Govt.is an imperialistic form of govt.Imperialism is sort of like a dictatorship.

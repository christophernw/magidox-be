a lot of times people want to find that perfect present usually for their kids , and they think what better way than to buy a cute and adorable puppy, and they get so caught up in the emotional aspect of it that they forget to do their research. yes, puppies are adorable...but when the novelty of owning a pup is over you have to deal with the responsibility of ownership and a lot of people are unwilling to do it. leading to a dog with tons of issues and unhappy owners.. I am not trying to convince you not to buy a pup.....just be knowledgeable of what you are committing to...it is an investment of not only money, but time...time for training, exercising, and everything else that goes along with it for the next 10+ years. if you have already considered this and know exactly what type of pup you want and have done the research on the breed to find the right one that will fit into your family's lifestyle start looking into reputable breeders, breed rescues.. Good Luck...and Happy Holidays!

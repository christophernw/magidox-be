Eating three or four times a day is to your stomach as dripping water is to a stone or iron. The dripping water will eventually wear a stone and iron away. But, just to look at the water, it does not appear powerful enough in its dripping to wear the stone and iron away. It is the same with food; we continuously put it into our stomachs to be digested and eventually it will destroy the stomach. If we let our stomachs rest a while and gain strength, they will last longer in doing a job of digesting food for us . . for the details.http://www.seventhfam.com/temple/books/eattolive_one/eat1_10.htm

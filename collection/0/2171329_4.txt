Well you could try (it wouldnt be easy) but if you aren't being your true self then people will see you as a fake then no one will respect you. I am guessing you want to change for someone other than yourself (your parents or maybe to make your crush like you)? If you are too loud, just try toning it down or if your shy make an effort to speak to more people. But to change yourself is loosing your integrity and if people dont like you as you are, then they aren't worth your time.

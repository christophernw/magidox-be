Just keep doing what YOU want to do, and doing what you love to do, and it will one day lead you to something that makes your "life calling" so clear. Sometimes, one interest leads you to another, and that is how you're supposed to find it, so don't feel discouraged if you can't really tell what you are supposed to be doing right now. Maybe you still need to go through some experiences to give you a certain outlook or to lead you to something you NEVER would even consider at this current point in your life.

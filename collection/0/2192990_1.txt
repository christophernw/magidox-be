If the bats are fruit bats, give them fruit. If you're not really sure about it, give them little pieces of... mangoes, bananas, maybe even oranges. Try finding books about  the bats if you can't find what species they are or ask someone about what species they are. I recommend a zoologist. Sometimes, the bats could eat insects, you can watch the bats eat the little pesky flies or moths.

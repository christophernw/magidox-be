Adam and Eve are used to symbolize humanities first turn from "God." Where in our confusion to better ourselves, we always end up doing the exact opposite. Adam and Eve's sins can still be seen today, all of humanity is falling apart in an attempt at peace. This all happens because nature is about balance, but humanity only strives for peace. Also this is why all other things in existence flow while humanity struggles. We aren't higher beings, we are more like confused children.

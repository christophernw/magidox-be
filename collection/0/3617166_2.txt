I'm with you in that I also do not believe illegal immigrants should be allowed to sue anyone in the USA.  The way I look at it, they committed the first crime by being in the country illegally and if they had not done so, whatever "wrong" was done to them could not have been done, so they are responsible for having "caused" any wrong to be done to them by being here illegally, in the first place.  As soon as they file a lawsuit and their illegal status is revealed, I think they should be immediately deported.  Let them continue with their lawsuit from their home country, if they still want to.

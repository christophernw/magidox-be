i watched something on a documentary not so long ago about a little girl who would sweat profusely from her hands and feet. They put her feet in water with some kind of electrical current running through (obviously not enough to hurt you), and it stopped her feet sweating, although i don't think it was permanent. Don't try this at home!!! It was done by some kind of medical professional.

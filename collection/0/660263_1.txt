That is not an easy task.  Each time you make a contribution, you need to record the date and the amount of shares that you purchased with each contribution.  You can do this on yahoo finance, except there is no recording of dates so you can not calculate your annual return.  A spread sheet or one of the personal finance packages will also work.

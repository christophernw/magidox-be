I suffer from migraines also.. I have tried tiger balm on the temples and forehead or an ice pack and lie in a dark room.. This will only help me if the migraine is not too severe otherwise the only remedy for me is a strong migraine tablet......Mersyndol... it must be taken as soon as the signs that the migraine is coming or else you will have to go with the first suggestion.. . If you take the medication as soon as the triggers begin you shouldn't get nauseated. You would only get nauseated if the migraine is set in.. . I hope it works because I believe there is nothing worse than a migraine, it is so debilitating.. . I feel for you.

There are two flaps opposite each other that vibrate. I knew someone who was a choral singer and had a cold once that caused one flap to vibrate at a different frequency than the other. As she said, it was the only time in her life she could sing a chord!. . Anyway, if you watch the science channel faithfully enough they might eventually show a flick where they stick a camera down someone's throat and you can see it for yourself. A Google search might take fewer months than that however.

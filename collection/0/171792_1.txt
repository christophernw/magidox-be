i think because it was an avi file, u can't get d visual (just audio). usually i don't like receiving files my phone (K750i) doesn't support unless i can convert them on d PC Suite so maybe u didn't follow the converting process well (cos to think of it, if u converted avi to mp4, then it should give u visuals.) my advice, convert it to 3gp, i'm sure u'll get ur full video with this file format aight, peace.

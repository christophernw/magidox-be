OK.. so I'm Canadian and just sit back and watch as George bush runs the US into the ground! The man is a complete idiot! The man should have never been president ... he doesn't know how to make a good decision to save his life! ... seriously if you want to know a good take on George bush watch "Fahrenheit 911" .... it say it all!

Someone once told me that it has to do with the electrical tension of the coin. When that is wrong, the machine will spit it out again. you can change the tension of the coin by rubbing it against metal, such as the side of the vending machine. I don't know it this is actually true, this guy didn't look all that trustworthy, to be honest.

Hi,.     I have had to clean coffee pots etc. which have been in fires. Plastic when it gets stained is almost impossible to clean because the stain isn`t only on the surface . One thing you can try is a good industrial degreaser like 2100 or 363 ;be careful as it is powerful!!wear rubber gloves .Place the lid in water just covering it add about 1/4 cup of degreaser and let it sit .rinse after a couple hours if the there is a difference you can repeat the operation.The only other option is chlorine bleach .Do NOT mix these .Use them seperately and only after rinsing the lid and sink  with clean water.remember working with chemicals to ALWAYS follow label directions

The very first known artwork began about 3,500 years ago and it is simple animals and crude people on cave walls and ceilings.  Not long after their appear to be lots of drawings of women with a large focus on fertility.  Fertility remains an important theme for a few centuries.  Well I can't give you the entire history, it'll take forever but I hope that this gets you started.

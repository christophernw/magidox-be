It has something to do with when something very famous happened. Unfortunately I don't remember what that event was. Something like the time Lincoln died, the Titanic sunk, something along those lines. I think it is older than the Titanic, though. . . Opinion, it also shows that both hands are there, in the upper half of the watch.

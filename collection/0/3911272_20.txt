the media is a private orginazation in this country. they say they are fair and balanced but they arent because they dont have to be. the media says what it wants to say, most of what they say is blantent lies, for instance something that got practicly NO media coverage(because the media wouldnt report their own screw up). in 2004 a reporter of cbs said that americans shot and killed 6 iraqi CITIZEN CIVILIANS, they were really terrorists loaded with bombs dressed in civilian clothes. media blantenly lied to america about that. never ever trust what they say, watching the news is like watching a movie, they only present one side of the story. I think its funny when the media says we are "mistreating TERRORISTS in guantanamo" while the media never says anything bad about what the terrorists are doing to our soldiers. its war...get over it people. sh*t happens. as far as the stuff thats good going on in iraq, thers alot. every day our reason for entering is justified, we have found mass graves made by saddam hussien and we have found documents and facilitys for weapons of mass destruction. sorry the bias in our media pisses me off.

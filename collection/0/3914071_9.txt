If I remember correctly, a 400 engine block is bigger than a 350. . . A 400 has more cylinders and requires more spark plugs. . . I THINK a 350 has 6 cylinders, therefore it only requires 6 spark plugs. A 400 has 8 and requires 8 spark plugs.. . Maybe there is a site to visit that can give you better answers.. . OOHH!!! I just thought of something..... . What year, make and model is it ? Yes, it does make a difference.. . You should be able to find a site for the specific make and model ie; Ford F-150; Chevy Blazer, etc. Try it. Let us know how it worked out.. . Good Luck!

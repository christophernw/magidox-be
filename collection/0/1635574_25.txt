First, be certain you are very well informed on the topic about which you are speaking. The more knowledge you have on your subject, the less nervous you'll be talking about it. Next, practice your speech in front of a mirror and/or in front of friends and family and wear a rubber band around one wrist. Lightly snap the rubber band every time you say "ah". Do this as many times as it takes to stop saying it.

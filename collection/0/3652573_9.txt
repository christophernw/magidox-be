i want to say that . we have to be very happy about the women rights now our country is developing day by day . and if we dont happy with this  women rights work god will never fogive us coz now our woman have lots of freedom now than AFGHANISTAN  and too much countries uncountable . our woman can go out and this is very very good thg . if u see in AFGHANISTAN woman even cant go outsite . only when their father or bro anythg else go by her and also with CHADARI not too much same like burqa. so we have to b proud. My mother is from INDIA but my father is from AFGHANISTAN . but my father is high level graduated so he is a bit mmm 60 70 % open minded so he has let my mother free (50 60%). so but we have to work hard this and have to improve it..........................

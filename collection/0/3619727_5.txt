It's an infection, similair to a yeast infection, you need to see the vet to get a cleaning solution and clean the ears, be careful they are sore and may bother the dog. The best way is to squirt the solution in the ear, rub the ear a bit, and roll up a paper towel so that the end is sort of pointed, use that end to rub along inside the ear wiping up the guck. This si common in alot of breeds, if your dog continues to get them, you might look intoo changing the food, sometimes a wheat free food helps eliminate the infection

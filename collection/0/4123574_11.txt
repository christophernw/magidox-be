I think that Bush really is in a bubble.  I believe that he mis read how frustrated moderates and dems are.  He beleives his own press and it backfired on him.  I am not feeling like the Dems are going to give us a earth shaking alternative.  but peope are very frustrated at Rummy.  Bush did not or could not hear it.

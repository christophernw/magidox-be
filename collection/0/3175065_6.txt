poodles pick one person to be with and only one. they bond with that person.kids tend to make them nervese. mine is very attached to me, the rest of the family can still pet/play with him but he never leaves my sight. he wants to go every where i go at all times. if your not ready for that levle of commitment, don't get a poodle. they are like taking care of a baby. i love it, but my kids are teenagers. when i babysit my poodle hides from the little kids 2-6yrs old. they are not really a family dog.

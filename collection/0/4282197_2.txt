Unlawful generally relates to civil law, whereas illegal generally concerns criminal law. Examples:. . 1. Under civil tort law, a plaintiff may sue for unlawful private nuisance if a defendant neighbor burns tires in his/her suburban backyard.. . 2. Under the Penal Code, it is illegal to burn tires anywhere within State boundaries, without first obtaining an license from the State Environmental Protection Agency.. . A reasonably survey of appellate court case law opinions will quickly demonstrate that judges rarely associate "unlawful" in a criminal law opinion, and never use "illegal" when writing a civil law opinion. So, contrary to what Madison posts above, it's not the general public that necessarily distinguishes between the two words, but rather it is the courts that do so routinely.

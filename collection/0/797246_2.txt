do something or go somewhere where you would normally ever go because you feel totally out of place. . . Randomly start a conversation with someone.. . Do something dangerous.. . Go buy a homeless man some food then sit and talk to him. . Go sing karioke at a bar. . . I don't know what you're like, so I can't tell you exactly what to do, but yea...something people would be really surprised by if they heard you did it.

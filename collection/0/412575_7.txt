She could just be a really vocal cat. And if she is an indoor cat, that could be why. She is probably whinning, because she wants to go outside... or if she is whinning and sticking her A$$ in the air it could be because she is in heat. If she doesn't stop, and you can't figure out why, just bring her to a vet.

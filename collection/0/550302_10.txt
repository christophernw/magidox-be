Who said that you can't be certain about what truth is, by using experience? How do you know that he is telling you the truth? These are not sarcastic questions.. . I suspect it was your professor who told you this. if you ask 10 different professors or 10 different philosophers, you will get 10 different answers. What is the logical conclusion to be drawn from this? You can't trust what ANY professor or what any philosopher says.. . One thing I know; that I AM and that there is an ultimate reality. If there was no ultimate reality, then, I would not exist. Whether I am a butterfly or a human, there is still the I, that experiences this. That I, is who I am.. . There was an idea that started to become popular in the Middle ages; that all truth could be known by logic and reason. That idea is now in full flower. The idea is absurd. All logic is based on premises that are supposed to be self evident. . . The problem is, that what one person thinks is self evident, even if they are a college professor or famous philosopher, may not be self evident to different person.. . A person must be a critical reader and listener, as well as a critical thinker, to be able to separate useful ideas from the garbage they tell you while you are in college.. . You must be a clear thinker to have asked such a good question.

It's "allegory" in both "covenants": Galatians 4. written "aforetime" for our "learning": Romans 15. notably written as "mystery" to solve "in time",. lest all the KofG within you perish from law law;. which is to say perish from yer "willing ignorance".. . The God of "all grace" make you perfect(merciful). after ye(do err) suffer awhile in yer law law.. . The "grace" of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.

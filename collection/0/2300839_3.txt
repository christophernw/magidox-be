Do you love Jesus? Is He in your heart? Do you want to learn the Word? Do not forsake the gathering of the saints. Ask God to show you a body of believers that will help you grow.. . BTW-If you do NOT have a personal walk with Jesus, then going to church will not help you very much. If you want to know Jesus, take care of that first.

I know a single mom who was having a hard time like this, and working 3 jobs so her kids could have and be in all the things they wanted. She got into network marketing and now only does that and her family has more than they have ever had. I just got into this also and are very happy with being my own boss and having time and money for my family. But you have to be careful and do your homework and the companies, some are bad, some are ok, and some are great. You can find info on the one I work with on www.newbodybalnace.com.

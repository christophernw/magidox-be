the signs are all around you just as the signs of winter or of rain. Look around  how much more cruelty can the world stand?  There are people suffering and dying right now and no one is doing a single thing to help them  Drought and Plague and Famine already stalk the world and Death is reaping in like never before.  Tell me you don't believe the end is coming and I will thirstily listen to your words and search for hope.

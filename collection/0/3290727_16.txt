since he's just new kitty in your house, he's still afraid of you. first, try to give him food direct from your hand, not put in his bowl, by doing it, you will let him to approach you and after several days, he will be used to doing it and closer and closer to you until he let you hold him.. . Scold him when he tries to claw your leather furniture. that works for my cats. But once you scold him, never ever let him sit or sleep on your sofa, so that he will know that the area is forbidden forever, he will not even dare to touch it.. once you let him touch him again, he will claw it all over and your scold will not work anymore..

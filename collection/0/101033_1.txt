Tell him straight up. "Dude, you're feet stink, go take a shower or somethin. Don't come back here till they don't stink.". . It might be his shoes. When he ain't lookin hook the inside of his shoes up with some baking soda or somethin. Usually shoes get that way if you wear your shoes without socks more than you should.

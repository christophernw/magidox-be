If you really know your sports teams, then just bet on games aganist your friends or play Proline (a lottery game in Canada) and you can score alot of money from that, get a job or if you have one then a 2nd job!! I want PS3 too, but Im willing to wait 2 years for it when the price goes down and games are cheaper!!!!!!!

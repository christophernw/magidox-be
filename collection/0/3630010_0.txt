I am studying French through night courses at a local college because Canada is billingual (English and French), because I live in an area with a large Francophone popluation and because I love speaking French!. . I am also studying Funeral Services Education through correspondence because I have wanted to be a funeral director since I was like 12 and I am going to try really hard to make this dream happen!

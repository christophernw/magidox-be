That is a "scam" that has been around since TV was black and white. The FCC excuse for letting it go on is that commercials can be local or from any network feed and so that equipment is not set at the same levels as the network show. Really, it just is to get your attention for the commercial (they presume you may be sleeping through the show, I guess.) There are TVs that can correct that and TVO does a good job with it. The rest of us just grab the remote and turn it down.

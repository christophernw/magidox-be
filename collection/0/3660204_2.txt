This is definitely a real thing.  It's especially pungent when it hasn't rained in a while.. . I believe the reason we smell the rain is that as storms evolve, and the rain falls and cools, moistens, and removes the pollutants in the air, something called an outflow boundary (separating that modified air from the general air around you) moves out ahead of the storm.  You also probably note it get cooler when you smell the rain.  I believe this is because the outflow boundary has passed you, and the cooler, moister air from the storm is reaching you... which also has a lot of fine water droplets in it.  So you are either smelling the water, or the lack of pollutants that typically build up in the air (rain drops will pull out much of the stuff in the air).. . I can think of some experiences where I've smelled rain but it hasn't ended up raining... so it's not 100% perfect predictor.. . I love that smell!. . Take care,. God bless,. Shane

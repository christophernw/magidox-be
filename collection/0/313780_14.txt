Oh man,is jay walking a felon?And felons dont have thier religion taken away from them..,thats the place where the muslims are recruiting new terrorists.Its true,find out how many convicts are switiching to islam and guess why.No repect for our laws and our traditions.When you commit a crime,you give up your freedom to do alot of things and if its a felon,no voting,no firearms etc.,If you want the right to vote,dont commit a felony,its real simple.

Go to your public library and in the reference section there are SAT study preparation books.  You can use them while sitting in the library.. . If your schedule allows for it, try to spend 30-45 minutes five days a week working on one section at a time.  . . I know that my local library has Kaplan Study Guides, you may also find Princeton Review Study Guides.

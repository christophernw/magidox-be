The basic method is to observe its position over several nights.  The subsequent motion of the comet against the background stars is then fitted to a curve that describes the orbit.  The difficulty with this method is that a elliptical orbit can resemble a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit at certain sections of the orbit.  In the early days of astronomical observations, this closeness made it difficult to determine if a comet was in a closed, periodic orbit or whether it would be on an escape path from the Solar System.

There is no general consensus on the purpose of pubic hair but I think that the reason it has evolved (parts of the human body do not have to have a function, e.g. nipples on men) is to attract the opposite sex. There are two ways it does this. It is a sign that the person is capable of producing gametes: eggs or sperm. It also acts as a pheromone trap. In this case these are scented chemicals that will attract the opposite sex. So its main role is likely to be in the attraction of a partner and hence the propagation of the species.

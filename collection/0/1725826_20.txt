I think a lot of it has to do with the way the questions are asked. Many adults get bugged by "empty" questions, not realizing that this is just another form of entertainment for many of the younger set. Us "old farts" often forget what it was like to be in junior high (or younger). I have the unique gift of being married to a big kid. He drives a school bus and is sometimes a bigger kid than those he's driving. Makes for some interesting times around here, that's for sure! We like having fun and tend to remember those younger days, when we had to entertain ourselves when things got boring. I think the adults need to chill a while, and remember to not take everything so seriously. Pick and choose the battle more carefully. I'm a Sunday School teacher, so I enjoy hanging with kids and having fun. And I like being on this site, helping those who need help, and sometimes setting people straight who need a little "attitude adjustment" to their day. I realize that many young people aren't really that interested in grammar and spelling, and that's something that annoys many of the adults. I try to look past that, but sometimes it's hard, because I work hard at getting things right (sometimes it doesn't always work, though). So, next time you're getting pounded by an adult on this site because of one of your questions, just consider the source. Many of the adults had a rough life and tend to take it out on those who haven't lived much yet. And many of the questions are about sex & how to "do it", which sends many adults into orbit. It's okay to have fun, but some of the "fun" borders on dangerous and just uncouth. But, if you're just having harmless fun, don't worry about the answers to your fun. Just do the best you can, with what you've got and try not to get too annoyed with us. Just remember...some of you might be working at our nursing home some day! <*)))><

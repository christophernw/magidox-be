Right this is why.... potatoes were a strange food that had never been intoduced before to france, not like now a days when you can have all mannor of strange and wonderful things. Now because it was so unusaual people were a little frightened of them, So they were introduced as being like and apple cause everyone knew what they were and liked them, so it took some of the fear away cause an apple of the earth cant be unnatural!! my french teacher told me that (she was an old french lady too to add to the arthantisity of it all) cause like you i wondered why!! hope this answers your question!

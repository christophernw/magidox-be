The Temple itself was colossal and beautifully designed and structured. The statue of Zeus was constructed using a little trick of tweeking the perspective. By progressively enlarging parts of the body it gave you the illusion that the proportions didn't diminish in size as you look up the distance of this very tall seated figure. The statue was adorned with gold and silver and a little known process of creating thin sheets of ivory stretched over the body to look like skin. It was an incredible sight to see and named a wonder of the ancient world. The statue of Lincoln in the Washington was constructed in a similar way as was the seated pose. Paintings of Jesus was depicted in this pose at a later time as was possible the face of Christ as well.

First, you need to determine what type and how many of a each cable type your TV supports.  The typical inputs are HDMI (flat looking connector, single cable), component (three colored cables that look like the cables to connect your stereo), S-video (one multi-pin cable) and composite ( one cable that looks like the cables to connect your stereo).  This should all be in your TV manual.  Then you need to determine the same thing about your cable box and DVD.  Then, hook a compatible cable between the cable box or DVD to the TV.  The list of cables is in the order of quality...so, HDMI is better than component, etc.  If you are using your receiver for sound, then you will also need to run audio cable from the DVD and cable box to the receiver.

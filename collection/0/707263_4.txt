it's not the iPod shuffel.. it's his computer i think that u should take his computer some were, were they can see what is the problem with it because i have a Compaq 2002 model and it lets my iPod shuffel charge and put songs in it.... so, i dont think that there is something wrong with the iPod. that's all i can say... because if it works on your computer and not his.. then, like i said u gotta go fix his computer.

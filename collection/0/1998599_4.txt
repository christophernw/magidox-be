I think it's mostly for flavor and to make them moist.  When I make a cake or cupcakes from a box, I always add a dry pudding mix.  It does make a big difference.  But, I've never heard of putting it in cookies.  I'm sure if you leave it out, they will still come out fine.  But if you add it, that would be good too!!. . As far as a substitute, I don't think you need one.  Either add the pudding, or don't.

There are different types of people in this world, and each race has its own type of people. Some black people choose to be conservative and live a great lifestyle by educating themselves and moving up in the world. Others they like to make fast money and easy money and we see it particularly in many black people, but I guess it just depends on who you are and where you come from. Oprah is a great role model and she grew up dirt poor but look what she has done for herself she has come a long way, I think with other black people they do not want to work hard. I get really frustrated because when I am driving home from school (I go to Howard in DC) I see ONLY black people crossing the streets whenever they feel like it whether there is a car coming or not, and I never see any other race doing that. I don't get it? I mean then they complain about being discriminated against! Its just an example of how there are many types of people in this world and this is how they choose to live their lives its sad

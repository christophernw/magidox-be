lol im not sure what you get taught in america..except your the best but the reason japan attacked america was they were deciding to actually help out europe and assembling the navy hence they were all stuck at pearl habour. knowing this the japanese thought if they could put out the navy america wouldnt be able to enter the war...no transport you see? if you actually take the time out to read a non american book on this your understand that the japanese generals plan would be considered genius and that his only downfall was the fact that he under estimated the attack and should of went on to bomb mainland america, had they the materials and troop power a full scale invasion would of ensured victory for japan. thankfully however they didnt and then gave america the time to lauch a counter attack which exsuated japans resouces fighting on 2 fronts meaning they lost the war. even though eventually europe and russia (plus canada) would of beat germany and italy it would of took years to get into asia and would of bankrupt this side of the world. america later knowing japan was beat seeked revenge and also the title of beating them due to russia only hours away them selves N bombed japan. . THE END

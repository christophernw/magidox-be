Most churches (methodist, episcopal, presbyterian), broke away from the catholic church at one time or another over traditions, ceremonies and beliefs that were added to what the Bible taught. Everybody had their on idea of how to do it. The Baptist and Congregational churches separated from them because we accept only the Bible as our guide - traditions are not as important as the Bible.  And we believe that a personal relationship with Jesus is what makes one a Christian - not being a member of a church.

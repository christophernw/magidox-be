I'm white, but sadly we still NEED affirmative action.  I'm not speaking as a Lib, Dem or any party affiliate.  Just as someone who looks around and sees whats going on.  There are still hurdles to be gotten over in this "good ol' boy" system of government and business.  Not only for other races but for women.  When women and other races receive equal pay and equal oppurtunities then I'll be more than happy to see it go.

As long as they don't damage each other I wouldn't worry, but it's a fair indication if neither of them is actually running away and hiding permanently it's probably play. Actually cat fights are normally preceded by a great deal of showing, arched backs, raised hackles and some very bad language. If yours are just leaping on each other it's probably a game.

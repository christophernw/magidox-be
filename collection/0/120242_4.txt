Need more information.  For a manual transmission, consider the master and slave cylinders.  They could be low on fluid.  There could be air in the lines which will need to be bled off.  Sometimes air will be trapped and it will work for awhile.  Then the air bubble moves and it quites working.. For an automatic transmission, there is a dipstick.  You just need to find it.  Consult a manual.. Either way, unless you take the time to learn more about the vehicle, you will need someone else to correct it.  Bleeding lines is not difficult, but does require knowing what is going on.  You can read a manual and easily do it yourself with a helper.

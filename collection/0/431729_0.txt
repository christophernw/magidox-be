It is common to get nose bleeds at higher altitudes. Most larger aircraft pressurize their cabins. Usually it is pressurized to reproduce what the air pressure is like outside at about 8,000 MSL(or 8,000 feet above sea level).. . So as you ride in an airliner, the air you are breathing is just like you are on top of an 8,000 foot mountain.

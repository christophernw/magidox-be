If you have a nervous disposition in general, not because you are nervous about something specific at that point in time, this can be the cause. I know that a lot of disorders that manifest themselves on the skin but are actually malfunctions in the nervous system. Maybe if you can either test your nervous system to find out for sure, or just try taking herbal mood calmants, they are very mild and it won't hurt to see if over a few weeks of taking them they actually bring about an improvement and save on expensive surgery. Mood stabilisers you can try are Valerian root or St Johns Wort.

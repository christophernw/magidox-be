those are all my specialities.. ok . -locking.. make sure your points are sharp, and work on your wrist rolls, get them fast and clean, and when you do lock make sure you stop, and  make sure your moves are very clear. -krumping.. dont be afriad to let loose, if you feel stupid, your doing it right, krumping is very agressive, so dont tip toe around, cuz it'll make you look bad. -popping.. practice everyday contracting your muscles, hold it for 8 counts at a time so you can get your pops stronger, and make sure when you pop, release quickly so that your other pop will look and be just as strong, and pop with your knees, that always makes your pops look stronger. -breaking.. practice top rocking, and footwork, people will respect you alot more when you do dope footwork, cuz powers are cool to do..  but you gotta know your foundation ok.. but if you wanna know how to windmill make sure your pushing off your hands, and baiscally spinning on your shoulders, and keep your head on the ground. -house.. practice jacking hitting the high hat in the music, its hard to jack and do other dance moves at the same time so get that down good, keep it  funky when housing. if you wanna learn how to glide practice in your sock on tile or wood floors, its hard to explain how to do all this stuff exactly but let me know if you need more help good luck!!!!

May refer to "Electromagnetic Compatibility". An older term was "Electromagnetic Interference" or EMI. These are electric, magnetic or electromagnetic fields that are coupling into and out of electronic equipments and circuitries undesirably via either "conducted" or "radiated" transmission coupling paths. Typically these undesired radiated or conducted signals are controlled by designing the host to meet EMI/EMC performance specifications including the use of shielding enclosures, gasketing and EMI/EMC filters.

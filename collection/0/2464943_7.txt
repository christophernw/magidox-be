Very doubtful they would be interested in helping you out, toy stores are in business for profit, not losing sales.  Most toy stores have "Toys for tots" drop boxes to which purchased toys can be donated by their paying customers.  Don't mean to sound discouraging, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.

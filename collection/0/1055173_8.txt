No people will not believe you, well then again some people would. However, people believe the Bible when they are looking to have an actual encounter with God or have had one already and they have come to trust in The Lord. . . For me personally I have had many moments in the presence of JEHOVAH and God continues to prove Himself to us again and again. I remember when God answered mine and my mother's prayer for this kid at school. His aunt was brutally beaten and claimed dead and she was revived after our prayer.. .  There are also those people who believe in God out of hypocrisies. Jesus said in Matthew 7 not all people who call on Him will enter Heaven. Romans 1:17-20 talks about those who hold the truth of God in unrighteousness

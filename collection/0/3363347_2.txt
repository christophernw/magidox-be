It could be a fungal infection (nails), but I"m not sure about the teeth. For the toe/finger nails you should see a doctor so that he/she can prescribe an antibiotic.. . For those closed minded people who think it is due to lack of good hygene...this type of fungus can be picked up in gym locker rooms/showers.

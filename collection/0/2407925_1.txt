Evil is knowing something is both bad (unhappy, damaging) and wrong (counter-productive) and choosing to do it anyway because you desire those results.. . Moral evil could refer to something being evil relative to a particular moral code, or you could be using the phrase paradoxically.. . In the latter case, a moral evil is one required by your moral code, and thus good and/or right according to it, but also evil (see above) according to the moral code of others.

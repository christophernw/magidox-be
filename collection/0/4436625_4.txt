You don't. You just remember the red lights. Especially when you're mad. Try tracking red and green lights sometime. Keep a note pad and a pencil in the car. Make a note of each red and each green light. I will bet you that over the course of one week you will do no better than 50-60 percent green no matter what time of day or where you are going or whether you are in a rush or not.

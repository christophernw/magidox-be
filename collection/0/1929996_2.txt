Yes. Blue  suit, white shirt - a tie is about the only thing "flashy" a conservative man can wear. You wouldn't wear a red velvet smoking jacket to work, or a bottle-green frock coat. You can, however, wear a tie with flowers or ducks or wine glasses or T. rex skeletons on it. If you are a banker or a lawyer you should steer clear of hand-painted ties with topless hula girls on them, but if you are a used-car salesman or a rock musician they look just fine.. . Most men whose ties are uncomfortable have gained enough weight that the 16" neck shirts they wore 3 years ago should be traded in on 17" neck ones, but they don't want to admit it. If your shirt fits properly with the top button buttoned, a tie isn't uncomfortable.

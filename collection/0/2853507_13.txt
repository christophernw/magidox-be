Have someone that is really there for you. As for me, thinking of the humiliation if I get to work late makes me get up. Imagining my self looking like a witch because of very little time in preparing makes me get to the bathroom. And thinking that I might not get to ride on time makes me go cram on the way. Everyday is hard to start up specially when your all by yourself.

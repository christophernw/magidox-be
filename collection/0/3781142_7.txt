since i'm up too, i have plenty of ideas! if your head is hurting, a bath will relax you so you can go back to sleep and the steam usually makes your throat and sinuses feel better- drink some cold water while you're in the tub. read something boring while you're in there if you're really impatient to get back to sleep. my dog isn't barking, but i can hear my husband snoring, and i'm in the kitchen!

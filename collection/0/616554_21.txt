ISN'T IT SAD THAT WHEN AN ADULT BREAKS THE LAW, THE CHILDREN GET PUNISHED.. . PERHAPS IF WE ELIMINATE THE LURE OF HAVING A BABY IN THE U.S. AS A WAY OF LEGALIZING THEM, ILLEGALS WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO COME OVER.. . I'M NOT SURE THAT MANY ILLEGALS THOUGHT ABOUT THAT MUCH.  I THINK THEY JUST CAME.  NOW IT HAS BECOME THE 'TUG AT THE HEART' EMOTIONAL ISSUE AND EVERYONE IS GRABBING AT IT.  IN UTAH A FAMILY HAS BEEN SEPARATED.  ALL YOU SEE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEWSPAPER IS THE LEFT-BEHIND-WIFE CRYING.  THE ACCOUNTABILITY THING IS TOUGH.  NOW EVERYONE GETS TO PAY.. . BY THE WAY, IN THE B SECTION OF THE NEWSPAPER THERE IS A SMALL BLURB ABOUT 600 DISABLE PEOPLE IN UTAH WHO WILL LOSE THEIR DISABILITY BECAUSE UTAH IS RUNNING OUT OF MONEY.  WHERE ARE THE TEARS FOR THOSE PEOPLE?

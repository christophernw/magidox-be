It's a combination of female hormone (estrogen) and the extra-special care that women take, in regards to their skin. You don't see (at least *I* haven't) men washing their bodies with loofahs, pumice stones and using a moisturizing soap ... followed by a good moisturizing lotion. We like to feel good for our men.  *sigh* ... the things we do to keep our man happy ...  :)

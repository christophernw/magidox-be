I find the strange thing is that bathroom water tastes different to kitchen water in the same house,  . . tip, . . never drink water from the hot tap.  I've pulled dead birds and mice from the water storage tanks in a roof, and it is known for mucky plumbers to wash their hands or take a pee in the tank.  Happy tea drinking to all who do use the hot water for consumption........................

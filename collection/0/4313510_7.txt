Fruit-bearing plants propagate themselves by having their seeds dispersed. A fruit is often attractive and edible so that somebody will take it away, eat the fruit and disperse the seeds. Even if you swallow the seeds they are usually tough enough to get through your digestive system. The flowers are intended to be attractive to the pollinating insects: if the flowers were consumed instead of pollinated, the seeds would not be formed and the plant would have failed in that regard. Even so, there are many edible varieties of flower, although I would guess they are only a minority.

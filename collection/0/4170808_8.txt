I remember the explanation "Constable on Patrol" being offered as the derivation for the word "cop" but more likely it had to do with the old slang term "copper" Now some sources indicate police were called coppers because the metal in their shields was copper-colored. Others say a copper was someone who copped someone, "copping" meaning "seizing" or "arresting" them.

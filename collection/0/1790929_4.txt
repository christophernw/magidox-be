God gave a law to his people that was at their level. When Christ came, he presented the higher law. It's not that God made a mistake and corrected it. Instead, He provided guideance at the correct level for the people at the time. Kind of like attending first grade and learning to print, and then as you progress, you learn cursive writing instead. Does that mean your First Grade teacher made a mistake? . . What God did actually PROVES He is perfect and knows what He is doing.

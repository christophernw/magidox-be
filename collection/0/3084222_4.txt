The reason they take our money, is so they can supposedly spend it for the benefit of the people which is not always the case. Sure, there are a ton of programs out there, but they're rarely available to single males in their twenties who usually pay the most taxes. (Speaking from personal experience, it just seems that way to me). Technically, you're supposed to have a say on how that money is spent by voting but who knows if that really matters?

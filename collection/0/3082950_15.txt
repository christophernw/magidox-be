breathing is most important.  Pace yourself on a 4 count.  Inhale on every 3 steps, then exhale on the fourth.  Also, Inhale through your nose, exhale through your mouth.  Inhaling through the nose will help regulate the amount of oxygen you are taking in so that you are not sucking wind.. . Good luck!!

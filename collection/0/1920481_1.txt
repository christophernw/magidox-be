one cable, but it depends on your hardware which cable you need. check your plasma cable for a vga connector (3 rows of pin holes, female, one bolt on each side.) If so, you can just get a monitor cable (female to male) and plug it directly in.. . If the TV doesn't have this, but has at least RCA jacks, you can go either s-video to rca (if you have an s-video out) or vga to rca. if you go vga to rca, then yes you will need another cable for sound.

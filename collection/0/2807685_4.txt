Yorkies are really hard to house brake. Kennel training would probably be the best way to train them. Put them in a kennel for most of the day unless if you have them on a leash. Take them out side to go to the bathroom when you first get up, sometime during the day, and just before you go to bed. Give the puppy lots of love and affection, and a small treat after it goes to the bathroom out side. Take them out to go to the bathroom at the same times everyday. Keep to this and soon they will know when and where to go to the bathroom.

Interesting:   So frequently we are willing to make generalizations about everyone else, but acquit our own self.   Lets be fair,  we all often miss reading a serious question,,,and yes, some will avoid responding to such questions as Darfur,,,,and yes. I missed your question about it too,,,just as I also missed the water glass question,,,,but I didnt ever see you responding to any of my questions either.  Were you in denial, or feigning ignorance, or just missed them?    Be careful...that the brush you tar others with doesnt get wiped on self.      Sincerely.

Yes it does but not for the reason you would think.  I lost my fiance in 2002, it was very sudden.  Seeing him like that made me realize how sudden death can hit you.  I went to a grief and loss group but I still worry about death.  I worry that I won't have my parents tomorrow, I worry that something will take my nephews.  What I have learned from death is to value the people I have while I have them.  That I am lucky for what I have.

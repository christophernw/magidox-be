A) They don't;. B) humans thinking generate a kind of 'background thought-static'. When that is going on, it's difficult to perceive spiritual stuff, to have really deep philosophical conversations, and to do metaphysical 'works'. Thus midnight is the 'witching hour'. Count the number of deep conversations you've had in your life, now how many of those started at noon or 3 pm, and how many started at 10 pm and somehow went on until 3 am? You're just not used to the greater sensitivity you have when you're awake at this time, or the number of 'building memories' layered up in the area that you're at.

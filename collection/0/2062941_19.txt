Talk honestly with him, from what you say, he doesn't seem to be to worried about hurting your feelings.   Just tell him that you are not judging him, but that since the two of you have such a huge difference in opinion on this subject, that it would be best to either be completely open with each other with no worries of the other taking it personally, or to avoid the subject altogether.  . . And if he is as steadfast in his resolve to remain a atheist, as you are to remain a christian, I would advise you ahead of time, not to be surprised if your attempt, to bring him into the fold of Christianity, doesn't work.

Gynecomastia in babies and adolescents normally does not require treatment and will usually resolve on its own. If caused by medication or disease, stopping the medication or treating the disease will often cure the gynecomastia. If caused by a lack of testosterone and increase in estrogen, hormonal treatment may be prescribed.

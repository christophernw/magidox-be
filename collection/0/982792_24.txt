Wow, please tell me the secret of how you found out that alllllll those people are Christians.. . Was it by examining their lives in detail to be sure they follow God's Word?. . Did you perhaps read each of their profiles and answers to see what kind of person they are?  ya know, hater or lover, etc.. . Or maybe you work for yahoo and have that kind of puter technology to check that out.. . Either way, cool for you!  But just one problem, err, yer wrong.

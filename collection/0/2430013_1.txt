We toss and turn in our sleep, because our muscles get tired of being in the same position for a very long time.  If we didn't toss and turn in our sleep our you would see sores, and creases made by the sheets and pillow covers all over our body, this would happen because our body is pressed against the bed for so long, and so to prevent any cellular damage we toss and turn in our sleep.

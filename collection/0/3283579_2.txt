I could care less what the Catholic Church thinks. But that does not make the Da Vinci Code any more accurate in its, supposed facts.. . In fact, I am amazed at how gullible people are at believing the so-called "facts" that this book brings up. Out of thin air! 80 gospels written!? And Constantine only chose 4, then corrupted them? First, including all the false gnostic gospels, there was hardly a quarter of that amount. Second, Constantine had nothing to do with the Canon of scripture.. . He states that it was the council of Nicea that voted to say that Jesus was God--and that it was a "close vote". Yeah, a close vote of 316 to 2. Wow, how close. Funny, though, a few months ago they discovered in Megiddo, the oldest Christian church dating back to the 2nd century. 100 years before the council of Nicea did their "close vote", we see a mosaic dedication that reads, "dedicated to the God Jesus Christ". This belief was confirmed by the 2nd century writings of Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Irenius and Clement of Alexandria.. . And then he has the gall to say there were true gospels in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Man, this guy is delusional.There is not ONE mention of Jesus in ANY of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Yet people are eating this nonsense up.. . Mary was Jesus' mother, and He told John, while on the cross, to take her into his home and take care of her. Mary Magdalene was there as well. If they were married, Jesus would have provided for her as well. Do you think after the resurrection that Jesus would have known that Mary M. was pregnant with their child? Yet, when He spoke to her, she called Him "teacher", not "husband", and neither spoke of activity in the womb. A little common sense is needed here.. . If you don't want to believe, then say so. But don't base it on ignorant revisionist history like the Da Vinci Code. Looks like the world is all ready for the coming deception.... . http://us.news1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/uc/20060520/lcrmlu060520.gif. . 2 Thessalonians 2:11-12. For this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.. __________________________. . Alright, show me the evidence. And it's DAN Brown, not Ban Brown. Where is the name of Jesus in the Dead Sea Scrolls if you know so much. I will wait here while you do one little teensy bit of investigation.. ___________________________. . Oh, so now you agree with my dilusional information that Dan Brown got it wrong? My next dilusional piece of information.  Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Irenius and Clement of Alexandria lived and taught BEFORE the Council of Nicea--right or wrong? Come on, you accused me of being dilusional.

Some animals, including cats, have a membrane in the back of their eyes that recovers light that has passed through the retina and reflects it forward onto the retina again.  The purpose of this is to help the animals see very well in the dark (because the stray light gets back to the retina, allowing the retina to collect as much light as possible).  I can't remember what the name of the membrane is, but I'm pretty sure I'm remembering the function accurately.

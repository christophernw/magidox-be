You do not have to talk about the class, that could be boring. Talk about anything you like, the weather, current events, news, homework, the teacher, cloths, music, tv shows. People like to talk about their pets. Just let it flow natural. Sometimes in some situations you just can't get a conversation going. I just naturally act silly however not annoying and hope they are laughing with me and not at me. If they are laughing at me I don't care, I will just laugh at them too.

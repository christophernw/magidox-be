cDNA stands for complimentary strand of DNA made from RNA during reverse-transcription process under the influence of reverse-transcryptase enzyme, usually meant for making of cDNA libraries of genes with expression (there is a major proportion of Genome which has no known expresion or functionless or junk). From conservation point of view, cDNA libraires help to conserve the genetic diversity.

Because there is no money in a cure. Why would any company really want to find a cure for cancer...if you think about it...all Cancer Charities would go out of buisness because there would be no more fundraising...then from the perspective of a Pharmacutical company you have to understand that if they had 1 pill to cure cancer then they would only have one sale...but if you sell many products over a long period of time, just enough to keep someone alive but not fully cured...then you make so much more money. Its sad but true.

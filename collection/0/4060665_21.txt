Because under that religion is the right thing to do...some people do baptize them when they are like 2 weeks old, others wait until they are a lot older...besides everyone has a choice in what to believe, i have known people from this religion that convert to another and get baptized under that religion, so does that baptism at whatever age they do it saves that person???...so your question should be does baptism under any religion save you???...try not to raise a war between religions, I respect everyones beliefs and religion you should too as you would like others to respect yours

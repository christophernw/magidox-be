You just answered my Got Jesus question.  A:  it's not praying in the streets as Pharisees do, it's asking people a valid question.  we are here to continue Christs work, I'm just trying to reach a wider range of people, not bragging about being the best Christian who prays the most and so on.  . . God Bless you

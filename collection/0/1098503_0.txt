It's a sealed room with high barometric pressure.  Sometimes if divers come up too soon, they get a condition called "the bends" in which nitrogen dissolved in the bloodstream starts to come out as bubbles of gas.  (Think of how bubbles come out of soda when you lower the pressure by opening the top.)  So the divers can be put in a hyperbaric chamber, where more of the gas will stay dissolved and the pressure can be lowered gradually.

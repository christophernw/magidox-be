Plenty of sleep (for each person this is different), sleep on your back rather than your stomach (this will help prevent the puffiness and circles from the blood and oxygen flow), and get one of the eye masks that can be heated and cooled (use warm for sinus relief and cool for puffiness).  If you need a more immediate fix, Shiseido has a product line called "White Lucent" which helps to brighten your skin - this is sold at department stores and you can find your nearest retailer at www.shiseido.com (select your language, go to Shiseido USA and it will take you to a page with links about the company).

I think that it is true that we are judged by our appearance and our level of "hottness" but someone who is smart and educated would only strive to find someone of their same academic or intelligence status. It may be true that at first is is sexual but that does not last at the end we strive for people who are like us.  My advice to you is to patient and you will see that there are guys out there that do like girls that are smart and intelligent.

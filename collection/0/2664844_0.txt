I am assuming you want to put the nail in the center of the dowel and the dowel is acting like a cork stopper.. . I would drill a hole in the dowel the same size as the nail and tap very carefully. If you need more holding power, use a little liquid nail in the bottom of the hole (comes in a tube like toothpaste). If you can use a screw, you still need to drill but you will get better holding power.

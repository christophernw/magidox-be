Ringing in the ears is called tinnitis. Some people have it constantly, others only when they have an ear infection or listen to music at high volume without hearing protection. I've had it from both those causes and it drives me mad.. . Usually it goes away when the infection clears up or after the eardrums have had a rest, but you can really mess yourself up if you wear headphones often and play the music too loudly.. . The trick I've found to getting eardrops to go into the ear is to lay down and put the drops in then tug gently on the ear lobe. Sometimes it helps to slightly tilt your head forward too. . . Hope your ringing goes away soon.

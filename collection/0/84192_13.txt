The problem lies in your question's assumption.  A non-graduate's experience and knowledge is NOT greater than that of a college grad.  A college graduate has proven that s/he has the intelligence and discipline to achieve a degree.  And the knowledge of a graduate will often be very subject-intensive and include theoretical aspects, which allow the development of creative new ideas.  A non-graduate can be trained to do anything and become accomplished at it, but the lack of a college degree generally shows that the worker's capacity to learn is more finite than a college grads.. . There are exceptions to everything, of course, but for every one Fortune 500 non-college graduate, the other 499 have degrees.

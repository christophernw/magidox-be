Most schools us this basic 4 point system for gpa.... A = 4. B = 3. C = 2. D = 1. F = 0. . You add all of your grades together, and divide by the number of classes you are taking.  By the way, this means that you should always drop a class if you can instead of failing it.  Even though in most colleges you would still have to pay for the class, a dropped class won't effect you GPA.  An "F," however, is devastating to a GPA.. . You also need to take into account how many credit hours a class is.  (This doesn't matter if you are in High School, or even if every single class is worth the same number of hours.)  For example, in most schools the standard class is 3 credit hours.  But most P.E. classes are only one credit hour, and some advanced classes are 5 credit hours.  In such a case some classes will have a greater effect than others.  In this case the easiest way to think of it is that if you have a 5 hours class and you get an A, you got 5 As.

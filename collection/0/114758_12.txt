Your wrong. God loves you so much He gives you the choice to love Him or not. He could have made us slaves to him, but forced love is not true love, so He gave us a free will. All He wants is for us to love Him. He loved you so much He sacrificed His only son so we could be forgiven of our sins. It is sin that separates us from God, and also sin that gets us a ticket to hell. Therefore, if we chose to sin, then we chose to go to hell. God does not send us to hell, we do!.  Also, sex is a gift from God to husband and wife. We are the ones who make it dirty by fornication and promiscuity. If you don't believe me, think of it this way, sex in a monogamous relationship, ie husband and wife, rarely has bad problems, where as sex with different people over time is an extreme health risk with disease as well as unwanted pregnancy. As you can see, sex out of wedlock is a sin not because God doesn't want you to have fun or feel pleasure, but to keep you from getting Aids or having to get an abortion. Marriage is OK, you can have all the sex and pleasure you want.

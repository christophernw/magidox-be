Scientists try to prove that evolution exists because of geological formations, especially fosils.  But some creationists have countered this argument by saying that if God had the power to create the earth in seven days, He could have created it fosils and all.  They point out that Adam (who had no mother) had a navel (see the Sistine Chapel).  The argument goes that Adam was created with all the mature organs that we know must usually develop from a baby to manhood.. . It is unlikely that scientists and fundmentalists will ever prove their case to the satisfaction of the other.

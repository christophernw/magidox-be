Devastating. You cannot imagine the amount of Nigerians who stow away, enter illegally intocountries all owver the world and bring ill repute to their country. They smuggle drugs intotheir country, smuggle all sorts of merchandise including Ghanian women and it is too bad for the Nigerian economy and Nigerian pride.

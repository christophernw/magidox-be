It's a law because the government's job is to protect us, even sometimes from ourselves.  Sure, it's a free country, but that's why there's a speed limit, too.  People will do 120 mph and cause devistating, fatal crashes if it's not policed.  It's the same thing.  Auto safety must be enforced, much as I sometimes dislike wearing a seatbelt.. . The best way is to just ignore the problem.  Put your seatbelt on and don't worry about it.  It's really not THAT important on the grand scale of things, is it?  It may seem overbearing, but the best way is to not worry about it.. . And yes, it is your life.  Unlike the fatal crashes where they're also worried about other people's lives, this is just you.  But there's a parallel.   They're saving your life when they police the meat industry for health-code violations.  They may be cutting off your ability to buy the meat, but aren't you a damn sight happier?  No need to complain.  It's just a law, man.

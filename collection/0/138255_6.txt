Well I guess you've never seen engines where they had idiots driving them.... and never or barely changed the oil..... the oil gets thicker and thicker, picks up more and more wear particals and dirt and gas from some blowby....... and after a while starts to clump up and turns the engine into a sludge cake..... basically becomes a valve grinding like compound...... may or may not blow the engine up  but might just seize up.

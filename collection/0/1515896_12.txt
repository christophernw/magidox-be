its disgusting.  But its a very complex social problem.  I mean some poeple accually like it.  I tend to think it is very unatractive.  Thats the difference.   BUT  I think people should be able to do with their bodies what they want...  Its just like the issue of religion.  I like the fact that anyone can be whatever religion they want, becuase I am an athiest and I want the freedom to be that too. so I tolirate the others veiws..  yes smoking sucks..  but I like to smoke pot and drink, so what can I really say.

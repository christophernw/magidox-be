I see where your coming from, since Argonians are lizards and are therefore not milk bearing, and it is awful odd that they have breasts. However, I think for ease of familiarity, and because they are anthropromorphic characters based off of humans, it becomes a simple device for the animators to show which Argonians are female, and which are male. . . And....its just a video game. :-)

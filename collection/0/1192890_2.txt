Your photoreptors and your visual cortex cells randomly fire, it is background noise a bit like you get with a CCD camera. Also you may notice that if you put pressure on your eyeball (not too much!) you will see a bright spot - so photoreceptors respond to more that just light.. . I get this too and my vision is fine.

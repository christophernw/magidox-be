To Jordan it is luckily amazingly cheap to call. I suggest getting a calling card, none in particular that I can suggest, sorry, but anyone will do the trick.. . Dial the 800 number on the card and follow the instructions from there. Also, ask whoever it is from Jordan if they can call you, since my relatives call us sometimes thrice daily with little to no charges for them.

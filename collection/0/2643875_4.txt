I think this is because, in our daily lives, excepting Hermit The Frog. we come into contact with many different people who we have to trust to a certain degree, otherwise we would get nowhere. i.e. when you go to Mc Donalds, who cooks your food, when you use a toilet in mall, who cleans the toilet and what with.. When we fly on a plane we trust the pilot. Strangers all of them, but we must trust ;otherwise we can just go and  live in a carton.

Declining?  Compared to what?  These things have ALWAYS been around.  It's just that during ancient times, they didn't have CNN to tell people on the other side of the world what was going on.  And, just what do you mean by "traditional family" according to who's culture?  It's not the bibles.  Definitely not from the Old Testament either, polygamy and adultery and porn (Song of Solomon) is ALL over the place in there.  Please don't try to convince us that it was pure back then.  It has never been pure.  The only difference is how big society has gotten and we have technology to transfer this information as soon as it happens.  Back then, you may not hear about something till the following year.

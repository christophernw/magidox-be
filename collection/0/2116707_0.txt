well your opinion on islam or christanity is not so good and not so right as well you based your question on few stories which are not right i believe hell is present but neither me nor any body can deciede who goes to hell and who don`t both islam and christanity is a peacefull religion which respect others wright to believe in what he wants jesus said be kind to those who hates you and quran ( muslims holy book ) says there is no obligation in believe, what you saif about prophet mohamed that he married a 6 years old girl is not true refer to an islamic text book  to know the true , prophet mohamed is human being he had sex and that`s is not shamful, jesus is the word of god he send it to the earth to set peace . we must respect each other and we must respect our believings

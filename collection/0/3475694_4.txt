That's a very difficult question, and to me, it seems like it should be reversed.  Kant struggles with this very question.  Can the functioning of our minds take place without sensory experience?  He categorizes knowledge into two categories.  The first, a priori-- are thought processes that occur without the impetus of sensory experience.  This a-priori knowledge can be broken down into two further categories, pure and impure.  Pure a-priori knowledge and reasoning would be that which exists and begins independent of sensory knowledge.  Impure a -priori reasoning occurs mostly without/ but may have a small root based in sensory experience.. . The other category is a-(shoot I don't remember the latin) but is knowledge and reasoning that is gained and started through sensory experience.. . Now, to really be able to give you a good answer, we would need to know what discipline you are considering here.  Are you considering a philosophical question for a philosophy class?  Are you considering this from an evolutionary perspective for a science class?  Could you give us more context to your question by adding details?

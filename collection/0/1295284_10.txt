You are always your own primary care giver.  However nobody knows everything (not even a megalomaniac).  . . Use experts but don't rely on them.  What I mean by that is get information from experts but filter it through your own knowledge and experience.  . . Use the information but don't trust blindly.  Experts are people; some will help, some are in it for themselves and some will make mistakes.  . . Asking good questions, questioning the answers and then deciding for yourself is the best formula.

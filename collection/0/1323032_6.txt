Phone the officer who has the warrant taken out and tell him you would like to speak with him.. Do not get annoyed or shout as this will be seen as aggression, explain your case.. This sort of thing is usually treated as a domestic and rarely goes very far, unless your brother is a d**khead and wants to ruin your life

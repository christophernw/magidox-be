Well Melancholy Girl after just finishing a delicious Butterfinger candy bar,  I thought a question about having butter fingers or something like that would be appropriate, and low and behold you asked one similar. To be honest, have no clue. Could be something to do with having 'butter fingers' where things slip out of your grasp.....but what does that have to do with a chocolate bar, anyway....it tasted plenty good.

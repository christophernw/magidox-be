Buy a SuperScratcher pad... I got mine at Wal-Mart... The SuperScratcher is a rectangular box no thicker than an average telephone book and is inexpensive: it provides an alternate "scratching" outlet for cats who often choose sofas, chairs, curtains and other inappropriate household surfaces to indulge their natural need to scratch.. It draws their attention by catnipwhich is already in the box.. . The SuperScratcher saved my furniture and curtains, and my cat loves the box so much I often even find him curled up asleep on top of it.. . I also occasionally trim my cats claws... but it's not very easy to do and you can't trim them too short. Once I trim them he just goes right to his scratcher to sharpen them back up though.

Let me take the analogy of "changing people's minds" - 200 years ago, people though it was ok to enslave other human beings - in fact, they weren't even considered to have "rights" like court -  It's a good thing that Abolitionists worked hard to "change people's minds" and try to bring equality to the enslaved people.. . For pro lifers, abortion is murder - so if you believed someone was being murdered, wouldn't you try to stop it?  One of the rationale that they use is that if a pregnant woman saw the fetus within her, and knew exactly how an abortion worked, she would not be able to complete that act.. . Others feel that a fetus is just "tissue", which can be harvested for stem cells, and that the "human" doesn't appear until natural birth.  . . I have feelings on both sides - I don't feel I have the moral right to choose for anyone, but I think that more information is always better than less, as it's a decision that many end up regretting in the long run, and is irreversible.

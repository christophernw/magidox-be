Well i was having the problem too with my 8 week old lab. even though we took him outside he was going in the house. another dog also does the same as your dog is doing now and she is very old. the way to do it is every time the dog goes on the floor spank them and stick their nose in it and then put them outside. if the dog is just holding it and coming in from outside and going on the floor then you just need to leave it outside. eventually it will go outside because its not going to hold it forever. frequently take it outside. it will eventually learn, but if not i would consider getting rid of it. dogs are fun and really nice animals to have, but not if you have to deal with them taking over your house and destroying it.

Support of a state for Jews to live in. Often mistaken when compared to 'semitism';. . Hence you can be 'pro-Judaism' but 'anti-zionistic' (for Judaism but against the creating of a state for them to live in, 'anti-semitic' but 'pro-zion' (anti-Jewish (obviously) but you'd rather see them all gathered in one place.). . I'm in the camp of 'live and let live'

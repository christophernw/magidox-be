very well said man!. i trust you are an American and im glad that you see that western Europe is ahead of you guys for once. here in England we didnt realy have much of a problem when they put the gay marriage thing to vote and we seem to be more accepted every day, but from what i can see of some American attitudes it must be terrible at times.. I wish all the world would just be free to do as they please and people just smile and walk on by

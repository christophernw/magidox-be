I am not Dominican or Mexican, but here is my best guess: In general Mexicans are at a lower socioeconomic status than Dominicans. Since the average Caucasian American can't tell the difference between Dominicans and Mexicans (like the way some people say all Asians look alike), Dominicans are often mistaken for Mexicans, and feel that they are treated with less respect because people assume they are Mexican and poor.. . P.S. Not my belief, I believe people should be treated as INDIVIDUALS, not as Dominican, Mexican, Asian, Caucasian, rich or poor, but this is our society...

Early morning, it was misty and it was good for the plants. By 10am, it started to be in the 80's yet it was breezy.. It's 6:50pm now in (Southern California) and it's nice to have an evening walk; breezy and cooler too:-).. . Hope you're having a lovely evening as well, no heavy rains to keep you on a Friday night party:-).

call the district superintendant's office. They are responsible for administering all the schools in the district. If that isn't the proper place, they should be able to direct you to it. . . If that doesn't work and you've tried face-to-face conferences with the administrators in question, you could have to change schools, sue, or accept that maybe your little angle is lying to you about what's going on.

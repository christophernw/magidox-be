As per Naadi shastra every individual's life is already pre-destined and documented in a bank of information written in leaves and preserved over centuries. These documents are still available, and there are experts who own these. They can look up based on your name or date of birth and if they get the leaf with the exact match, they can predict the future events in once lives.

You don't HAVE to be.. . . . Many choose to be out of fear, for lack of a proper word.. . . Maybe Brainwashing is better.. . . People are taught in school that they're supposed to be with one person.. Many religions teach this, using the act, will, and wrath of god as "justification" (When it isn't). Many parents teach this.. . Laws and Governments support this.. . . . I, however, don't really care.. . . Spread the love. :)

Sounds like apnoea, my husband had the same thing, it was caused through snoring.   Because his soft pallet muscles became tired they would collapse causing him to stop breathing.  This would partially wake him up so he didn't actually get a good nights sleep hence he was tired through the day.  . . There are several treatments for this my husbands was the most extreme he had to have his soft pallet removed but not everyone needs to have this done.  . . What you need to do is see your doctor as this can lead to heart attacks and other serious illnesses.

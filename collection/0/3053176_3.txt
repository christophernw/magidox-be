Wow, Your entire premise is based upon a left-wing blog quoting another left-wing blog on a flawed conclusion drawn by a left-wing reporter on a left-wing news network.. . Get out of the echo chamber. . . A. The war is NOT being lost. B. Not blaming Rumsfeld is NOT blaming the military. C  The administration has made it quite clear that thay are listening to the Generals. The Generals have made it quite clear that this is indeed happening.. . If you desire to sound informed, at least do your own homework. If you parrot an idiot, it is difficult to not sound like an idiot yourself....

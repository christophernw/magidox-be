For "cods" hake, Im "floundering," on an answer to "fish"(this) question. I'll make no "bones" about it although some might "skate" over the issue my "shell" I won't "clam" up.. Before anyone else "mussels" in I think it's down  to the fact that the "seaweed," in the water. How "shellfish" can it get! Hows "sprat" for an answer?  I'll "wave" cheerio for now. I'm sure "eel" meet again over the "net"

AH, people are amazing........... . Before water boils, it must be at 100 degrees. For each gram of water, you must add a calorie of heat to raise the temp of that gram 1 degree. When the water gets to 100 degrees, you must then add xxx calories to turn the water into steam. This is called heat of vaporization. Thus it is impossible for cold water to boil faster than warm water.. . On the other end, to freeze water, you must first lower the temp by taking out 1 calorie per gram per degree until your water is at 0 degrees, then you must remove the heat of fusion to turn it into ice. The only concievable way for warm water to freeze faster than cold water is for the warm water to turn enough of the warm water to steam, which requires the the heat of vaporization. Since the heat of vaporisation must come from somewhere, it would be heat removed from the remaining water, which would cool it.

if you are in a good relationship you are in good spirits so it will improve your health. if you are in a bad one it stresses you out which stress can make you sick. i was married to a man who was verbally abusive and i was extremely unhappy. i got sick easier i lost A LOT of weight and was way underweight and i looked anorexic (even though i was eating) i looked tired all of the time and my eyes almost looked glazed over. i had no clue how much of an effect it had on me physically until after i left him and i looked back at pictures taken of me during that time. i was 5'1" and under 90 pounds when i finally left him. i've gained back much of the weight i lost and i'm rarely sick. when people see me they always say 'wow you look so much better since you left him!' your state of mind in general affects your over all health

I'm really interested in mountain climbing, and to me, this book is very exciting.  It tells in detail everything that happened on the trip, and vividly explains the '96 Everest disaster.  I've read a couple books on the same topic, but Into Thin Air is probably my favorite.  It's pretty well written, and easy to read.

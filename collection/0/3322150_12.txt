I think that the right way to do it would be to see what are your spiritual needs, see if the religion that you are interested in is doing what God says we should do like keep his commandments and spend time with him. Make sure that you have studied about religions that way you can make sure that you have seen every possibilities of religions. Ans choose the one that is right for you. Another smart way to do it is to simply ask God to demonstrate to you what is the right religion for you. And I'm sure that he will show you. . . May God help you on your journey finding Him.

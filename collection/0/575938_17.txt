First of all: not all of us who are under 18 are dimwitted.. Second: IQ´s measure your intelligence, and philosophy is not only about intelligence, it´s also about talent and the innate ability to wonder.. Third: your question really does not contribute to the solution of such problem.. Fourth: because people are scared. Surprise someone, change a situation, ask a smart question, or just be your own complicated self, which does not fit into general standards, you scare them, because all their lives they tried to be like everyone else, and suddenly you tell them:¨It´s OK to think for a change, to ask questions no one can answer, to be complicated.¨. Fifth: agreed, most questions are really... let us not go there, but isn´t a true philosopher supposed to see even in that a great wisdom, preferably one which does not state that the world is losing more and more brain cells every day?

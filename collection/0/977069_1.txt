You can't, California changed the law on domestic violence in 1991 I believe.  They made is a felony, and they made it easier for an officer to make the charges without a complaint by a victim.  I was an officer at the time; and the rule was if you saw an evidence of the violence ( a bruse, a cut, scratch what ever ) you could charge the other person with domestic violence and the victim wouldn't have to do or say anything.  As such the victim can't drop the charge - its not made by them - its made by the arresting officer.

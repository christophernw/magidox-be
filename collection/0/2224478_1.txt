Me, I personally don't believe in God because I have enough belief in myself. I have enough confidence in my abilities as a being rather than worship someone that's not proven to exist. Why worship someone who's not there, who's just a word and a myth? I know that I'm real, and I know I can do things on my own or with the help of someone I know is real, friends and family.. . Basically, I believe what I see. No harm in that, is there? . . Don't hate anyone based on their opinions now, it's not nice. Not saying you do, but just a heads up.

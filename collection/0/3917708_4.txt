My second grade teacher Mrs. Arnold. She had a problem, because I remember seeing her popping pills in the back part of the classroom, and she would just be really mean and ugly to all the kids. . . We were learning how to write in cursive and I wrote a letter wrong and instead of me erasing it, I wrote over it. She got all angry and poked me really hard in my chest and yelled saying I couldn't do that. She poked me so hard in my chest with her finger I had a bruise.  I cried and told my momma. Now you know a black momma going up to a school to talk to a teacher because the teacher bruised her child is not pretty. .  That teacher was such a beyoch.

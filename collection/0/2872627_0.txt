Because her hormones are going insane, she's constantly hungry or tired or sick or any combination of the three probably has a small child using her bladder like it's a trampoline, which makes her have to pee all the time including during the night which makes her more tired during the day. On top of that, if she's showing, she probably has complete strangers coming up to her wanting to touch her belly and all kinds of people offering her all kinds of unwanted parenting advice and/or telling her what she should name your child- not normal names either- names like Poindexter or Brunhilda (no offense to anyone who actually has those names.) It all tends to get pretty annoying after awhile.

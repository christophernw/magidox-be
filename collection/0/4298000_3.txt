I haven't seen the stats, but both the American Red Cross and the World Health Organization have to be up there.  Nonprofit?  In that league, it's not a black and white term. I believe that the mega-nonprofits do good, because a lot of money does go to people who need it.  But I also know that they have a lot of very well paid executives who are on salaries that are pretty competitive with the for-profit sector, so someone DOES profit from their activities.

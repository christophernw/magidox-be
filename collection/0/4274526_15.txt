Why  do you assume that the majority of the legal immigrants entered illegally in the first place??  On the contrary, the vast majority of the legal immigrants have been legal from the beginning ... going through paperwork, getting their approval, and entering legally ... whether or not they married later is another matter ... . . If you refer to "way back when", all I can say is that the immigration laws were different then ... the country actually advertised for immigrants, did you know that?  And they had to go through whatever screening they had then at Ellis Island etc., consequently following the laws of the day ...  I don't know about you, but I never heard of invasions of people over the Canadian and/or Mexican border in days gone past ... so  cop yourself on!  ILLEGAL means breaking the LAW!  The EXISTING law, the law of TODAY .....

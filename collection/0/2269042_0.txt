We support Israel only because we need a friend in the Middle East.  That's the only reason why Israel was formed in the first place.  Harry Truman, after WWII, supported the creation of Israel because he and his cabinet figured if there was a nation in the Middle East that they could be friends with, then the US would have support if they ever went to war in that area of the world.

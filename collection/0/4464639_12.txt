Here is a GREAT recipe that doesn't require marinating, but is full of flavor.  It is very rich and delicious, and is best served with rice pilaf and steamed garlic broccoli.. . 4 whole chicken breasts, halved. Salt & freshly ground black pepper. 5 tbsp. unsalted butter. 1/2 c. cognac. 3 tbsp. unbleached all-purpose flour. 2 tsp. dried tarragon. 3 1/2 c. non vintage champagne. 1/2 c. heavy or whipping cream. . Sprinkle the chicken breast with salt and pepper. Melt the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven over medium high heat. Brown the chicken breasts, a few at a time, on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside.. . Pour cognac into the pan, warm it and flame with a match. When the flames subside, stir in the flour and tarragon. Cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in 3 cups of champagne. Return the chicken to the pan. Cover and simmer until the chicken is tender, about 45 minutes. Remove the chicken to a warmed serving platter. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup of champagne and the cream. Cook the sauce over high heat until reduced and slightly thickened. Pour the sauce over the chicken and serve immediately. Serves 6.. . EDIT-CIty Girl is full of bologna.  You don't need some fancy spice needle to have flavorful chicken.  Use vinegars, broth, or wines along with plenty of spices.  Try cutting your chicken into smaller pieces, particularly with breasts.  I usually fillet them because they are so incredibly thick.  The thinner they are, the quicker and better they absorb the flavor!!

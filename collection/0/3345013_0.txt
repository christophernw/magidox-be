I never heard of the pad that wiseman suggested, but if so, get one. We trained our dog this way, she was a very smart one and knew exactly what we wanted, You must have patience and take the dog back to where you want it to go on the leash until it learns then take the leash off and tell it back or behind the tree mor the words you use when it goes. don't forget the praise every time it goes, and keep that area clean, dogs don't like to step in their own crap either and especially after it rains. keep up the praise and the older the dog gets, it will be fine. never hit the dog because it will become confused and be unsure of what to do. So have patience.  Good Luck!

It used to be that children were taught the meaning of Halloween, and the children generally stayed in their own neighborhoods.. But even then, my parents had me watch as they checked everything we got, so we both learned some of the important values of social intercourse.. Trust no one, Harm no one.. Keep in mind that most child molestations, and kidnappings, etc, etc,,, are by people that the child knows.. So teaching a child to avoid strangers doesnt really make them that much safer, It is much smarter to teach them what to do if ANYONE, makes them feel uncomfortable.

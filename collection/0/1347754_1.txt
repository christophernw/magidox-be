Ummmm... okay.. . The price of gas is not 'controlled' by consumers. It is true, however, that demand drives the price of oil (and hence gas), but this is true of the economy in general. Obvious factors in the price of gas relate to our current crappy situation with the war-waged-on-a-lie-in-Iraq. Other considerations include the expansion and economic development in China, Americans driving more (think: suburban sprawl), and whether the crude oil market as a whole tightens or lowers inventories of oil. If the refineries get outpaced in the demand versus capacity, this can also drive up prices.

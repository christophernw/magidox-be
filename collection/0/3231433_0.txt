If the bra is brand new, you shouldn't have to tighten too much. Bras tend to get stretchy when they get older, and you may have to tighten it periodically. Just see how it looks under a plain fitted Tshirt. You'll know if it's too saggy. Also, if your breasts are spilling out of the cups, you've probably tightened it too much.

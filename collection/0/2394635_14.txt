i have two schnauzers that act the same way.. if my hand is near their face they will lick it.  if i had recently been eating food with my hands, sometimes they wont stop.  if its constantly licking your hand and you for some reason dont like that, then wash your hands, should minimize the licking.  they tend to slow down on my hands after they get all of whatever it is they're licking.  they'll also lick my feet if my feet.

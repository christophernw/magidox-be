In all reality, the exception lie in instances of college grads earning more. At 23, a High School graduate with IQ 120 will likely be earning more than a College grad with IQ 120. The biggest difference is that the high school grad has proven his worth to his current employer. If he goes elsewhere, it will likely be for a pay cut. The college grad will likely change jobs a handful of times after graduation, because it is assumed by employers that they possess basic skills without proof. The college grad can usually make more money somewhere else, even if they are less than adequate. The truth of the matter lies in those employees that are IQ 135+. A high school grad will excel at their job and occasionally fix inefficiencies. A college grad at that IQ level often has recieved specific general training that does focus on modifying current processes, but building new ones. Don't believe what you see on TV, where college grads are making so much more than everyone else. Several of my friends that got Bs in college are accepting manufacturing and secretarial jobs to pay the bills. As soon as something better pops up though, they're gone. Opportunities just don't pop up as often for HS grads. Don't go out to get your degree if you're past the age of 27 or so. Go out and take specific night classes in computer programs you use at work or could use at work. Go learn Excel inside and out. Write a small database for your work in Microsoft Access. Learn how to use Microsoft Project. They're hard to learn in a classroom. Chances are, you can outperform a graduate in these areas by learning them while you are applying them. You don't have to be a computer genius for these either. Have good math, logic, and presentation skills and you can move up to mid-management. Many companies limit your vertical mobility to your education though. Just how high do you want to go?

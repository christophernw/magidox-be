It may be the simple fact that people nowadays expect the world in "service" and have the option to tip or not to tip or even tip appropriately. I work in the service industry also...and it seems lately customers tip based on how they "feel", your service can be "great" or bad, they pay "how they feel". Now traditionally, you were tipped 15% as a bottom but it usually increased by the party size. Society is struggling as a whole in alot of areas financially, and unfortunately, dinning out and bar clubbing is an expense that is very optional to do or not to do. I suggest that you take your skills to a higher end crowd and get those better tips, Good Luck:)

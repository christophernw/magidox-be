cut down on the disctractions. cut off your cellphone and don't open your messenger.. also, rotate your homework so you do one boring subject followed by one fun subject. and have an accountability partner. say, you'll meet your friend at starbucks when you get your homework done, and when you get there, have her ask you if it's done.

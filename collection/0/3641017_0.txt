It's def. is simple. The unlawful ending of another person's life.. . There is a difference between killing and murder...both legally and ethicly.  . To shoot someone in cold blood = murder/homicide.. To shoot a person breaking in your home and threatening your children = killing. Thats for a grand jury to figure out.  The police will / should still investigate all deaths equally.

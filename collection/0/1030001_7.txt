Because it is inherent in man's egotistical nature and his shameless impudence to INSIST in BEING ALWAYS RIGHT and that the other person [anyone not agreeing with him or his religion] is ALWAYS WRONG -- regardless of what the subject matter is! This may be his only means to shield his/her ignorance and/or to hide their fear of the unknown from being exposed.. . In other words, for them, 'the best defense is offense.' Meaning, in their puny little minds they prefer to strike the first blow of hatred at you before you can get a word in edgewise.. . Religion has become such an emotionally charged topic that, for the most part, it hits a raw nerve in one's innermost core of spirituality --especially when it is "shaken and not stirred..." LOL.. . Peace be with you!

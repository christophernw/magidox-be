You fill the three gallon jug all the way, you pour all the water in the five gallon jug, you fill the three gallon jug again.  You pour as much as you can in the five gallon jug, so there's 5 gallons in the 5 gallon jug and only 1 gallon in the three gallon jug.  You empty the 5 gallon.  You pour the rest of the three gallon in the 5 gallon jug, so there's 1 gallon in the 5 gallon jug.  Fill the three gallon all the way and put three gallons in the five gallon jug.   KA-BOOM!  4 gallons in the 5 gallon jug!!!. . TA-DA

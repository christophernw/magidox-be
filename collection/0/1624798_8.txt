Apart from George Bush, European law and policy reigns king as far as Britain is concerned.. . We're slowly giving away the control of Britain to a bunch of rich men that have bought a seat in Brussels.. . The idea is to create a United States of Europe and remove British soveriegnity for good.. . Makes you wonder why so many people died in WW2, when you see Blair just give control of our nation away.

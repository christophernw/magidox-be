"Death" isnt anything God wanted for us, WE brought death on ourselves. We all listen to Satan, we all die and thats that. I lost my best friend when we were 17 also to an overdose. And I know its a horrible thing to get through but maybe you would like to email me your answer to this: What would we ever learn about putting ourselves in danger if only old people died?

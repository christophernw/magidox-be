I looked at the answers you have so far received. READ this one, it is the CORRECT ANSWER! Asking age,religion,sex and especially Race,are Illegal Questions on an Application  Form. If this is a medical, that also is unnecessary. By the year 2010, over 97% of the WORLD will be of colour. There is no longer a bi-racial,tri-racial it is now multiracial and with the explosion of the DNA factors - we should all know by now, that on the Inside, we are ALL the SAME, well almost everything, not our personalities,genetic diseases,etc. But you know what I mean. Tell your friend, any company that is still practising that Illegal Law, should be reported and to definitely NOT work for them. Good Luck...

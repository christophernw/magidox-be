Bell's Palsy is a result of damage to the facial nerve(s) caused, it is widely believed, by a herpes infection.  Herpes in any form, and this includes shingles, genital herpes, and even the herpes that causes cold sores, is not (currently) curable; it can only be suppressed by medications.  Also, damage to nerves (as occurs in Bell's) is often permanent since nerve tissue usually does not regenerate on its own.

What Christ said about that mountain was not that it was conditional on if you believed enough, but that if you had faith the size of a mustard seed, the mountain would obey your command to move... and that's what I've been thinking the whole time I've been reading these answers... surely if you can move a mountain with a tiny bit of faith (aka belief), you should be able to regrow a limb. Excellent question.

Well your cat could be doing this for one of four reasons #1 It could be teething. #2 It could be doing this to clean it's teeth. #3 It may think this is a fun game/toy. Or #4 It could be it is taking the pieces of the boxes to make a nest of sorts. Either for sleeping with, or for birthing on. I would say that unless it is chewing it into pieces small enough for it to choke on, don't worry it can't harm you cat.

Islam is not the problem. It's humans that are the problem and religion in general. There is good and bad in everything and there is right and wrong in everything. Everyone takes an action for a reason, based on a number of factors which could include, up bringing, influence, judgement, experience, pain, joy, etc...etc. One must never judge religion or use it in the wrong way.

Let your COUNT rise.. #2 - Slow down, stroke too fast and you'll just boil over. #3 - Bring yourself to the edge of climax and then stop.        Do this several times until you can't hold back.. #4 - NOT FOR THE TIMID - Pressure on the prostate.. #5 - Let your friend do it for you!. . now stroke it to the east and stroke it to the west....

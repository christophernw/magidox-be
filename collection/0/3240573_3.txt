If she still won't care for them after she has the rest of her kittens, contact a vet.   Kitty may not know how to take care of them, hopefully she will learn.  In the mean time try gently washing the newborns with a warm damp rag, and try to keep them warm.  Also try putting the babies up to her, their instinct will tell them what to do.

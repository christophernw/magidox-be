I think you better follow your orders. When you are in a war you have to remember that you have a job to do no matter what it is, and to fight for you country. Those one or two "insurgents" as you say are obvisouly important if they give you the order to do so.... . . Did they think it was unethical when they flew 747's into the Twin Towers, Pentagon, and in the field in Penn..... They didnt care about our innocent civilians when they did that..... . Its war, you do what you have to do and put it behind you...

Not all black girls are loud so you shouldn't tar all of them with the same brush. I am a white guy and I find most black girls are fun loving and always seem to be happy and laughing. Nothing wrong with that. I am not a racist so regardless of their colour I say good luck to them, let them enjoy life as after all we are not long on this earth. Come on girls be loud!

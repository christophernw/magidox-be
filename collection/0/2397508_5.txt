It's a good question.. The teflon coating you get on pans only gets it's non stick characterists once it has been baked on to the pan.. The product comes as a powder or fluid which is sprayed onto the pan and then baked on.. Because it does not have the non stick properties untill baked it forms good van der vaals forces (intra-molecular attraction) with the pan, hence it stick to the pan, and not your eggs.

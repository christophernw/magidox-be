Well, when you calculate your grade point average. In the Florida Orange County School System, an "A" is 4 points, a "B" is 3, a "C' is 2, and a "D" is 1. You add these numbers according to your grade in each class and divide by the number of classes. Many schools, however, use a "weighted" system which allows for a higher average. For example, an "A" in a regular class would give you a 4, but an "A" in an honors class would give you a 5. If you take six honors classes and get straight         . "A's" then you will end up with a 5.0 GPA. As for AP classes, an "A" will give you a 6. That is the highest you can get for an "A" in high school. For college, I cannot be sure as I am not there yet. I hope this is clear and helpful.

for 3-d object surface area, add up surface area of all sides.  some helpful formulas for surface area:. 2-D:.  - triangle: (1/2)*(base)*(height).  - circle: (about 3.14 - also called pi)*(radius)^2.  - sector of circle: (1/2)*(radius^2)*(sector angle). 3-D:.  - sphere: 4*(pi)*(radius)^2.  - Cylinder: 2*(area of circle)+[2*(pi)*(radius)*(cylinder height)].  - cone: (pi)*(base radius)*(square root of:[raduis^2 + height^2]). . as a fun thought, you may also use the integration of an algebraic function to find 3-D surface areas (learn in Calculus)

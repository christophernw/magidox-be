A legally binding contract is one that carries legal penalties should one or the other party forfeit.. . If the seller signed the contract, then he is legally bound to honor the contract.  However you might want to consider the value of keeping a good relationship with this guy and writing a new contract.  As the guy above me mentions, it all depends on the judge -- some judges might toss out the suit simply because it's stupid to make a big deal over an error in addition.

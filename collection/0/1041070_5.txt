All I think you can say is that wealthism has got off lightly so far.. . . The huge anti-poverty campaigns of last summer, focussed by Bob Geldof as Make Poverty History suggests that there are a lot of people think a decent standard of living, healthcare, clean water, housing etc ... should be the right of everyone in the world.. . So wealthists are in a minority, I would say.. . If you despise those who are poor, you will tend to be despising black people, disabled people and other oppressed groups, as there is a correlation between ethnicity and poverty, disability and poverty etc

At least 9 of the service men killed in Iraq were Jewish. The number is almost certainly higher, but the Defense Dept no longer keeps stats on the religion of its personnel, and chaplain will not confirm or deny a victim's religion. In Iraq, servicemen of most faiths might be wise to not disclose their religions.

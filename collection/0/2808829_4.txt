Without loosing muscle, I assume you workout. We are what we eat. Just eat leaner, like a grilled chicken breast and something green with it. If you eat like this, you may eat 4 or 5 times a day. No sugars and sodas etc. Eat lots of fruits and veggies but some protien from meat will keep your muscle.

If you are honestly looking for "scientific proof", I'm afraid that you have stepped on a rhetorical landmine.  You have had the misfortune of asking one of the many questions the Creationists ask several times a week, usually in with a bunch of other questions, for none of which they want answers.  The answer is simple.  Apes and humans descended from a proto-ape.  Most of the branches that descended from this ancient creature have come to an end, and even now, several great ape species are endangered.. . Your "only one right answer" statement set off a lot of alarm bells that suggested you were not interested in an answer, even if it was countered by your statement that your answer could be wrong.  Presupposing the answer is not very scientific.  Also, "scientific proof" triggers alarm bells.  Science has evidence, demonstrated hypotheses, and disproof, but no absolute proofs of anything.  The theory of gravity has less evidence, but then again, physics is simpler than biology.  I hope you understand that your question sounded a lot like the Creationist "Evolution is stupid because if we evolved from apes..." questions that fly around here several times a week.

So broad, so subjective ... Creativity is the act of creation, to make something new from nothing. And since we aren't god (otherwise there might be way too many universes peopled with "The Simpsons" characters), we must be satisfied with art, children, and technology. But we can't be creative unless we're provided an environment that appreciates and encourages it. Under No Child Left Behind, the only, and I mean ONLY, creative outlet for children was a computer.

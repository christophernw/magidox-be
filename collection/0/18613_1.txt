negative ions are formed by the addition of an electron to the orbit of any atom.when an electron is added,the efeective nuclear charge of the nucleas decreases and so its nuclear charge so the electrons now try to be far from the nuleus and the radius is hence larger.in contrast a cation is very small than an its atom.

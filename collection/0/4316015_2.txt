Make sure you get enough calcium and vitamin D together.  The vitamin D helps your body absorb the calcium better.  Good sources are milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, canned salmon with the bones (just make sure to mash it good), figs, soy milk.  A dietician can give you a full list.  Vitamin D is formed in our bodies when we are exposed to the sun.  It's also added to milk.  Certain exercises can help also.  Walking is a very good one.

Why indeed?  Is it because they are lazy and stupid?  . Probably not... . It's probably just because they have not been exposed to many foreign languages.  However, many people (at my school) can respect the languages of French and Spanish; this is probably because of similarities and of the closeness of these languages (Mexico to the south, Canada to the north).. However, they don't deal so well with Asian languages, as I've found;  I've tried Japanese on them, and it doesn't stick...  Although they show some enthusiasm in trying to ask me how to say this and that in Chinese (my primary language), I don't think that they are really interested.. The differences between the Asian languages and the European languages are just too big for most Americans to accept.. Hope this helps (though it probably just confuses you more)

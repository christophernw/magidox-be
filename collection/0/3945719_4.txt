One is printed and legal in Canada.  The other is printed and legal in the US.. . I am assuming you want to know about using one country's money in the other country.. . Most merchants along the us/canada border (such as in Michigan where I am) will accept Canadian money, but usually at a discout of around 15%.  (Though most will except Canadian coins at face value.  Kind of hard to discount a penny).. . In Canada, many merchants will accept US currency at around 15% over face value.  (Meaning a US dollar buys about $1.15 worth of merchandise).. . You can also go to any bank and exchange one currency for the other.  As the difference in value between the two changes almost daily, you can sometimes get a bargain by getting the currency in advance.  (You may be able to get a 20% discount on the Canadian, or only pay 10% over value on the US).. . Hope that helps.

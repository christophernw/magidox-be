Get more vitamins into your system, preferably by eating more fresh fruit and vegetables rather than taking vitamin tablets.  Drink more water (about 8 glasses a day) as this strengthens just about everything in your body, and also keeps you hydrated.  Spend more time outdoors; this will get your body used to all the 'elements' including pollution and cold weather.  . . Breathing in fresh air 'cleans' your lungs, sea air (if you live on the coast) is also excellent for this.  Take a cod-liver oil tablet each day; these are helpful in producing red blood cells for healthy blood.  It might also help if you become a blood donor.  You can only do this about three times a year, but it means that a pint of 'old' blood is taken out of your system, and your body has to replace it with fresh new blood.. . Cut down on your alcohol and caffeine intake; these strip your body of essential nutrients needed to fight disease (though about 4 cups of tea a day has been known to increase anti-oxidants in your body).  If you smoke, stop now!

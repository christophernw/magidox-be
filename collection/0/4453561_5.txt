Be as good and as true a person as you can be. Always think before you speak and try to consider other's feelings when expressing your opinions-- you can give your honest opinion, but think about the specific words you choose to describe your opinions. Smile at strangers and offer kind words of thanks and appreciation to everyone you can.. Sounds pretty basic, doesn't it? But, if we all did this with any kind of regularity, regardless of what kind of bad mood or day we've been having, I think PEACE WOULD BE ALL AROUND US!!

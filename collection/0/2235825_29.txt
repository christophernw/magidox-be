My father is a doctor (cancer speciallist) and says, . "Feeling sleepy after taking a meal is natural because the blood circulations turn to your stomach for proper digestion and in the brain the blood circulation becomes a bit less thats why when you do such things that requires brain, i mean deep thinking etc. you feel sleepy. Avoiding deep thinking & getting relaxed after your meal is the proper solution to your problem."

In all honesty, I believe there are people who want to do a fight just for the sake of a fight.  Somehow, somewhere, what America was founded on got lost in time.  Taxation without representation. Freedom of religion.  Freedom of choice.  The right to free education. The list goes on and on, it all got lost to who can over power whom.  Who's opinion matters most? We have slowly become a country who serves under a power of what I say goes.

What? I'm thinking of my atheist friends out here in real life, and they're some of the most upbeat and funny people I've ever met. They're bright, and tend to have a good sense of humor (usually twinged with high amounts of sarcasm, which I definitely appreciate). I'm a believer, but enjoy their company precisely because they're NOT moping, whining depression cases (unfortunately, some of my fellow church-goers are).

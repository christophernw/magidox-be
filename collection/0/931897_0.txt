Good interior design is about identifying and solving problems.. . Most of us become so familiar with the places where we live or work that we are unaware of the problems they cause. An interior designer has the advantage of seeing a space as a stranger and so is more aware of the problems.. . Creativity and imagination work together to produce an interior in which the problems have been resolved, and which is pleasant for the occupant.

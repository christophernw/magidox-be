Many newly remastered CD's have added bonus tracks. Also the technology has improved on how much digital information can be put on the CD from the early days in the 1980's. Often times they will remix the sound (purest types don't like this, even if it makes it sound better). There are several new formats such as SACD which sound better, at least I think it does. And my favorite is DVD audio disks which can have a PCM stereo mix and DTS and/or Dolby surround mixes on them. Really like Billy Cobham "Spectrum" disk, I own it in LP, CD and now DVD-A format.

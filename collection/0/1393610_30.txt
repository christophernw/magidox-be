Roosevelt started up a lot of work programs, like the WPA and CCC.  Lots of my uncles were really glad for the work.  Hoover didn't want a lot of government programs.. . Same comments about Social Security.. . Arguably Hoover was more isolationist than Roosevelt, who was spoiling to get the U. S. into the start of WWII in Europe.  There's little doubt that WWII and its aftermath ended the Depression - Roosevelt's work programs did little to help the unemployment and low farm prices.

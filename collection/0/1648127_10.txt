Try a covered litter box, or a bigger one like suggested. If shes a big girl she may have a hard time fitting into the box you have?. . I used a covered box for my boy (hes about 10 lbs). Its the Catty Corner litter box (I just tossed the sifter thing after a week, that part of its total crap). He really kicks his litter around and scratches, so it was getting all over. PetSmart used to sell it for like $18 but its not on the website or in MY local store anymore. If your local store doesnt have it Drsfosterandsmith.com has it for $29.99 which is the cheapest I've found.

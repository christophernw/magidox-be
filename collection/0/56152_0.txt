In addition to the great ideas by the above answerer, the college you work with (yes, Columbia is The Best around Chicago) will probably place you in an internship position toward the conclusion of your studies.  This will be the absolute best time for you to get your name out there, do some networking, and beg, beg, beg for a "real job" with a promoter once you've graduated.  If a known promoter will take you under their wing for a bit, their name on your resume and their good recommendation of your work will be gold in developing your own business down the road.  Good luck!

EVIDENCE FOR CREATION. . (as compiled by Creation Evidence Museum - Dr. Carl Baugh). . THE FOSSIL RECORD. . Evolutionists have constructed the Geologic Column in order to illustrate the supposed progression of “primitive” life forms to “more complex” systems we observe today. Yet, “since only a small percentage of the earth’s surface obeys even a portion of the geologic column…the claim of their having taken place to form a continuum of rock/life/time…over the earth is therefore a fantastic and imaginative contrivance."(1) “The lack of transitional series cannot be explained as being due to the scarcity of material. The deficiencies are real, they will never be filled.” (2) This supposed column is actually saturated with “polystrate fossils” (fossils extending from one geologic layer to another) that tie all the layers to one time-frame. “To the unprejudiced, the fossil record of plants is in favor of special creation.” (3). . 1.

E.J.H. Corner, CONTEMPORARY BOTANICAL THOUGHT. . DECAY OF EARTH’S MAGNETIC FIELD. . . Dr. Thomas Barnes, Emeritus Professor of Physics at the University of Texas at El Paso, has published the definitive work in this field. (4) Scientific observations since 1829 have shown that the earth’s magnetic field has been measurably decaying at an exponential rate, demonstrating its half-life to be approximately 1400 years. In practical application its strength 20,000 years ago would approximate that of a magnetic star. Under those conditions many of the atoms necessary for life processes could not form. These data demonstrate that earth’s entire history is young, within a few thousand years.. . 4. Thomas Barnes, ICR Technical Monograph #4, ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE EARTH’S MAGNETIC FIELD.. . THE GLOBAL FLOOD. . . The Biblical record clearly describes a global Flood during Noah’s day. Additionally, there are hundreds of flood traditions handed down through cultures all over the world. (5) M.E. Clark and Henry Voss have demonstrated the scientific validity of such a Flood providing the sedimentary layering we see on every continent. (6) Secular scholars report very rapid sedimentation and periods of great carbonate deposition in earth’s sedimentary layers. (7) It is now possible to prove the historical reality of the Biblical Flood. (8). . 5. Edward Blick, A SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF GENESIS; p. 103. . . 6. M.E. Clark and H.D.

The half-life of this element is 0.000164 seconds! To record the existence of this element in such short time span, the granite must be in crystalline state instantaneously. (10) This runs counter to evolutionary estimates of 300 million years for granite to form.. . (10) Robert Gentry –CREATIONN’S TINY MYSTERY). . HUMAN ARTIFACTS THROUGHOUT THE GEOLOGIC COLUMN. . Man-made artifacts – such as the hammer in Cretaceous rock, a human sandal print with trilobite in Cambrian rock, human footprints and a handprint in Cretaceous rock – point to the fact that all the supposed geologic periods actually occurred at the same time in the recent past.

Evolutionary theory requires millions of years in the formation of coal in order to afford time for the development of living organisms whose fossils are found in coal deposits. However, laboratory and field research has demonstrated that coal is formed

Cleanrooms are specially designed and built state of the art facilities that prevent contamination of dust germs and even noise in some cases. They are used to make drugs in the industry you refer to and are very restrictive.  You have to shower one or many times before entering one of those, you have to wear special clothing (they have it stored, dont worry) and in some cases, even gas masks.

Consider foremost the common values that bind the US with the Middle East's only democracy, then the strategic value to the US of a strong Israel.. . American aid to Israel was minimal until after the Six Day War, and only took off after Israel saved US ally Jordan from a PLO-Syrian invasion in 1970. The 1979 Camp David Accords, which secured peace between Israel and Egypt, mandated increased aid to Israel to compensate in part for Israel's return of the Sinai and the resulting loss of strategic depth, air bases, training grounds and oil fields. Israel's prescient destruction of Iraq's nuclear program in 1981 stopped Saddam Hussein from having nuclear weapons when he invaded Kuwait nine years later - nuclear weapons he could have used against US troops during the the first Gulf War.

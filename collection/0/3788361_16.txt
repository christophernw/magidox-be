Do not shave your dog unless of course its a poodle. All dogs shed, especially in the summer. However, the shedding could be from different types of skin problems. I am a pre-vet student and I work in a vet clinic, and we often prescribe medications that can help control the problem. Shedding is really just a characteristic of a dog. You can also keep your dog clean and brushed, but avoid over bathing your dog because you can cause their skin to become overly dry and cause the dog more problems.

As like as male, female have orgasm too during the sexual act or with the mastu*bation.. While for men the orgasm corresponds with the ejaculation for female it only is the apex of the excitement with some contraction of the sexual organs and often with production of a lubricating liquid thro the vagina walls. Generally women need more long time for reaching the orgasm and it can arrive more time consequentially too. On the contrary, the most part of the men, after the first orgasm (ejaculation) arenâ€™t more able to act consequentially.

Yes, Jesus was Jewish until He fulfilled the Old Law and brought in the New Law, which we call Christianity because we accepted Him as the Christ. The New Law allows us to eat pork, which was formerly forbidden.. My family happens to eat Tamales for Christmas. Yum! Our ancestors were from Castile, Spain, so that is our tradition.

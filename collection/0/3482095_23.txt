"The only thing that I know is that I know nothing" (Socrates). . What we call Reality is just the way human brain and senses capture part of the world. Thus everything we know is relative and limited and no-one can be 100% sure that they know the absolute and whole truth for something. . Usually there is the convention that when the information you have allows you to understand e.g. a system and predict correctly its behaviour and properties then you have sufficient knowledge of it.. For example, how do you know that a glass of water has no acetic acid inside it? . If it has a lot, then it will smell like vinegar and you know it's there.. If it is below the smell detection limit you go to chemical methods of analysis that can go down to very low levels but still there is no method to detect a compound on the level of a single molecule with 100% certainty-you would need standards to calibrate, measurement errors are always there.... But when you go down to such levels (like one molecule in a glass of water) that there is no detectable effect or phenomenon to reveal the existence of such a compound, you can say that you "know" it is absent, since there is no difference if there are actually undetetactable traces or not.. . Of course we should always be open-minded;progress provides new tools and reveals more information which can totally change what we think we "know". Just consider the people who once upon a time "knew" that the earth was flat.

Morelia is a great city to visit all year round. . The average temperature is between 16 to 20 degrees Celsius.. During the summer months you might experience some very hot days above 35 degrees Celsius, but is is not very common.. . I've been in Morelia many times and the best months are May and September. In both months you can also do a lot of cultural activities. May is the month when Morelias was founded and September is Mexico's National month.

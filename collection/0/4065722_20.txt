Consider this a bottle of water cost approximately $1.00 at the store today and 3/4 of the earth is covered with it. that's $10.00 or more a gallon. There is only a finite amount of oil on the planet so it not going to get any better. I predict $5.00 or more a gallon by 2010 when people start to seriously consider alternative modes of transportation

Dear Rick: Unless a weapon is used in a felony and one or more are involved people can stand by and watch crime happen. There are no laws requiring people to call 911 if a crime is being committed. If you were taken hostage in a bank heist (felony) are you guilty? I believe fear for one's life free's them from guilt.

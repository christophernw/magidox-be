It's only part of a sentence which doesn't really mean anything by itself.  It could be translated as "helps me.". . The simplest complete sentence with this phrase would be "Vous m'aidez" which means "You help me.". . The imperitive (command) would be "Aidez-moi."  That would translate as "Help me."

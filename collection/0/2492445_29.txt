Because if I ordered "Dead cow" at a restaurant, it would be a very complicated process. There are lots of different kinds of dead cow one can eat, and I could potentially confuse my waiter. I prefer to be more specific, using words such as "hamburger", "steak", and "beef". I'm just trying to help out the waitstaff.

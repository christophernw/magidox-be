There are several reasons a person might be motivated to be intellectually superior: power, fame, and success are just a few of the more obvious reasons. And its not just intellectual superiority that some people are looking for; some people just have an unquenchable desire to excel above and beyond all others. These people are your Mozart's, Newtons, Skinners, Michelangelo's, etc, so obviously there is something to it.

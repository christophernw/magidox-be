in general no democracy has ever lasted very long,  America was formed to be a republic, where the need of the government and all people held an importance.. . Now that America is switching thier government to a more pure democractic system,  This normally allows for corruption and control by fringe groups ( which we see happening)  It weakens a nation to such a point that there is either a military or civil revolt or the country is taken over by another nation.

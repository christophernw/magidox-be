I'm not tolerant, I'm apathetic, so I probably can't give a whole lot of insight into this.  But I see tolerance to be the acceptance that everyone is seperate and unique from their inborn traits and should only be held accountable for things they have control over.  . . Tolerance is about choices, and how to increase the number of choices people can make for themselves.  Anything that limits choice in intolerant.  Anything that removes choices from the people is intolerant.  . . Tolerance is about life and individualism.  Make your own life, your own choices, and be held accountable only for the harm you cause others.  . . Almost no one is perfectly tolerant.  The world thrives on conflict.

No standard chemical reaction will turn Lead into Gold.. Lead has 3 extra protons which seperates it from Gold, if you wanted to remove those protons [overcoming the strong nuclear force] with some insanely expensive nuclear reaction, go ahead.. . Lots of people (alchemists) tried to chemically turn Lead into Gold, all were unsuccessfuly, since in any standard chemical reaction, it is really the electrons that are doing all the work, the nucleus stays out of it.

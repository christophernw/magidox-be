when two different atoms (ie O-H) form a bond, the nucleus of one atom will have a higher attraction for the electrons being shared.  Because of the higher attraction the electron is drawn to that atom and it will be more negatively charged, while the other atom will be more positively charged, thereby forming a polar bond.

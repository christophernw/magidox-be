Curve smells good.  Its a little on the feminine side. They all depend on a person's body chemistry though. Dunhill original(Foley's and Dillards etc)is so HHHHHOOOTTT!  So is Burberry Brit.  Dolce and Gabbana is yummy.  Armani-Aqua de Gio.  If you want something less expensive Halston (think its called Z14)is good so is aviation or aviator(Target or Walmart) and Stetson Black are good too.

i have a "theory".  god created mankind.  the devil desires to be like God.  what if the devil, not having the power to create life, found a way to alter life.  through evolution he kills two birds with one stone. first he gets to play God and create a man, second this is able to cause a reasonable doubt, a glitch in the biblical explanation.

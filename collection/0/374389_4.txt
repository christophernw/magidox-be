Iran is not one of the most responsible countries in the World.  We have a moral obligation to look out for others as well as for our own people.  Would you want one of your ten year old neighborhood bullies to carry a handgun to school and be allowed to attend there with your own children?  Would you want a new next-door neighbor to be allowed to cook up Meth in his side yard next to your kitchen?  Think about it as you eat this afternoon or this evening.  Talk to your friends about these.  They are similar in nature to what you are asking about.

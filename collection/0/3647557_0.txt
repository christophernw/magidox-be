While you can probably keep your bed free of dust mites by proper and regular cleaning, you cannot make your bed free of fungi and bacteria. There are fungal spores in the air - however, they usually won't start growing on your bed unless it tends to be damp (stop peeing in bed!). As for bacteria, there will always be bacteria on it especially since there are bacteria that normally inhabit your skin.

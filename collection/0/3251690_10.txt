Talk about being hate filled towards people from another country!!!. True, there will be people who don't care what goes on in another country besides their own. But that's not JUST AMERICANS. Every country has their share of those people. And if you deny that, then YOU are ignorant.. To be honest, I think we should know a bit about what is going on outside, but I don't believe that we have to make it our life's goal to know EVERYTHING that goes on elsewhere! Why? Because when you get caught up in other country's business's and problems they you don't have time to look at your own country's and before you know it your nation has crumbled.. May I ask you something? Why in God's Name does it bother you anyway?

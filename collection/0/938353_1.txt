"Industry lingo that has come to connote a sharp drop in the financial markets. The first Black Friday occurred on September 24, 1869. A group of financiers attempted to corner the gold market, which caused a panic and then an economic depression. The panic of 1873 also began on Friday.". . A name that means a sudden drop in prices..... . The first friday after thanksgiving is technically the first day to shop for xmas gifts.... most retailers try to kick off the holiday shopping season by having ridiculously low prices...... . Stoking the fires if you will.... but none the less... a day marked with severely decreased prices... ergo...a black friday.

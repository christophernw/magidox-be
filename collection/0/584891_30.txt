I think Snape is one of the most complex, in-depth, compelling characters in recent fiction.  . . Without writing a 400 paragraph essay, I think the bottom line is that Dumbledore did ask Snape to do it for whatever reason.  There are many things surrounding Dumbledore's death that have been rehashed over and over, and while I agree there's some things that don't add up, my opinion is that he is in fact dead.  . . I don't know whether Snape's reasons for his actions are self-serving at all, but I believe that the "revulsion" etched on his face when performing the curse was revulsion for what he had to do, not revulsion for Dumbledore.. . I'm not certain he'll be a "hero" by the end of book 7, but I highly doubt he'll be a total villain.  Dumbledore trusted him completely, and I think that's important.   Dumbledore has certainly proven he is capable of making mistakes ("I make mistakes like the next man but being--forgive me--rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger."), but I don't think this is one of them.  The fact that they planned this together, the fact that Dumbledore pleaded with Snape to do as he asked, and the fact that Snape loathed the position he was in all illustrate just how much unwavering trust Dumbledore had in Snape.. . I think book 7 will reveal more clearly WHY Dumbledore trusted Snape, perhaps trusted him above all others.

it is present in bones, which strengthens them.. Also, it is involved in nerve transmission. the nerve impulse needs to travel between one nerve to another. as the impulse reaches the end of one nerve, calcium flows into the synapse (end), and this stimulates nerve transmitter sustances (eg acetylcholine) to cross the gap, and they open the channels at the other side for the impulse to move accross and move through. then the calcium diffuses away from the synapse.

I think that many teens smoke because their friends or their significant others smoke.  It's more that they're trying to fit in than be cool.  They might think that smoking makes them cool, but I think they start when they are with a group of people who are smoking, and it seems natural.  Soon, they're hooked, and think it's fine to smoke. even if they are told that it will hurt them.

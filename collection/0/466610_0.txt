When I say I know something, I have certainty of it.  Like if I say, "I know I had my keys when I got into the car."  I am certain of it.  I have a factual reasoning for it.  Either it's been drilled in my head (1+1=2), or I have this tactile, visual, or audio memory of it. (Keys were digging in my pocket.) . . I might also say I know, to tell someone I understand what they are saying--as an active listener.  However in that case, I will be honest, I don't alway KNOW.  I am just keeping conversation moving along so they can say what needs to be said.. . I might also say, I know to play a bluff.  Because when you say "I know," it usually sends a signal you have knowledge or certainty and others will usually tell you if you are wrong or right.  For example, as I might say, "I know you are mad a me," to someone to find out if they truelly are or at least live in the illusion that they are not if they say no. I guess in that regard it's kind of an olive branch too.. . So it could mean a few things, but I guess mostly it means certainty or at least to give the impression of certainty to create dialog.

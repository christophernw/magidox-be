Fever occurs when the bodyâ€™s immune response is triggered by pyrogens (fever-producing substances). Pyrogens usually come from a source outside the body and, in turn, stimulate the production of pyrogens inside the body. Pyrogens tell the hypothalamus to increase the temperature set point of the body.

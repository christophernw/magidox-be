Good question with no good answer.. . I believe it's because our President can feel good about himself.  He probably believes that if the U.S. can flex our muscles in foreign countries that people will grow to respect us.. . Let's face it, the United States is now viewed as a bully.  The president is trying to impose our beliefs upon the rest of the world because our beliefs are best.  Yeah.  Right.  . . Look at all the money being spent to fund the war when that money could be used to strenghen our own borders (would solve illegal immigration issue) and improve the lives of the American people.. . At least Bush will be out of office soon, of course, that doesn't mean anything will improve.

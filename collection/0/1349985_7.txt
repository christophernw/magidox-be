I found this in researching your question: . "...The Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to a Harvard proposal to test the benefits of the illegal street drug known as "ecstasy" in patients diagnosed with severe anxiety related to advanced cancer.. The drug, also known as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA, has been referred to by psychiatrists as an "empathogen," a drug especially good at putting people in touch with their emotions. Some believe it could help patients come to terms with the biggest emotional challenge of all: the end of life.". In other words, ecstacy is being TESTED to see if it has any medicinal value in helping terminally ill [and/or] cancer patients, as well as diagnosed PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) patients. The emphasis is on medicinal value; it is not being tested for use by party/crack heads who want to damage their remaining brain cells.... Hope this helps!

Dogs will not dig up decorative lava rock...so, cover the ground in your flower beds with the rock.. . I leave one area for the dog to dig, and place toys and other fun stuff there to encourage destruction in that area.. . All other dig spots get a handful of lava rock.  Once the area is no longer of interest, I remove the rock and replace the grass.

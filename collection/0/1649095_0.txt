The flow rate in CFM (cubic feet per minute) is often used for compressible gases.  Therefore it is usually also necessary to indicate the pressure and temperature.  For ratings of fans and blowers at atmospheric conditions, it may be assumed that standard temperature and pressure at sea level are intended and will be close enough for most application (except high on a mountain?).

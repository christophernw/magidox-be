If you have to ask how to change plugs, I'd suggest you take it to a dealer.  Or else buy a Chilton manual for your particular car.  It's a good $20 book that shows you how to do just about everything you want with your vehicle except fiddle with the ABS and airbags.  That stuff is for professionals.

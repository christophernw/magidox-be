Participating in Yahoo Answers has helped me to develop a thicker skin and realize that I can be very good when interacting with other people.  After noticing that I'm doing good with people here, I am able to be more confident when I interact with others in real life.  It also feels good to be able to share my thoughts and to learn at the same time.

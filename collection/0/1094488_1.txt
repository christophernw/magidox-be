KenC, yo!, hikkileyeah, and nobody in general are all wrong; the other 3 are correct.  It's not the weakness of gravity, it's the high speed with which the travel and the lack of air to slow them down.  Without gravity, they'd just fling into space and never return--the orbit depends on a strong gravitaional pull.

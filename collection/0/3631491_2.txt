sounds to me like you have a GM vehicle 96 or newer.  If so that stuff is the GM dexcool that got low and got air in the system.  Once these systems get air in them they will gum up and turn to mud.  If what I said is accurate about the GM thing then I would go to a garage and get it flushed and have them put the standard green coolant in it and replace the cap and then just get it changed every 2 years or 30k miles.  If it is not a GM product then it is probably just rust and you will need a flush anyway.

I'm a little confused on the question. Are you asking "why be a gay man, because it is so difficult?" or "why is being a gay man so difficult?" First, if you are a gay man then that's all you can be. You can't, and I stress this, can't change a persons sexuality....try very hard to understand that..ok? You can't just up and switch to heterosexuality...it just doesn't work that way. Being a gay man can be difficult as some of society just LOVES to beat the hell out someone who is different...some enjoy just being mean and hateful...it makes them feel safe. I on the other hand have realized that it is they (the mean & hateful) that have the problem..not me...AMEN.

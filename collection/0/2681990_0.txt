In the arctic regions, the ice is primarily sea ice (the very high latitudes near the North Pole are open ocean below the ice). However, there are significant areas of land in high latitudes as well. (Greenland is a prime example). Over the land, the ice behaves as what is is, a plastic substance--one that flows subject to the force of gravity. Over time, this ice flows down until it extends over open ocean below. Eventually, the weight of the ice overcomes its tensile strength and pieces of it break off as icebergs. (the iceberg that sank the Titanic in 1912 was such a berg.) Over the South Polar regions the ice forms strictly on land The area under the South Poole  is land, not ocean as at the North Pole. This ice also pushes out but at a much slower rate. Also, since the South Pol;ar regions have colder winters than the North ( an effect of the tipping of the earth's axis to the plane of its orbit) this South Polar ice becomes much thicker. As a result, it extends in many cases far, far out to sea, and when it eventually breaks off, it does so in the form of enormous tabular icebergs, many with areas the size of some countries. These are clearly visible, and have been photographed from, space.

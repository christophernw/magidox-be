There's a difference between the neutral safety switch and the clutch safety switch. If you have a standard transmission, there is usually a switch that is mounted somewhere on the clutch linkage that prevents the car from starting without the clutch pedal pushed down- this is, therefore, the clutch safety switch. Automatic transmissions, however, don't have them as there is no external, manual clutch. The neutral safety switch will be inside or attached to the transmission preventing the engine from starting in any gear other than neutral or park. With cars that start so easily, as our electronically tuned engines do today, this keeps someone from starting the car in gear (especially kids) and the car taking off on it's own.

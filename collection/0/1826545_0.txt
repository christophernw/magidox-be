So many people died so fast that bodies rotted in houses because the gravediggers couldn't keep up.  So many died (guesses range from a quarter to a third of the population) that large swaths of farmland went untended and reverted to forest over the next thirty years or so.  So many died that the survivors must have thought it was truly the end of the world.

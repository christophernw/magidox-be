I'm English,surely you know not all Americans voted for bush and. even the ones that did cant be blamed for the presidents actions.. (i didn't vote labour,but if i had say i didn't agree with the war). would it be my fault that tony Blair lied to millions about wmd. No of course not democracy isn't perfect and once you vote,. the power is no longer yours, our leaders do as they please.. so stop American bashing(nobody hates the bush admin more. than me)and get real!

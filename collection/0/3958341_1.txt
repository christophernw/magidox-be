From the title of Aldous Huxley's book of 1932.  He in turn got the title from Shakespeare's 'The Tempest' - "Oh wonder, how many goodly creatures are there here, how beautious mankind is, oh Brave New World that has such people in it.". . Huxley used the title ironically to describe the book's Utopian world where scientific 'advance' has created a system in which the individual exists for the state and not otherwise.

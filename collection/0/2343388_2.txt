It will partly depend on the severity of the electrocution.. . However the first thing to do in any electrocution (indeed any situation you come across) is to check for danger - you're not going to be any help if you get hurt too! Isolate any electricity supplies at the mains, or even better, at the fuse board BEFORE touching the casualty or going anywhere near them. . . The casualty may be conscious or unconsious. If they're conscious, just call an ambulance and while waiting for them, see if you can find where the entry and exit marks are - the electricity will have either passed over the surface of the body, causing burns (treat with cold running water for 10 mins or a cold compress if you can not get the affected part to running water), otherwise the electricity will have gone through the body and have caused an internal burn.. . If the casualty is unconscious, check their airway and see if you can check for breathing, call an ambulance, and they will instruct you to do CPR if necessary. Continue until the ambulance people take over (don't just stop because they have arrived). If they are not breathing, it is likely their heart has stopped too, so if you're in a place that has a defibrillator available - get someone to bring it to you, it will give them the best chance of survival and they're really easy to use.

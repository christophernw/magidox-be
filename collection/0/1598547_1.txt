George Bush (Dick Cheney, really) and his minions want to remove the power that is controlling Iraq. And put someone of their same evil world conquering mindset into power. We have done this with many countries in South/Central America.. . So until we have a leader in Iraq who George Bush and the United Nations agrees with (and has placed there), the war will continue.

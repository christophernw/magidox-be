You might like to know the following, due to circumstances beyond my control I had to start wearing a kilt, or not go out, or wear shorts..   I started to wear a kilt, what a difference, I sometimes go out walking the dog regimental because it is so comfortable but the side effects have been interesting, and apparently supported by medical evidence. .   Firstly after about 10 days many noticed I had become less aggressive and drove slower, that at 60 I now had gone back to waking up in the morning with a wotsit something not noticed for 20 years, and that women treated me differently and, on reflection   due to no "box". I now love my kilts and prefer them to trousers and although still have the excuse to wear the kilts I will not willingly go back to trousers..   I am also trying to find a source of comfortable underwear, however the search is not fairing well, either here or in the UK..   Many men have said they are jealous that I do it and that they have no excuse and excuse the pun not the balls, but the consensus is that men are in general, not happy with their clothing, especially underwear.

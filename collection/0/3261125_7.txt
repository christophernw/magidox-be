The below info used hot water and coffee for the experiment. It has diagrams, as you will read below. To get to the website go to:  http://www.iupac.orgdiac/Didac%20Eng/. . You could probably substitute your effervescent tablets for the coffee. Good Luck tomorrow.. . The left-hand side of the illustration shows a coffee maker. This is a type of extraction in which a suitable solvent (hot water, the extraction liquid) is added to the solid mixture (ground coffee beans) in order to dissolve one or more of the components.. . The use of hot water increases the speed at which the components dissolve and also increases the solubility of the components that are to be extracted. In addition to the extraction step in the coffee machine, there is also a filtration step. The coffee is thus a filtrate that can be further separated into its solid and liquid components. If the water is evaporated off the extracted ingredients crystallise out, this being the basis of instant coffee.. . In the middle of the illustration a Soxhlet apparatus is shown. This type of apparatus is used for continuous extraction. First the mixture, either solid - solid or solid - liquid is placed in the extraction thimble. The extraction solvent is then warmed, and rises via the right-hand side arm until it reaches the spherical condenser. Here the solvent condenses and drips back into the extraction thimble, where the substance that is to be extracted now dissolves. When the extraction-solvent has risen to the overflow-level, it flows via the siphon on the left-hand side back into the flask underneath. This process continues to run until the heater is switched off. The extracted substances are found in the flask, dissolved in the solvent.

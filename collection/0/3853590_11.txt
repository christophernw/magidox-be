Well, Jews have been abused for so long that you cannot truly answer that question. From ancient times the Jews have been blamed for things such as the Black Plague, to the down fall of the German Empire. I dont know what drives the hate rd of these people, but I do know thats its been there since the beginning of history. I would blame it on a clash of cultures. Thats just the way it is. I also know that Jews are not the only religion that has been prosecuted. Christians were attacked by the Roman Emperor Nero during 64 A.D. Muslims were attacked by the "Nights Templar" during the crusades. All religions have been prosecuted at one point or another.

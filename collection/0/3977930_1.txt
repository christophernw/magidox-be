First base it on your budget. Then determine which picture looks best to you and has the features you're looking for. In todays market, the overall difference in quality between any two manufacturers is becoming almost negligible. In the "old days", Sony was the best, but not anymore. Now they're basically just overpriced. If you want to pay for the name, by all means go with a Sony.

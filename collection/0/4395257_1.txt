He betrayed Jesus by telling the soldiers where to find him so they could end up crucifying him.  He got 30(?) pieces of silver for the information and then changed his mind after he had already told them.  They wouldn't take the money back because it was blood money, so it was used to buy land where poor people could be buried.  Judas ended up killing himself.

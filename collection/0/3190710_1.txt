Well these are mean suggestions, and I am an animal lover, but if they are annoying you try this.. . Get a high powered (long distance) squirt gun, and sqirt them until they get the message that by your window making noise is not the area to be.. . Get some firecrackers, light a few close to the area and the noise will scare them off.. . And if you really believe these cats don't have homes, collect them up and take them to a no kill animal shelter so they can be adopted and become someone elses problem noisemakers.. . If you know the cats have homes, but they come in your yard anyway, the above suggestions should help keep them from your area.

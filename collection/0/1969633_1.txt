American government has to understand the simple truth, pollution is directly linked to climate change and therefore inevitably the destruction of human kind. America is the biggest polluter in the world, just one country for 25% . Doesn't that mean any thing, to any body. I am so pleased with the European unions efforts and approach to this problem. Specially Germany and Briton.I know Americans want to something about it, but as far I can see president is too busy milking male horses ( his wife said that).

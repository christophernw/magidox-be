Yes it was rude but it was a necessary rude.  I am a Christian and I do not like it when people do that to me or anyone else.  They do not do their mission they just make you uncomfortable.  As for the obsessed part he's not obsessed he's fallowing the "great commission" found in the Bible.. . Matthew 28:18&19. . "Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.  Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Fater and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.'". . Note nothing is said about "go and tell them either fallow Me or they're going to hell"

Yes, I am happy to be an atheist. Before I "found the light" I was angry with god for not doing anything to help innocent children who are sick or starving to death all around the world, when I had been taught about all the miracles he used to do, and dropped "Manna" onto the jewish people when they needed food in the wilderness. It is really nice to know now that those are just fairytales with a few morals thrown in like Esope's fables, and not a "captain's log" of stuff that actually happened. It's more productive for us as humans to realize that WE need to drop food from the sky (from planes and choppers) to help those people, instead of praying for help that will never come.

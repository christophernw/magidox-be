What is wrong with owning slaves, Ever person who pays taxes is a slave. Owned by the government. Slavery has been around for all of history and no it is not a sin. People who were poor often sold them selfs into service in order to pay what they had borrowed. Often this was done to kinsmen. Some time a widow would do it to feed her children. So as with all forms of employment this is just another form of bondage. If you will notice there were ordances about how to treat them and also for there walfare.

Whether it's Pom, Pommy or Pommie, this is a term Australians and New Zealanders use for the English, sometimes affectionately and sometimes not. It's most evident when it comes to cricket and rugby matches. It's not certain where it comes from, bukt some say it favours the blend of the words 'pomegranate' and 'immigrant': the pomegranate bit referring to the ruddy complexions of the English arriving in a hot climate.

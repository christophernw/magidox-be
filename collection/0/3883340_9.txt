Because we dont F*ck with the judge and make the prosecutors job easy. Also we are admitting guilt over the stupid sh*t we have done, its a start on the path to correction.. . I mean really think about it, if you were the prosecuter and some @sshole just broke the law and is trying to fight you on everything when you BOTH KNOW he commited the crime, are you going to go easy on him or let the dumbf*ck have it for giving you sh*t.

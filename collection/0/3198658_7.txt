It help us to consider others, and with it, is the only way we can live in harmony.. It's a break, to stop us from being a selfish.. It's not same as just feeling guilty of what you've done, like even some animals do have, it's more focusing on awareness of others.. Tender loving care to others is not something  people do out of guiltiness, rather, it's an act of conscience.. Without it, we human will turned into a most greedy monster in universe, as some already has.

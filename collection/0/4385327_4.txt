You not only need more pixels, you need quality of pixels. Canon is the only one for best quality, well depending on what kind of professional work it is for.. . You can buy Canon EOS 5D which is 12.8 million pixels with full size image sensor that means there is no magnification on the lenses.. . But if you want a camera which can give you nearest to film quality then buy Mamiya medium format (film camera) and buy a digital back for it which will give you more than 20 million pixels. There is no better quality beyond that but the digital back costs more than £10,000 and Canon EOS 5D will cost approx £2000 pounds.

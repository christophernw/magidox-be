no such thing...Art is WORK! You have to DO IT to get it done. It's not some "metaphysical" happening....If you're a painter, paint something...a writer, write something. A prof told me 1 in 10 things actually succeed in the creative experience, so think of everything as a PRACTICE, not a Masterpiece

Pleural effusion is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space  as a result of excessive transduction or exudation from the pleural surfaces. . Pleural cavity contains normally less than 20 ml of fluid.  . Tuberculosis is the commonest cause  and effusion is due primarily to hyper sensitivity reaction to tuberculous protein.

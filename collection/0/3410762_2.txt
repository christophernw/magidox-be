This is funny. If an Afro-American mentions slavery, he is told to get over it. Jews, however, have assured that noone will forget the holocaust. Call me anti-semetic if you want, but I know more about the Jewish Holocaust than my own, damn near, due to the semantics of today's classrooms. But that's just another, annoying black man complaining about slavery. Amazing what the inclusion, or absence of a word can do to context. Just like "looking for food" and "looting" when reffering to Hurricane Katrina, which Bush acted on in record time, of course.

The key is prevention (aka upstream thinking ;-)) . . Wash your hands with luke warm water and soup for at least 30 sec, sing the happy birthday song. . . Stop touching your eyes, nose and mouth. It is such a common habbit.. just count it on people around you or on yourself... This is the most common route and most people don't realize it... ask a microbiologist~~ . . Vaccination and immunization also prevent and are very important. Sometimes, we take our health for granted.. . Virus is different from bacteria. Please don't expect to get an antibiotic for it.. just be patient and take some extra TLC of yourself..

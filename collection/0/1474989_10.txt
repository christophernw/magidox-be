I could really give you an explanation, based, not in what I know, but what I have LIVED and felt for myself.. . But you will have to open your mind, and consider certain things that, otherwise, wouldnt allow you to go on with certain reasonings...or facts, but for you they are not, since you have no access to certain things.. . Most people that die young, that have accidents or that they come in very delicate situations during a particular lifetime, they are, in fact, being karmatic about that experience and its a way to just release energy that they have carried for a while from their previous incarnations.. . I wont go on, cause what i have to say next, from own experience, its too controversial, but that is an explanation right there... just be aware, that there are some others that have it easier *not the richest, dont be so materialistic, that the richest are mostly the poorest in spirit, but not all, but most...*. . Those who manage to solve their problems, and then dedicate their lifes to study themselves and the invisible laws, will discover the doors to the other dimensions, where all of these, and much more, is clearly explained, lived, and EXPERIENCED.....AT WILL.

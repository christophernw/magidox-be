Consider the fact that time itself is part of the universe and so started at the Big Bang. With this, it simply makes no sense to talk about 'before the Big Bang'. It's like asking what is north of the north pole. The analogy is reasonably accurate since the description of the Big Bang singularity is similar to the singularity that you see at the north pole (although worst because the geometry itself is singular, not just the coordiante system).

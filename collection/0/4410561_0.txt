Hmmmm, is this a trick question?. . Anyhow, after getting out of bed in a pair boxers, I paw my way out into the yard, get knocked around and licked by the dawgs, giv'em hugs, breakfast, and fresh water, come back in looking like a wreck, then slowly open my eyes in the shower...  After making sure the espresso machine doesn't bite, I'll pump some coffee out of it and mix in with some sweetened condensed milk, remember to stir for at least 10 times.  It's now time to locate all the remotes for the Media Center PC, TV, and Speakers, and hoping it actually recorded BBC News while I was slacking away in the night...

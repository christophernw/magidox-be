Where I live (Alabama), they seem to be seasonal.  Of course, a professional setting is where I see most of the fashion trends, so that may not be very accurate.. . HOWEVER, I know that as SOON as it gets close to warm enough for them, I start wearing them.  My feet like to breath and they hate wearing shoes all the time.  The flip flop - ah they are like heaven.  Not only do my feet get the space they desire, but when I walk, there is this pleasant (to me) flopping noise that reminds me of a good joke.. . I wore my flops today, actually.

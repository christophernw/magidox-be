Like buying any other generator, first you need to determine how many kw's you will need. DO NOT listen to the first poster as you don't want one too large as running it way below or way above its ratting is not good for long term engine life. You also don't want to burn more fuel then you need to, and make sure you get one that runs at 1800 rpm and NOT 3600.

1. Iran didn't threaten Israel, the Iranian president said it should be wiped off map, and it doesn't mean anything, and is just a slogan.. 2. Israel won't dare attacking Iran, cause it knows how much military power iran has. If the war happens it would be some thing like the war between Iraq and Iran. All the western and Arabic countries supported Iraq, but Iran relied on it's people and won the war, even though it ended with a peace agreement, every one knows the winner of that war was Iran.. 3. Western countries won't let Israel attack Iran. Iran is one of the world's biggest suppliers of oil. The price of oil is currently about 60 dollars, with a war the price is going to be about 80-90 dollars, and it would cause unrecoverable damages to the economy of western countries.. 4. Iran is much larger than Israel and has a bigger and stronger army. The power of the armies of both countries almost matches up in air force, and navy. But iran has a much stronger Army. Israel is small so if Iran target Israel with missle, Israel will experience unrecoverable damages. But Israel can't target Iran with missles, and if it does it can't make that much of a damage.( Note the new anti missle and aircraft systems Iran bought from Russia, which covers the entire western parts of Iran.) . 5. There are alot of american forces around Iran that if Israel attacks and U.S. supports it, Iran can easily hit them. . 6. Iran has alot of allies around Israel. Syria, Lebanon, and even Palestine.. 7. People of Iran fully support it in war, even if they hate their government, the spirit of Iranians is that they won't let any foreign person or country rule over them, and as they did in the war between Iran and Iraq they will fully support their country in the war.. 8. God is with Iranians. Iranians have a strong faith in god, and with that faith they can do anything.

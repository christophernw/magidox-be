I don't know the situation so I'll try to answer as best I can.. . Choose to have happy thoughts, happy, happy, happy, happy now say with me. I'm going to be happy with these people, I'm going to love them even though they are worthless, there still important to someone and I'm going to really look for the good in them. They do have something to offer and I'm going to find out what it is. . . All joking aside, we can choose to look at the bad in people or we can choose to find the good. It is all really a choice and sometimes it is very hard, but when I look back on my life and some of the people who I love today, I have to admit had I not of taken the approach I did I would of missed out on some fantastic friendships. Some of my friends really were annoying and drove me crazy, but like I said they are great once I got to know them. Too often people tend to have preconcieved notions about someone or a race and instead of finding out for themselves they just continue on with that un fortunatly they really miss out. I love people and I love to learn from them and we never know when that stranger or annoyance will change your life for the better if you let them. We live in a great world with great people it's just do you look at it that way. I give everyone the benefit of the doubt until they prove me wrong then I go my own way but I'm at peace then.  Take care and choose to look for the GOOD in people it is sooo much better.  Sorry about any typo or incorrect spelling.

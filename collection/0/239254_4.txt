Tell her to put another quarter in and you can listen to 50-cent. :P. . Seriously, it depends on how far the quarter is in, and the type of CD player. You could take it to the shop and they would likely have the proper tools. If you want to take a crack at it yourself, use something like a wire coat hanger. Untwist it, and rebend the hook so it's almost L shaped (like a 70 degree angle). Use that to fish it out, but be careful not to scratch the lens for the laser.

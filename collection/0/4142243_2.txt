We need to learn to understand different cultures and viewpoints.Democracy can't be spread throughout the world by imposing it.It has to be assimilated into different cultures. The western world must comprehend that other cultures have their own traditions,behaviours, language, religion that needs to be acknowledged and don't want changed for the sake of democracy and freedom. As long as diversity exists, there is no hope for a universal state to achieve peace.

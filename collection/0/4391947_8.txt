Well some people around here are already decorating, before it gets really cold (n. illinois) but I can't do it til after thanksgiving for I will be out of town for 2 weeks. I think you shouldn't do it before thanksgiving though but thats really just my idea. Because Christmas is for winter, & before thanksgiving its the fall so it should be fall decor then. But like I said its my opinion.

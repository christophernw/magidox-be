Who CARES!!!!!!!!!!! I don't, ship ALL illegal immigrants out,  If they can't obey law 1 in coming here, send them home.....If they came in a little boat, send them home in a little boat,  If they crossed a desert 1 way, turn them around where they are, 1 gallon of water and a kick in the butt..............we don't need them.........It's  been happening tooooooooo long with no one doin anything...This country is going to look like mexico sooner than later, Why do we as a country, have to celebrate Cinco De Mayo???...If you are here legally GREAT, GLAD TO HAVE YOU HELP PAY TAXES & SUPPORT OUR GOVERNMENT.......GOD BLESS & MAY ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE.............I think it's brought up now because of the quantity of illegals from mexico, the deaths in Arizona & Texas of them trying to cross the border & our government, trying to get votes............

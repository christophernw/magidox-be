God Almighty has always been existent and always will exist.  God has written the destinies of everything in this universe long before they happen.  He merely has to say be and it will be.  If we try and answer all these issues we will eat our minds out.  It is better to accept that God has created the universe and leave it at that.  . . On another note touching on the issue of science and creation.  God created the earth, science and everything which occupies the earth.  How could science have made earth if God created science?  It is too contradictory.  God is the greatest he has always been there ever since and always will be there.

According to the Holy Bible i believe in, . God did create us to be with Him, no sufferings and hurt (it's all in Genesis Book).. BUT, Adam and Eve failed to obey God, and even doubted God's good intention. and they sinned.. not only them, all of us also are sinners. we reject God, but He still provides salvation: Jesus paid our sins on the cross. . So God wants us to live a life to its fullest, reunited to Him. But, human always dun believe it, and reject God.. so it's up to your choice now, wanna be with Him, or get hurt and suffer down here?. Experience God, so even somebody hurts us, all we can feel is compassion and forgiveness to him/her.

A subliminal message is one that is perceived by the mind, but is not perceived consciously........they used to say that during the cartoons at the drive-in theatres the words would flash so quickly that the eye couldn't see them, but that the "brain" could read them:  "you're thirsty", "you're hungry", etc.--and that, supposedly made you hungry or thirsty.  these would be considered subliminal messages.  now, as to what a subliminal "messenger" might be?????  perhaps the person who creates the messages???

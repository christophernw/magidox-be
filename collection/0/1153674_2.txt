Cats don't stop using the litter box, it's not something they grow out of or that you can "break" them of. Why are you getting another cat if you don't wan to deal with the smell? My advice would be to keep your cats inside so they aren't subject to disease or injury and to buy another litter box. You should have 1 per cat anyway.

quick warmup is running, or if you are in a small area jumping jacks works too. or even just jumping up and down... anything.. . its to get your body started into exercising, and you will be able to get more out of your heavy exercises this way and it will not cause any shock to your body if you immediately go to heavy exercises. its like stretching before exercising also. (warmup before you stretch, it helps you stretch out better)

Depends on how you mean to lighten up. If you mean by letting more immoral things just fly by- totally disagree. Look how much sex is on t.v. now-a-days it's disgusting.. . If you mean by ignoring the trivial stuff like gossiping and stupid immature stuff- then absolutely, too many people focus on the small picture that they ignore the bigger one.... . Take care and God Bless

well the reason it has been getting so much media attention is because only recently it was discoverd that Darfur has huge oil fields.  therefore haliburton and the major oil companies cant get a piece of the action while darfur is under a muslim government.  so what better way to start a conflict to get oil.  does Iraq ring a bell?

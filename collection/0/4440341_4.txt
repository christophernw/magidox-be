"No, you're an adult, and I have confidence that you can get your car back by your own hard work friend; I'm not in a position where I will help you.". . Be ready to witness him throwing a temper tantrum!!! It sounds like your buddy never grew up and still kicks and screams when he does not get his way.  You're actually helping him by forcing him to take ownership of his own responsabilites.  Your friendship will most likly cease after this, but remember, in the long run, you're being the best friend by letting him stand on his own two feet!!!

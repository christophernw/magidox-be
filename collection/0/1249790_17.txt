"Get it through people's skulls that 'god' exists?". . That sounds like force to me.  Isn't religion or spirituality or personal relationships all about CHOICE?  Not force?. . _IF_ I am to become a christian or to accept Jesus, I would rather do all the effort....meaning I do the research, the learning, studying the bible in depth, the whole thing myself.  That way, the spiritual path would mean so much more to me.  :-)   If it was "forced" upon me, then the spiritual path won't mean diddly to me.  :-(. . Right now, I cannot believe in "god" or accept Jesus as "god" either cuz to do so would mean I am being dishonest with myself.   I rather say I am an atheist and be very honest with myself.  If I am honest with myself, then I can be more honest with other people.  :-)

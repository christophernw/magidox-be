Okay... A maintenance required light needs to be reset, as a separate function of the oil change being done... you can do either without doing the other.. . Most dealerships operate in good faith, and the work was probabaly done, but the mechanic forgot to reset the light.. The best way to tell if the oil was changed is:  check the dipstick prior to handing the keys over - the oil needing a change will not look new - after the oil change, the oil clinging to the dipstick will be lighter, almost "golden clear" in color... prior to the change the oil can range from dirty black to just a medium or light brown - depending on the length between the last change.

Chucky for the boy. Carrie (as in Stephen King) for the girl - but not scary when yelled. . I still freak out every time I hear someone call their kid Malachi (from Children of the Corn) ***goosebumps***. . What about Krueger? Or, Freddie and Krueger?. This would be cool cuz you can shout 'Freddie, Krueger - get back here now!'. . Name on Krueger and one Jason?

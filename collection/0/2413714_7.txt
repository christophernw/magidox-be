If you want to remove something (side of mountain from road, or boulder from mine), you plant explosives to cause the material to move out and away. Can also destroy something from inside out. To implode or destroy something with very little collateral damage, such as exploding a tower without harming the two buildings on either side, you plant explosives to direct the energy inwards. Anyone can explode something to pieces. To implode a large building in a crowded city takes a great deal of talent and experience. This is probably why people like to watch. Also, the chance that something could go wrong makes the experience exciting. Karen

Go to the library, you will not find the Bible listed under fiction. All of your words are pure mockery, carefully chosen by you to make your beliefs sound more superior. Why do you let what Christians, which I am one of , believe bother you so much? Why are you trying so hard to mock and disprove Christianity? The Bible has lasted through all the past generations and will last beyond you. . . " All men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; . the grass withers and the flowers fall, but the Word of the Lord stands forever.". A quote from Isaiah in I Peter 1:24

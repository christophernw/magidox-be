Lava is the expression of the earth's molten rock or magma, generally seeping out of a vent in the earth's surface, perhaps from an active volcano.  It is a liquid, and so flows downhill, cooling as it does very rapidly.  If it doesn't come out of the ground, it might cool more slowly under the capstone, and turn into a crystalline granite or even a gemstone.

Only when you're surrounded by wars and hatred, you will truly appreciate the value of peace, while in a piece time, human doesnt innovate that much, they tend to be stagnant. well, not a pro-war, but world problems exist because they need to... withough cold war, you may never enjoy internet, microwave and so much more...including international trade ( many countries is forced to open their market with military force, not a very good approach however it proven to be somehow a good go, ex:japan)

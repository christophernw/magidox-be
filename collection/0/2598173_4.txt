Everyone will have to know English which will make life easier and less expensive for many government offices and health care offices which according to Federal Law have to provide non-English speaking customers with interpreters to insure proper communication..  I am an immigrant myself and I  think that besides the requirement to learn English, every immigrant who has sufficient mental capacity  should learn English just to show respect to this country for being accepted as residents.. When I was in sports high school, my coach always made sure that when we traveled to different speaking countries we would learn at least to say "Thank you", "You are welcome", "hello" etc. He taught us to  respect host countries.

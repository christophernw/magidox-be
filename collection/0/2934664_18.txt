Some people say the Jesus isn't realistic and yet they desparately go around looking for some supernatural force to control. They say that the Universe just appeared yet they still desparately think of ridiculous theories about it.. . Satan forces people to reject God. But Satan can't do it alone. They have to want to reject God and wander into the darkeness.. . God is the Ultimate being. The Father of creation. He loves us all. Yet we reject Him.. . ("Some of us don't hate ourselves enough to say we are sinners.". It isn't self hate it is just being realistic.)

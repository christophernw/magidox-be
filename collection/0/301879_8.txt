Tofu!!! I actually agree with your post for the first time ever. There is hope that opposing sides can agree on something.. . P.S. It was very interesting to me when I was in  college how little people knew, or even cared about the world around them, and to the point, politics. Engage your friends and family in discussions and you will see what I mean.

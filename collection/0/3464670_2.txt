I have built a few kegerators and found my first refrigerator in the city paper in the classified ads for $50. It needed a new thermostat, so I looked up the part online and bought it for like $15.00 bucks. It was pretty easy to install and the fridge worked great. It was a full size Whirlpool with a freezer on top. ( Good for the frosty mugs ) I bought a kegerator conversion kit form a store called austin homebrew for a little under $200, so it was about a $265 project. I later sold it for $400 to a friend. . . On to kegerator #2..... . Found a refrigerator at a local beer barn that the owner wasnt using. He let it go for only $15 bucks and it had the exact same problem. Thermostat. So, I replaced it again and bough the conversion kit again. I kept this one a few years and eventually sold it on Craigslist.. . Kegerator 3.... . I just got a refrigerator on ebay from a local couple who really didn't know what they had. It was a very cool vintage looking Fridgidaire. I have been looking for one of these for awhile cause I just think they look badass. Kind of like the Craigarators if you have ever seen those online. I am going to have to strip the paint and start from scratch , but it will be worth it. I recently moved and don't have a local homebrew shop, so I did some searching around and found a good resource for kegerator conversion kits and articles about kegerator building.

They are the schematic drawings of buildings, like an architect does.  They are blue because even though the paper starts out white, the process of running them through the old-style copiers turned the paper blue, and left the areas where the ink was white.  The copiers used 100% ammonia, and Jeez did it smell!  (My parents own an architectural firm).  Luckily, up-to-date copiers don't use ammonia, and the paper stays white.

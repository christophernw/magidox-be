Do you attend whatever church you want?  Are you free to choose whether or not you even want to attend a church or believe in God?  Are you allowed to talk about your religion (or lack of) without fear of persecution by the government?  Hmmmmm.  Seems like you have freedom of religion.  We as Americans have no idea what it is like to be oppressed by our government.

Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children and all those who are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.   Acts 2:38-39.. The acceptance of these Scriptures (along with several others) is the beginning of salvation and your personal relationship with Christ.

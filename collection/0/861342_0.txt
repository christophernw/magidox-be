Animal bites are always to be taken seriously. That is because their mouths are full of bacteria and animal bites are almost always going to get infected. Then there's the possibility of rabies as well. If bitten, the person needs to go to the vet to get the wound irrigated and a tetanus shot and antibiotics.. If the animal hasn't been vaccinated for Rabies, then thats another procedure that must be done.. . Don't mess around if you're bitten. It can turn ugly real fast and you don't want to lose your hand or any use of it.

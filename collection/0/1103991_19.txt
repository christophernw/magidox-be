Milton-Bradley's been making 'em for years. You got the spinny wheel and the little tiny cars that you can put six people into, and you choose to go to college or not and then you get a job and you drive around for a while until you ultimately reach the end and die.. Of course, that was just the prototype. Now, you don't die. You just waste a half an hour and yell at your family members for no particular reason. Fun stuff. . So, get a job, get the necessary $29.99 and buy yours today!. *results may vary*

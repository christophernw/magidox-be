Laugh, man. We live in a world where, to paraphrase Bill Hicks, "good men are murdered and mediocrity stalks the planet". Even waking up is a dive into other people's negativity. Find the funny in any situation, and be yourself - just because the negativity is out there, it need not control who you are or how you live your life.

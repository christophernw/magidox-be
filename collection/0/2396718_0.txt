Each of us has a passion about something, and some of us have greater passions than others. When we feel that deeply, it's not hard to notice. This makes it easy for those who like to offend, maybe out of jealousy (they don't have as great a passion), maybe out of just plain spite, who knows. It's not just Christians, it's Muslims, Jews, Atheists (oh yes, they too have a passion, for disproving God), you name it.

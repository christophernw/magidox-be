I really don't know  if they have a soul, but I would like to think that they do. My pets have all had personalities, and seem to have emotions.  This is a great question! I know this is going to sound crazy , but  I had a beloved pet that I was forced to leave behind when I had to move. I had a dream one night, a very vivid dream, that my pet and I were together and were "communicating"... (my pet and I COULD communicate, but in this dream, neither one of us had to "speak" aloud in order to do this).. . I went to visit my pet three days later, and found out from the person taking care of her that she had died mysteriously 3 nights before... I honestly do believe she (or I, or both of us) had  our last "reunion" just  before or just as she passed away-   in that dream. I don't feel like I didn't get to say "good-bye". Something was going on there, more than meets the eye. Does it mean she communicated with me from the "other side"? I don't know. Maybe  our love for one another was the connection that caused some sort of telepathy between us, but if so, does THAT mean she has a soul? If animals and humans can "connect" spiritually,  and I'm now a true believer that they can (I've always suspected that to be true, it's just now I KNOW it is), than don't BOTH have to have souls or "spirits"?  You ask a very interesting question. When or if you finally figure out the "answer", please let me know what you come up with. I'd be interested to hear your perspective. . I desperately want to believe  that someday when I leave this earth I will get to see/be with those I  love who have already "crossed over", including  my pets, and call it "faith" or whatever you want, but I believe.

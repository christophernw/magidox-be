Jesus is real. I have experience it for myself and know that He is real. The altar boy surrender itself to this evil guy who is taking advantage of him and he said nothing. Did Jesus itself have an altar boy when He was on earth? If he didn't have one, why should the priest have one? Get to know your bible and you'll the answer to many of your question.

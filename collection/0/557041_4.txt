You do not need a common denominator to multiply two fractions. . . In essence, you do not even 'need' one to add or subtract them either. We simply find a CD during these manual hand operations to aid the process. By finding a number which is a multiple of both (or more, if more than two fractions are considered) denominators, we have thus found a 'common denominator' which allows us to express both fractions with the same denominator. Hence, we have expressed the operation as something more computationally easier (if doing it by hand). . . For example, it is harder to hand-perform 1/6 + 3/4 than the equivalent 4/24 + 18/24. For the latter, all we need to do is add the numerators to reach the answer; i.e 22/24 ~ 11/12.. . Another example: . Simplify: 1/12 + 1/3. . . Because the denominators are not the same, it is more difficult to hand-compute this question. So we find a common denominator. Easiest method is to of course multiply the denominators, as it is a fact that if c = a x b, where a and b are numbers, then c is an element of the subset of common denominators of those numbers. I.e 12 x 3 = 36 is guaranteed to be a common denominator of 12 and 3.  . We then turn this question into the equivalent 3/36 + 12/36. Now that the denominators are the same, all we have to do is the add the numerators, which is much more computationally (and intuitively) easier. I.e the answer is 15/36.

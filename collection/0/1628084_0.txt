Evolution is a scientific theory, not a religion.  Kids are not taught to embrace athieism or homosexuality.  Schools simply do not allow the discussion of ANY religion.  ALSO...sexuality should be left out of the classroom altogether.  There is not a curriculum that promotes heterosexuality or homosexuality!  Why don't you check the facts before you jump to conclusions...and home school your kids so you can teach them to be God fearing homophobes!

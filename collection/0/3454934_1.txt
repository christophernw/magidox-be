Do NOT TAKE SOMEONE ELSE'S PRESCRIPTION!!!! That is a federal offense. Do, however, continue the vitamin C. And, if your zinc levels are low (you can tell by checking your fingernails for white spots) start to take a zinc supplement as well. . For the sore throat, I eat things that are really sour. It may work for you, it may not. The best thing to do is suck on cough drops, or hard candy (sorry dentists) to keep your throat moist.

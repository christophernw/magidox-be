Princeton has both an undergraduate and graduate program, so technically it's classified as both. So does Harvard. So do most of the major universities.  Sometimes the graduate program is focal point of the school, where most of the resources go to and its prestige is really driven from...sometimes it's the reverse. . . Undergraduate school are those years/degrees that someone gets right out of high school...Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, etc.  Graduate school is what someone attends AFTER they've completed their undergraduate program...for example, if someone wants to get a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) or other advanced degree.

I think you are confusing hate with frustration.  I think the only group that may be "hated" by americans is Al-Queda.  I think that Americans are frustrated and fed up with Palestinians because of 2 things.  First, like most middle easterners.  They blame the Americans for all the world's problems.  Second, because we see that no matter what concessions are made to them, the Palestinians are not going to be satisfied until the state of Israel is gone.  The Palestinian leaders are not interested in compromise.  Only conflict.  And that they use the people only as tools for this goal with no regard for their true well-being and advancement.  The frustration comes in that we see that they are stuck in a sad ring of ignorance and are given no true way out of it by the people that should be looking out for them.

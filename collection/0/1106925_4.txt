Hi charlie,. Check both your Plasma TV and VCR for the video-in/out, audio-in/out puts first.  To record programs in the TV via VCR, first connect the TV antenna to in jacket of your VCR.  The out chord from VCR is to be connected to video the in jacket of your TV.  After making these connections, scan your TV for the correct channel to display with.  It should be either VCH or UTH depending on the TV.  Otherwise it will be Video1 or Video 2 in the TV screen.  Better use double coloured Chords for making the audio/video connections.  Best of luck

There is no known physical effects. However; there is thought to be some chemicals that are released from the brain(endorphines) I think which is a chemical that causes one to be in a more positive mood.However; if one has been sexually active and then is not( do to breaking up with partner/ can't "get any") one may experience the "sexual tension" although does not cause "harm" can makes ones temperment short.(ie. cranky)lol

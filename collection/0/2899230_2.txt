first recomendation is to take a sample of your water from the tank and have a local petstore test your water.   With out testing the water and or a physical description of any growths or spots on the fish itself i will be guessing at the cause....Possible cause #1  more than likely the amount of ammonia/ or nitrates  in the tank has risen to a unsafe level and the tank needs to have a good gravel syphoning and water change.  this will help remove the extra waste and uneaten food that could be rotting in the gravel.. possible cause #2 the other possiblity  is if you recently cleaned the tank and over cleaned it. Although fish will die/get sick from dirty water they also will be affected by a tank that has been cleaned to the point where the beneficial bacteria that lives in your gravel has been destroyed. This bacteria breaks down the goldfishs' waste by turning their ammonia into lesser toxins. Once the bacteria dies it take about a month for it to rebuild. A example of over cleaning would be doing a full water change on a tank, or any cleaning that would envole pulling out the gravel to wash it off.     Possible #3  would be a drastic shift in your waters PH level.  All water has a PH level. And since fish live in water and breathe in water their bodies are designed to be able to internally  shift the PH level to match the water of the tank.They however can only shift two to three points at a time. so in theory if your PH was 7.0 and it drifted down to 6.8 the fish would easily adjust. But if your PH was 7.0 and your PH drifted quickly down to 6.0 Your fish would begin struggling to keep up with the changes, internally his organs will begin to shut down and blood vessels will begin to burst under the shift. This can cause your fish to behave differantly because he is sick/dying.  PH runs from low/ acidic  to a neutral all the way up to alkaline /high.   so average test kit for water will read as follows   6.0 acidic- 6.8--7.0 neutral- 7.8- 8.0 alkaline 8.5         So i definately recommend getting your water tested.

There are several things that affect the cost of any particular fish.. . First is supply and demand. If the demand is higher than the supply, the price goes up.. . Next will be how common it is in the market. People will pay more for something unusual, and the shops know it!. . Most of the real high end fish are ones that don't breed in captivity or hard to breed. These must be imported from their natural waters and imported. This involves a lot of cost. By the time you pay... the guys to catch them, the middle man and the retailer along with shipping, medical, and legal paperwork.. that little guy can be darn right expensive.

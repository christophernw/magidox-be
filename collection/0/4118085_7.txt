You use gravity G-Forces along with braking or hard accelerating to cause the rear wheels break traction and go into a skid, but a controlled skid.  Through practice you learn how to regain the control of your vehicle as not to slide too far.  Many factors play a part from the stickiness of the tires, the suspension, rear or front wheel drive, turning capabilities, engine power, manual or automatic tranny, and more.  You have to know your car and what it takes to break grip of the rear tires and what it takes to regain it as well.  One miscalculation and you've demolished a good car.

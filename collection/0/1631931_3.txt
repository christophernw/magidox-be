Indecision ! . It's infuriating to get so far down the line to have a change of mind which throws everything out of sink.. today is no exception her mind has changed 4 times for reasons best known to her, only to revert to the original decision with variations and then attempt to change it again, at this point I put my foot down or leave and tell her to do it without me. ENOUGH!

Your 15 million figure is not only inaccurate but inflammatory.  If it was 1, that was too many so there is no need to make it appear any worse than it was.  . . Since you want to hold slaves up as the poster children for suffering, I think it befitting you mention all the other countries which have had citizen who were slaves.. . It's a long list as it is virtually every country on the planet.. . While you're playing the "wow is me card", you might also want to ask why your own people were the ones who were selling you into slavery.  In pretty much every other instance, slaves where the byproduct of lost battles and wars.. . And lastly, if it had not been for the practice of slavery, people who were intended to be salves would have certainly been killed.  That doesn't make it right, but it sure beats the alternative.

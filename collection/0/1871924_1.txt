In Arizona I pay the state $20 and register the business name at the Commerce Building downtown. It's called a fictitious name filing. You can also do this online in most states. You'll fill out a form with the company name, ownerâ€™s names and addresses. The State computer will check to see if the business name is available. It's pretty easy, huh? http://www.allbusiness.com/research/business_licenses.asp. . Even easier is to get your business a website so people in your area can find you and hire your services online. I will be very happy to help you get your online business up and running, making you money. My contact information is in the source link below.

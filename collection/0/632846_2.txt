Why do you think oppressive governments try to curtail free speech?  They KNOW how important it is.  Goodness, if you let everybody read and write and say anything they want, they might start THINKING and having their own ideas and start causing TROUBLE!  Much better to put a stop to that - and then no one will know how corrupt your government really is.. . It can be argued that the American Revolution would have never happened if people like Thomas Paine hadn't started it.  His little pamphlet, "Common Sense," stirred up all kinds of trouble for the British government.  Revolutions often finish with swords - but most of them get started with pens and tongues.. . The written word is powerful.

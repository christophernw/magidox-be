There are a couple things you can do, you can take an internship with someone in the area you are interested in; offer to work for a period of time at no charge to them for the experience of establishing a work record you could then use for an application.. . The other thing, you could ask the potential employer if they could give you an opportunity to prove yourself, that you are just coming out of college with no current work experience; you could offer to work for them for a given amount of time at no charge and if all is satisfactory, you would be accepted for employment.. . Just thinking outside the box; what an exciting time for you, good luck!  This is where all that work and sacrifice will finally come into play...

One of my cats does exactly the same thing, when shes thirsty she miaows and leads me to the taps. she sits while i have a bath or shower ands as soon as I'm finished she jumps in and wants a drink. Although i know that there is always clean water around for her to drink both in a cat bowl and a dog bowl, she is a peculiar creature and i find her tendencies rather amusing. So i say as long as there are other sources of refreshment available she will find them and not to worry.

Basically you have to buy out your partner's share.  The partnership agreement probably spells out how this is to be done.. . If you do not have a written partnership agreement, at least put the dissolution of the partnership in writing, in the form of a contract you both sign, and have it notarized.  Then it either [former] partners' heirs have a question about the assets of the partnership, you will have it all in writing.

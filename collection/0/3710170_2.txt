It's just like any "curse" word: the seemingly inherent shock value. We're taught/brainwashed into believing certain words either hold power or are just "filthy," so there's an attraction to using such words when we're angry or experiencing some other emotional extreme. I think in such times there's a subconscious recognition that we need an immediate outlet, and use of those words sometimes lifts the burden.. . Rhetorical question: What outlets would we have if the words didn't have that effect?

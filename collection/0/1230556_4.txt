A CAT scan or CT SCAN can be done to scan the head. Other than a CAT scan, the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can also be used. It is safer than the head scan. No radiation exposure with MRI. Ultrasound scan can also be used to look at parts of the head e.g the eye socket, sinuses, and the anterior fontanelle in a baby. (fontanelle is the skin-covered opening in babies heads in the front that is soft and can be depressed).

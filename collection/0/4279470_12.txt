Actually did you know most stomach flu and bugs are actually caused by eating contaminated foods?  But anyhow, you gotta regulate your BM's.  Eat fibrous foods, crackers will help firm up the stools but you don't want to go too far and be constipated.  Eat crackers and soups, breads for a day, then start back in a normal diet but add some fruits and make sure you drink alot of water to push things through.  For the cramps, try a moist hot pack.

Well even though I beleive that thieves are major SCUM! I will answer this question for entertainment purposes only. Considering the technology that is prevalent today the chances are that you will get caught eventually, but that is because mathamatically the more jobs you do the more likely you will screw up and get caught  :(. . So not getting caught is the first most important step to becoming a great theive or cat burglar...whatever...this goes througout the whole process of planning and executing.. . Planning: You must plan to the millisecond. You will not be successful if you don't make a great plan. Keep in mind that planning includes all the research needed to learn hardware and software of security systems, and how to manipulate them to your advantage. Planning may take many months..but in the end you will thank yourself when you take off with a big score. . . Executing: This is the part that takes major balls ( I wouldn't know from experience because I'm ofcource not a complete idiot that would ever steal from anyone...but if you watch a couple of heist movies like HEAT you can understand the amount of stress that can happen when trying to take a score....ofcource working alone is the best bet to insure against mission security leaks....anyways I'm done answering this question because if you really do wanna steal from somebody, then you should be sitting on a concrete floor while  your cell mate BUHBUH gives you a nice back rub..............................

someone who knows what's normal in a child at a certain age or stage in their development is more likely to see what's missing or wrong with a child early enough for the problem to be treated to the best effect.  I'd give anything for someone who knew what Asperger's Syndrom was and looked like to have been able to see my son when he was younger--may have saved us all precious time and heartache in getting him the treatment and training he needs to continue to be successful.

Mystery snails have a trap door that they pull over themselves when they go into their shells.  If it is closed it is likely it's still alive.  Try to take it out of the tank if it's dead it will fall out of it's shell.  I have 4 black and 1 gold mystery (apple)snails and they usually only move around at night.

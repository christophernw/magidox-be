Government bonds are about as close to risk-free as any investment class.  All other investments would stop paying returns before the US Government defaulted on its obligations.   This default-free status makes them very safe.  (Unlike many "double-your-money" schemes). . Most people, therefore, buy government bonds because they want a nice safe investment that is very liquid and they know it will cover expenses in the near horizon (e.g. new house or retirement).  They can rest easy at night knowing that these needs will be provided for.. . Others buy/trade risky corporate bonds for a different reason.  Corporate bonds (not bond funds) are a hedge against the equity markets.  When investors get spooked they typically pull money out of equity markets and put it into bond markets.  This tends to reduce the YIELD in the bond market, but increases the PRICE that investors are willing to pay for a bond that reaches expiration in 5 years.  . . Imagine you bought a zero-coupon bond for $800 and the bond is worth $1000 at maturity you would have a yield of slightly under 5% if you held this to maturity.  However, if suddenly the stock market tanked and everyone was rushing to buy bonds instead, they may bid up the price of the security you bought to $900.  You could then either elect to keep the bond to maturity or sell it for an immediate $100 profit.  . . Unlike equity, there is no risk to the principal in bonds (your $800 is secure), but there is upside if the price of the underlying security goes up.  Or downside if you consider the opportunity cost of having locked money up in a 5-year investment

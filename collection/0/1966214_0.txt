Actually,you can go from ipod to computer...it just takes a little hacker action (dont worry, its legal) its actually kind easy...just enable for disk use, and follow the steps for moving music to a new computer (one thats not linked to your ipod) find out how here: http://www.info.apple.com/kbmun/n300173 or just type in: "moving music to a new computer" on the apple support page for ipod...

El was the name for the father of Gods. Baal of the mountains was his son who resembles the Norse God Thor. El himself is more like Zeus. The form of the word as Elohim is the Hebrew plural meaning gods and refers to El's children( Baal, Ishtar, etc.)  more than to El himself. This root word El is not Phoenician, they came much later and from a different part of the world. El is from the ancient Mesopotamian cultures in what is now Iraq/Iran. The most complete versions of the story however come from sites in Jordan.. The Hebrew texts translate El as God and use it as the ending on names in the form you write as "iel" meaning "of god" so that a name like Ezeke would come out as Ezekiel, or the name Dan (meaning judge) would become Daniel (meaning Judge of/by God). It has nothing to do with a lunar Deity, in spite of what bible believers claims.. . here is from columbia university press:  Encyclopedia . Directory > Reference > Encyclopedia Allah (ăl'ə, ä'lə) , [Arab.,=the God]. Derived from an old Semitic root refering to the Divine and used in the Canaanite El, the Mesopotamian ilu, and the biblical Elohim, the word Allah is used by all Arabic-speaking Muslims, Christians, Jews, and others. Allah, as a deity, was probably known in pre-Islamic Arabia. Arabic chronicles suggest a pre-Islamic recognition of Allah as a supreme God, with the three goddesses al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat as his “daughters.” The Prophet Muhammad, declaring Allah the God of Abraham, demanded a return to a strict monotheism. Islam supplements Allah as the name of God with the 99 most beautiful names (asma Allah al-husna), understood as nondescriptive mnemonic guides to the Divine attributes.. Bibliography. . See S.

The 3 officers were wounded and survived. The 92 y/o grandmother is dead. Typical result of a shootout with the police. Mistaken identity? Probably not. Unfortunately, the details of the warrant were not publicized. I'd put money that it was the children and grandchildren living at the address that were selling drugs.

As it is in the natural, so it is in the spiritual. Just like in the natural world moths are drawn to a flame, so are atheists drawn to the light of Christ. They flutter around the edges of it like a moth that keeps banging it's head into a light bulb that's on in the dark. They know that there's something wonderful and desirable there but they just can't comprehend it.

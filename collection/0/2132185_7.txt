i do that with my teenie dogs. My dog goes everywhere that I go. Do you know that in England people can take a Cavalier king Charles Spaniel anywhere? Even to theaters and eateries. Because King Charles declared it a law! I have 2 children and have raised 23 foster children, so it isn't wishing for babies. I just like to share life with my little dog.

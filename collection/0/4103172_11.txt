I was in a very bad situation. I didn't have a steady home to live in, I was bouncing around from friends to friends, I had no parental guidance, no money, then I got pregnant at the beginning of the school year. I know this all sounds like a big fat excuse, & I"m not one for excuses. I went on to be the first person in my family to ever attend college. I have a better job than either of my parents ever had & I'm a great mother. I would never promote my children to 'drop' out of school. But I can't say that I completely regret it, b/c I wouldn't be where i am today...

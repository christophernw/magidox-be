They are exposed onto film for high quality and are usually exposed at 24 frames per second to create a seamless motion.. the frames are exposed by the light coming through the lens, the shutter then opens and exposes the film to light for a fraction of a second and is then taken back into the storage area [ called the magazine] and is then taken to be processed and then scanned in to a digital database.. .  sorry the shutter on a motion picture camera is a spinning mirror that exposes light on the film for 1/24 of a second.. and it isnt always scanned in.

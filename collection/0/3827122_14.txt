Simply Stated...you don't know a flying f*&k what you are talking about....most of the Bible is metaphorical, filled with parables, and not meant to be taken literally.  The Bible is taken litererally contradicts itself many many times.  You should grow up and realize the Bible was written by men!  The final thing I have to say to you is that if Jesus was around today HE would be considered a liberal and a revolutionary...he would not be considered a conservative by any sense of the imagination.  You are looking at the present through the eyes of the past and getting a totally distorted picture of it!

We disregard the rest of the world's opinions when making decisions with international implications.  We invade countries when the rest of the world thinks we shouldn't, we pull out of international environmental treaties, we send controversial and undiplomatic representatives to the United Nations and publicly bash the UN, and the entire time we act very self-righteous about our actions.. . This is all the fault of President Bush and his administration.  He is one of the worst foreign policy leaders ever.

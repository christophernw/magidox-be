Have you considered that your sins were becoming petty, boring and bothersome?  Why should I indulge minor transgressions and tempt you with repentance, when I can wear you down over time until you suddenly find yourself inescapably wallowing in blissful torment and misery.  Hmmm... I think I smell something burning... gotta run.

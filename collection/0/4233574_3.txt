because dinosaurs the word is a fairly new word. behemoth and Leviathan are mentioned in the bible and at least by their description seem to fit into the category of "dinosaur". See Job 40:15-24,Job 41, Psalm 104:25,26 and Isaiah 27:1 for more on animals that would appear to be dinosaurs in the bible.

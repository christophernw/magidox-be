because the air causes their stomach muscle (i don't know the word in English) to be excited...so the muscle will contract rapidly, causing the air to go out quickly, with a sound...To end it, you must take a deep breath and hold your respiration for about one minute...keep the air in...this will relax the muscle and will cause you to stop the hiccups. when you let the air out, let it out easily, not quickly.

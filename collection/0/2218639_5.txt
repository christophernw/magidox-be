The patriots have rejected the bush agenda for many reasons.  Iraq, civil rights, the deficits, and the stubbornness of Bush & Cheney.  Although I do not often agree with Republicans, they are not weak on defense, they were loyal to the wrong man this time.  With The Army Times, Navy Times, etc. and many decorated Generals speaking out that Bush has grossly  mismanaged this war, it is clear that, for whatever reason, Bush  has picked the wrong war, managed it badly, and failed to listen to advice.  We now find ourselves in a terrible mess.  It doesn't help to gloat to Republicans - there  has been far too much of that and it only serves to legitimise the behavior.  We need to realize we are stronger if all of us are heard and can contribute to the fnal decisions.  Republicans made us weaker by not doing that.  Let us show them that we can do better and take advantage of their wisdom to get us all out of the mess that Bush got us into.  Thank God the people's voice has been heard.

The AKC doesn't register mixed breeds.  There are some other mixed breed registries around.  I hope you have plans for how you are going to find GOOD homes for these puppies.  You brought them into this world and you are responsible for their welfare.  A reputable breeder is interested in their puppies for life not just until the check clears.

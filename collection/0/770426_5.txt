Soap is not a good lubricant for any part of the body. It is designed to break down dirt and oils and could cause irritation when used on skin as a lubricant for massage or other activities. In fact some soaps with scents or deodorants have been known to cause some pretty nasty reactions on some penises and other parts.. . If you want to lube up for self pleasure, then almost anything slippery will do. You can buy a commercial lubricant or even raid the kitchen cupboard and use vegetable oil.  . . However,if engaging in sexual activity where latex is involved, you are going to require a water based product so pop in to your local pharmacy or sex shop and buy some water based lube in the flavour and colour of your choosing. . . Alterantively, you could order such products by mail order or online shopping if you have a credit card. Though if you are too young for a credit card, you may be too young for doing that anal stuff (unless it's just self-exploration in which case mom's vegetable oil will work fine). Oh, and it may be fine to use mom's vegetable oil but not her credit card; they ship only to the person named on the card...

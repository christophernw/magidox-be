Kitty burrito? Okay, get a sweater, or a fleece pullover, and put the cat in the sleeve with one paw exposed. Clip a nail and give the cat a treat. tell him/her they are a good kitty. Use soothing tones and don't lose your patience, cats can sense when you are anxious. If you start to lose your cool, stop and try again later when you are both more calm.  Patience and lots of cat treats will prevail,,,

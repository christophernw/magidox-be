If you're talking about rocks, it means that the rocks can deform plasticly over long periods of times.  That is to say the rock can move and bend without breaking.  This is as opposed to "brittle" behaviour, where the rocks would simply break.  Whether or not a rock behaves brittly or ductily depends on a number of things: the pressure the rocks are at (how deep they are in the crust), how hot the rocks are, and how quickly the force is applied to the rock (the strain rate).  If you apply a force to a rock over a long time scale under appropriate conditions, it will bend ductily.  If however you apply the force suddenly, or under a shorter time span, the rock will fail brittly.. . Hope that helps :)

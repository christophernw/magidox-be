Actually no, that is not normal.  I would go to the doctor and have him check your blood sugar level.  Extreme thirst after heavy glucose can indicate low insulin levels and possible hyperglycemia.(Diabetes)  But don't panic, I could be wrong because there can be several other stupid simple reasons, but that is the first I would check for.

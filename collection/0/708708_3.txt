Am sure some folks at that time must have tried it ...might be the reason too it got extinguished .... What it tasted like ?? My guess only...probably been used as a sleeping  aid  in some kind of tartare sauce !:-). . Wonder if some folks actually ate some "real" hot dogs - 90%  sure about this one - before the rubbish we now have today..:-)

Assuming your wife has passed on ...I think in reality it is your subconscious. You are more than likely missing her or certain things she used to do. Some would say that it is her way of communicating with you...if you believe in the issues of speaking from the beyond. It all depends on what your beliefs are and if you chose the scientific approach or the spiritual approach.

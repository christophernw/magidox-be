I've never had an abortion or even been pregnant but, I think most women abort their child because they don't want the baby. They're afraid to what would happen if one of their loved ones found out if they were pregnant. So, they do the only thing they think they can do. But, it's not the only thing they can do. I'm pro-choice but more leaning towards anti-abortion.

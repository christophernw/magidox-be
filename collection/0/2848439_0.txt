No one has a finite answer to that although the most popular idea is that gravity creates a bend in space-time.. . Think of space-time as a flat surface, and a planet sits in the middle and causes a dent in it. Surrounding the planet there will be a slight curve, anything inside the curve is in that planet's gravitational field.. . In any case, any mass feels the forces of gravity (and causes it at the same time).

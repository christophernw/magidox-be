Go to Fitz's Rootbeer in University City in St. Louis.  Watch the most creamy rootbeer in the world being bottled.  Grab a table.  Sit down order a great big rootbeer float. It will come in a big frosty mug with lots of ice cream.  The rootbeer is ever flowing so if you get to the bottom of the mug and still have ice cream left don't worry, more rootbeer is on the way.

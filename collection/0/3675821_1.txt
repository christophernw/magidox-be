It's called Representative Democracy. I don't have time to deal with every little nit-picky detail about how the government works, so I pick somebody to do it for me. Just like how we don't all try to put out our own fires or catch our own criminals. It's just that most other types of professional public servants are required to be at least a little bit competent at what they do.

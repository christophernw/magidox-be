The best advice I can give on this subject with out looking at the vehicle itself is to go to your nearest auto parts store and buy a repair book on your Isuzu.  In the chapters it should have to explain how to remove the water pump and replace it as well too.  Usually Chilton are the books to get, but they do offer other books on it.  Best of all it shows you pictures of the engine itself as well as the part you are removing.

LOTS of exercise!!!  To work on your arms you should start lifting weights.  There are a few different ways/exercises to do in order to tone your arms.  As far as start as weight is concerned...start low (whatever you can life easily with out getting too tired too soon).  Don't forget to work on all areas of the arms, like underneath, because it won't look the same and it defeats the whole purpose!  Tae Bo really works great too!

excellent question. but honestly one (or you in this case) should write direct to the TV. or radio stations -- to stop doing this non-sense.i have been thinking also about it but "no action" sorry. it takes time to find their e-mail and the correct person to pass the message that we (i.e.the public) do not care one iota whether or not the weather was OK. yesterday or last year or prior years, what we want to know is to-day. voila...hope you pass the message on. the more the merrier.

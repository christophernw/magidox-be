Reality is.  It just is.  I cannot be changed, nor can it be tweeked.  That being said, one's perception of the reality they're in can be altered in various ways:  . . First there's the glass half full /half empty school of thought.. . Then, there's the thinking that everything one does affects out next move...but that changes the future's reality.. . Finally, there's acid, PCP, Magic Mushrooms and other hallucenogenics (SP?).  But I've come a long way to do any of that now.. . I need an aspirin...got a headace from all this thinking.. :)

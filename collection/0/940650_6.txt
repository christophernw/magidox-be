I believe in creation. . Why would every man that said he saw Jesus after He rose from the dead be put to a horrible death, when they could have saved themselves by saying it wasn't true?  Jesus ate with his deciples after He rose from the dead to prove He was alive, because ghosts can't eat!. . evolution? no way.

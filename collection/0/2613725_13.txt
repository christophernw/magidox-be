He wants us to have faith in him.That means to believe in him with out having to see him.He did send himself as Jesus here on earth from what the bible says and taught everything to man then.Now Jesus died on the cross as a man like in person for all our sins.The only way to heaven is through him it's our choice on believing or not.

Ohhhh...this is a good one. This has been the question that man has been asking since the beginning. I would define existing as getting by, day to day, with no hope, purpose or future. You're here, you're aware of yourself, you're aware of and long for something more than you are....which leads to the question..."Is there a God?" I believe there is. Seek and ye shall find. Seek and ye shall more than exist.

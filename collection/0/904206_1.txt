In a small scale infection there are many ways to help, putting peroxide or iodine in the wound will help (although both sting really bad, but it works!) and then a band-aid with neosporin on the wound after helps it to heal and stay clean.  If it is a bad wound, or getting out of control you really should check with a doctor as well, they can help fix it if it's bad, or in the least, give you some anti-biotics.

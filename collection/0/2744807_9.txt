Well, a nice question. You want proof, then I am the proof. When I was 13-14 years I knew Him(that does not mean a vision or something) it's just I felt Him controlling my life. My life has been totally changed eversince..  Note: I'm a teenager and I'm not good or holy or anything. It's just a frank statement. Don't care much about athiests and don't deceive yourself by trying to proove Christ did not exist. Follow your heart.

God gave us and earth to live in and he gave us bodies and gave us women and all things good and bad in the world... and he gave us a free will to do what we want. We can have sex or just hold hands or we can decide to be gay... We can eat food and take showers and ride bikes... All the things in the world that bring pleasure like marijuana plants and chocolate and MTV pimp my ride were created by God in the beginning so that we could have fun, do cool stuff, have children, get sick, and die. Technically he probably wants for us to have morals and be good people while we are on Earth because all the great things that mankind has done/will do only seek to give him greater glory and he will reward us at the day of judgement with life next to him in paradise forever.. . So in short, we are here to party. We shouldn't worship God because we don't want to go to hell... we should worship him because HE EFFIN MADE US!

I hate people who are proud of something they never accomplished.  you were born white, or caucasian, or whatever, so why be proud?  you didn't do anything to be proud of.  you didn't overcome any tragedy to deserve pride.  racial pride is the fundamental element in racism, something that all races share.  instead of being proud of where your ancestors come from, why not realize that all races are elementally the same?  when was the last time you visited the caucus mountains?  do you have a country home in the motherland?  interesting that you would mention africa, being an entire continent, and then a mountain for your own origin.  would you not just be asian?  there you go, you're asian.  now you can have asian pride.  but in the mean time, why don't you go save a whale or eliminate poverty in africa and then you will have something to be proud of.

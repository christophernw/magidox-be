I have seen a big change more and more to horrific news stories shown graphically over and over again.  . I agree with your asking this question...some is truly it being out there.  . Some I believe that the news media THINKS this is what "responsible journalism" is these days and that's not true!. I have started to boycott some news stations and even have written afew times to request they not force people to watch such graphic violence without choice or warnings!. Maybe you could write to your local stations and say-stop it!. I also think it is part of a bigger problem of SENSATIONALISM of over the top coverage.  Look at star coverage and paparazzi!  I have stopped watching the late night news before bed because I was having nightmares and trouble falling asleep.. Last night they kept showing a story about a hit and run death of a mother of 11 children-end of story...I do not think that is responsible journalism at all.  . No, I don't want to be told all ends well, but I do want to know-what was the community response to this event and any way a community can help these 11 children as an example.. Also, no follow up on horrific stories of coping and helping.  I heard over and over an upcoming headline of 2 teen boys and a homemade bomb in a Walmart!!!  What are we to do with a story like that?  Be afraid to go Christmas shopping at Walmarts?  . . YOUR QUESTION IS SO GOOD AND WE CAN CHANGE IT!

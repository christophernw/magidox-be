Some of the Greek myths are: (1) The man who rolls a great rock to the top of a hill, and when he reaches the top after great effort, the rock rolls back to the bottom again, and the events repeat themselves endlessly. (2) The dragon that has many heads breathing fire, and when one head is chopped off, it grows back again. (3) The fighting hero, whose only vulverability is his heel, which kills him when penetrated by an arrow. (4) The king who has the ability to turn everything he touches into gold.

Like most things that float, ice floats because it is less dense than liquid water. Ice is about 9% less dense. When ice forms, it takes up about 9% more space than it did as a liquid. Thus, a 1 liter container of ice weighs less than a 1 liter container of liquid water, and the lighter material floats to the top. It is according to the rules of physics.. By the laws of . . By the way, it is due to the difference in Hydrogen Bonding between water and ice..

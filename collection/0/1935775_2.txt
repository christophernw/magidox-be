Think about it like this . . . .. . Imagine yourself in a room with another person, the room measuring about 5'x5'x8', just as an example.  Let's say that this other person in the room farts.  You two are on opposite ends of the room . . . what happens? Eventually, you will smell the fart. This is because there is a constant need by nature, materials, elements, etc., to be in equilibrium. If you apply this reasoning to space compared to a space ship, for example, you get something called a vacuum . . . .. . This spaceship is going to be filled with an atmosphere that is close to the 14lbs./in^2 that human beings require to match that on earth. So when something like a micrometeorite punctures the hull of that spacecraft, the atmosphere within the craft is going to want to equalize the pressure, or distribution, outside the craft, just like the case of the fart in the room. The only difference is the extreme pressure gradient between the spacecraft and space that generates a violent sucking of air out into space, a vacuum in otherwards.  The vacuum is only relative; if a person is at 0lbs/in^2, then there would be no vacuum, everything would be equalized, so to speak.. . So the vacuum effect only exists because human beings, when traveling in space, need to maintain an atmospheric pressure that, when freed, will violently equalize, resembling a 'vacuum' effect, relatively.

Because that's the flavor of the month right now for ignorant rednecks. Don't take it personally, just tell yourself that they're a bunch of tards. . . Early 90's, I went to Tennessee for a couple weeks. Everyone there thought I was Puerto Rican or "something"- as they said. Ha- I'm just a native Floridian with a good tan. . . Bottom line- People are idiots. Hell with 'em.

allow your husband to fufill his obligation without your value judgement of "being taken advantage of".  your point of view is the wrench in the system. not trying to be unkind, and do feel empathy for you. but allow him to do what he feels he needs to and allow her to ask until she feels she doesn't have to anymore.  you can't rush the process and will only alienate your husband in the process. tell him you love him and you trust his judgement in this and you will say nothing again on this matter unless asked.  not what you wanted to hear probably but hope it works out for you!

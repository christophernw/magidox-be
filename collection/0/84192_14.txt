It always seems to be this way. A piece of paper is more valuable than experience. It is sad. And in my opinion looses some companies lots of money. Just because they went to school and got that degree does not mean that they are more qualified than someone who has been doing it for 4 years. And it seems sad to me that the person who has been doing the work for 4 years seems like a nobody just because he doesn't have that piece of paper(degree).  They are just as valuable, if not more. I don't understand this either.

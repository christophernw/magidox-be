I agree with the first person.. . When the lights are on, but not the engine, the lights are running off of the Direct Current (DC) from the car battery. When you turn the ignition, the starter does draw on the battery power to turn the engine over. Once the engine starts going, The Alternator turns the DC power of the car battery into Alternaiting Current (AC) power. This keeps you from draining the battery dry, since an AC power source is self charaging for all intents and pourposes.. . Got to remember that the big ol battery in the car is only a 12-volt battery, like in a radio....just bigger and last a whole lot longer.

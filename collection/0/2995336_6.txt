I met Khleo Thomas(Zero from Holes and Mike from Roll Bounce) at my 8th grade graduation party at Dave&Busters downtown. (I'm from Chicago) It was about two and a half years ago.  He and the other boys from the movie were filming Roll Bounce and decided to stop by. Before me and my family left I finally got up the courage to go up and say hi.  I shook his hand and he complimented me and my little sister(who had dragged me to say hello to him) and said we looked like twins. (She's 17 months younger than me and 2 inches taller) He was really nice.. If only I had remembered to ask for his AUTOGRAPH!!!

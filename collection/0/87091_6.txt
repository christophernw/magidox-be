Hi Jay,  Sounds like she doesn't know her job,and is hidding behind you and using you. Just go up to her and tell her,your not going to do her work anymore. If that don't work go over her head and report her. Why should you have to help her!! Your not getting paid extra.You have to worry about yourself not others. A Friend.. .     Clowmy

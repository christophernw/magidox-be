Fasting causes the body to undergo several changes. First, you begin to detox. Second, not eating will cause your blood sugar to drop. This can cause health concerns. Too low & you can have health problems. That's why it's best to either fast with a doctor's approval to avoid it if you've got Diabetes or hypoglycemia. After about 3 days, the hunger pangs stop. This is generally when the greatest sense of clarity & concentration enter into the fast.

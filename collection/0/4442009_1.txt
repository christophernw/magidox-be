The discovery method requires the teacher to do a lot of work that guides the students to asking the right questions.  The theory is that once the student has found the question the answers are retained in the memory with a foundation that promotes usable knowledge rather than loose bits of information.  It seems to work better in theory than in application when used in all but the smallest of groups- 3 students at most for primary grades.  It is also the method used in the study of Law but that's different.

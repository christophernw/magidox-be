I am learning Japanese.  It's not nearly as hard as Chinese.  There are several tribal languages which are very difficult for anthropologists to understand.  But the most widespread would be Mandarin Chinese (also the world's most popular language) because of its complex symbols being the sole foundation.  Japanese actually has a sort-of alphabet which makes it easier to learn.  English is hard, but not as hard as Chinese (has the tonal language)

If you have your neighbor's cat neutered or put down, you open yourself to legal repercussions. If an animal owner doesn't believe in spay/neuter, they most likely won't care about you or your house. There are products available to repel cats and dogs, granules you can scatter around your foundation to create a "no go" border, just like staying out of the garden stuff. Also available are sprays that make areas unappealing. Try websites like petco.com or gardener's supply. Also a trip to Home Depot's garden shop will provide the granules. You will have to reapply to break the cat of this habit, since your house now has his scent and he considers it his territory. Anything is better than a war with your neighbor, which can make life more miserable than cat pee.

Follow the barometer and the jet stream. That will tell you everything you need to know to predict the weather. The drop of the barometer is low pressure, an indication of humidity and that rain is coming (asthmatics dread the drop because at this point we can't breathe). Then check the jet stream and that will tell you where it will hit or get swept away.

I don't know about other Christian religions, but Catholicism holds that humans are formed "in the image and likeness of God."  Humans are "above all other animals, just below the angels."  Also, the soul and the body are two separate entities.. . Whereas the body is formed by your mother of what she eats for nourishment (ie the circle of life... feel free to sing!), the soul is formed by God and endowed upon your conception.  After death, your soul is whisked away, whereas your body reenters the energy cycle.. . Furthermore, He who creates the laws of physics really doesn't have to obey them, does He? :D

They are benefits because the employer gets "bulk pricing" because he is buying insurance for all his employees.. . Look into your plans. For example if you pay $100 your employer pays $200 for insurance for a total of $300 a month. The same coverage may cost you $500 a month if you tried to get it yourself. . . So if you got your higher wage (+$200) you would actually make less because you would pay an extra $200 for insurance

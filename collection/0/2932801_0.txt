Most authors have tons of story ideas in their heads and aren't looking for someone else's ideas.  If you have a good idea for a book write it yourself.  . . Then once you have finished it, you can submit it to agents and editors.  (The only genre where you don't have to have a 100% completed draft to submit is non-fiction, but it is still a good idea to have a large portion of it done.). . Good luck and happy writing!

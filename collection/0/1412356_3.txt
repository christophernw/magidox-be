Shih Tzus are lower intelligence than some other breeds of dogs and often people have more problems house training them - be consistent - go out wiht the dog ALL the time - reward it instantly with soft treat.  (sending pup out by itself and rewarding when it comes in is biggest mistake most people do because the dog thinks coming in is why it gets the treat). do not paper train them - this only confuses them why it is ok to go inside sometimes but then not other times.  I suggest crate training for potty training.

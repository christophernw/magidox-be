Science is not about having 100% of the answers. It's about having the best answer to fit the evidence, and it's about continuing to look for answers.. . There are, however, more alternatives than those two. Aliens, for example... or those who are on acid and think we are all just an elaborate dream in the mind of some other being... there are as many alternatives as an imagination will allow. Likelihood is an important consideration, though.

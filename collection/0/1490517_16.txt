Faith makes sense if you support it with a logical frame of mind, and that only works if youve got a faith you can bring your head and heart into.. . But some things you cannot reason with. . . Practices should be sensible, but Im not obliged to answer up to the whys and hows of what God orders. . . To me its like saying: lying is wrong: but why???. . get it? . . Some things are evident if u look closely...other things...just takes time to understand between cultures and time frames....overall...people need to have strong faith, that means both head and heart.. . Peace out

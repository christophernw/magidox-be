It's NOT a scam. It's not the cheapest option yet, but people who can afford to should switch because it will eventually lessen our dependence on foreign oil, not to mention being much better for the atmosphere. Also, oil is not a renewable energy source, one day it will run out and the alternative energy source will be the only energy source.

I glaze over when I read the KJV...in that sense I'm no further ahead even if it is more accurate.. . The idea that the King James is closest to God's word is an old idea.   It probably was when it was first translated, but much hard work in translation has been done since then.  Try the New International Version or New American Standard Bible if you are concerned with accuracy but want an easier read.

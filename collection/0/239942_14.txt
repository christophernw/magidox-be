I liked one of the other respondents' answers a la Douglas Adams - "42" - but it's only a spoof on the usual kind of answer.  D.A. couldn't help himself from uttering such things to raise a jolly good laugh from time to time, and he was very inventive at it.  . . But the more common kind of answer of the philosophers doesn't usually get much closer than Douglas Adams.  My old prof at Uni (where I actually did a philosophy degree) wrote a book called "Philosophy And The Meaning Of Life".  But his "answer" was no clearer at the end of the book than it was at the beginning.  (His name was Karl Britton.). . In one of my earlier replies today I mentioned Jean-Paul Sartre, who I think got close to outlining the sort of "program for a life" that one would have to adopt if one was a dyed-in-the-wool atheist (as he was, and I am).. . In a world where there's no God, it's not the case that "anything is possible", but rather that, from motives of common decency and humanity, you have to do as much as you can to assist those around you who need extra help to counteract the bad things that may be happening to them.  And we live in a world now where some very bad things indeed are happening to countless numbers of people.  . . Adopting the Sartrean (or Kantian) outlook towards one's fellows in a world without God, and where the only sanction comes from within oneself, is a much more "heroic" way of proceeding than would be the case for someone who has all the moral props of a religious belief.

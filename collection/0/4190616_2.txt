Time my friend! Nothing happens over night... How you eat today will have a greater effect on your body over the next 5 years than tomorrow or next month. . . And you dont need to pump iron or do cardio every day.. In fact you shouldn't! Give your body a break. Your joints and muscles and heart will thank you... Change your lifestyle don't bust your butt for a month or two and not see any change and then go back to burgers and such...

Let me tell you a story of the time God spoke to my heart in that still small voice to give a tract to this woman. We was standing in line at a store and this woman in front of me was dressed like a hooker, and I mean showing her butt and all. Well God spoke to my heart and said give her a tract and my first responce was she will throw it away Lord. So still in disbelief I gave her the tract and got back in line. I thought to myself I will find it laying outside on the floor or in the trash. Well let me tell you how God works. Normally that trash can is so ful that you wouldn't be able to tell what was throwed away, but this time it was empty. Well I walked outside thinking I would find it on the ground and I didnt and then I looked in the trash can it there was nothing in there. Then that still small voice came back and said Oh ye of little faith. That girl kept that gospel tract. I just hoped after that, that even though my faith was lacking, that God spoke to her heart.. . I have heard of many people who was saved cause someone left them a tract on their car or handed them one. So yes they are effective.

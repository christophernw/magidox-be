In addition to what was said above, if your camera is equipped with IR lights, then night mode would actually translate to infrared mode, because you are viewing the infrared spectrum (which has no colors except for green). This technology is a toned-down version of the high-powered IR beams used in the military. If your camera does not have IR lights then all it does is amplify the brighter areas of your focus, sacrificing depth and color clarity to make objects more visible.

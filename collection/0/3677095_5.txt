Adaptation/evolution is something that takes an extremely long time.  So 1.  It is possible that there is life on Mars or any other planet; however, they have not had time to evolve into something other than say bacteria, single celled organisms, etc.  2.  There must be something which starts life, ie: lightening and a pool of elements, etc.  If those two criteria are met (2 before 1), then life will adapt ANYWHERE.

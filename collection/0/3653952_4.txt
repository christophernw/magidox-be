I think most of us tend to react negatively to that flag as well as to  many other symbolic things that we have come to associate with  bad things like a burning cross , a Nazi  symbol...etc.... and no matter how they defend using it   ( some say its just honoring their dead confederate soldiers etc.) you just can't help but feel that person  wishes the south had won and they wish it will rise again...so yep.... its still scary!

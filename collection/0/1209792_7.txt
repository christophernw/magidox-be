heat your pan on high with grease melting. make sure your chicken is throughly washed and all the fat is gone. Well all the fat that is on the sides of the chicken that will cook off while frying. Make a batter of flour, seasoning salt, and chicken seasoning if your desire. Most people use an egg wash or buttermilk to coat the chicken in and then batter it but I don't. Once your oil or grease is heated and ready slowly put battered chicken in the frying pan and once the firat side has cooked, turn the temperature down to medium or medium-high. Finish cooking the rest of the chicken and make sure to periodically check the chicken to make sure it is fully cooked meaning not bleeding or no red areas in the chicken. You could also use Fish Fry batter instead of adding ingredients. For spicy chicken add curry, red peppers, chilli powder, crushed jalapenos in batter or tabasco sauce while cooking. There is also a hot sauce called Spontaneous Combustion. This stuff will make any food very hot. You may not be able to finish it because your mouth is on fire.

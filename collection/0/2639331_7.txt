i have 8 hamsters, mostly dwarf hamsters xD. okay to tell the difference, first the distance from the private part to the ashole is a way to tell the genders, i'm serious. And to know whether they are humping, i wonder about that about my hamsters too, if one is on TOP of the another with their private parts facing each other, then it is not humping, just the hamsters playing around. if one is in its normal position and the other goes behind, then that's humping.

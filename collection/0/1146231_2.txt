That's complicated. Personally, I am afraid of people with guns; however, my best friend is from a big cop family and when he talks about his cop relatives, I always find myself feeling better about the guys/girls with guns. So for me, it isn't dislike, but varying degrees of fear that I feel regarding police officers.

First of all, it isn't all whites or all blacks that don't get along. There are some individuals in both groups that don't want to get along with anyone, because their "programming" is flawed. . . Second, it isn't just whites and blacks that don't get along.  I've known some short people that don't like tall people, some red-headed people that don't like black haired people, women that hate men, men who hate women,  dog lovers that can't stand cat lovers, people that love ballet who don't like people who watch NASCAR, and the list just goes on and on. . . The flaw in the programming is someone thinking they deserve something just because they're here, thinking they are better by birth, relieving them of the responsibility to add value to themselves and the world around them. . . The world doesn't owe anyone anything. More than that, the world gives less to people that think it does than to those who are grateful for everything that has been given since they first arrived here upside-down and naked.

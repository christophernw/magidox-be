First, a training collar such as a choke collar or a prong ("pinch") collar and a good leash are your best tools for the job.  By a good leash, I mean either a leather or nylon leash 4 to 6 feet in length, NOT a Flexi-lead or other adjustable leash.  Hold the leash so that the dog has about 4' to work with.  Hold it with boths hands at your waist on the same spot on the leash and walk in a straight line.  As soon as the dog gets in front of you and starts pulling, immediately make a quick turn around and go the opposite direction.  Keep doing this each time the dog makes the leash tight--whatever way he pulls, you turn and go the opposite way.  Keeping both hands at your waist helps you remain strong so that when the dog DOES pull, you don't get dragged along behind and you have the strength to make the correction by turning the in opposite direction.  Doing this exercise teaches him to pay attention to what you're doing and follow you.  YOU are the leader, not him! ;-)

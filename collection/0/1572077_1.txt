The Intel 8085 was an 8-bit microprocessor made by Intel in the mid-1970s. It was binary compatible with the more-famous Intel 8080 but required less supporting hardware, thus allowing simpler and less expensive microcomputer systems to be built.. . The "5" in the model number came from the fact that the 8085 required only a 5-volt (V) power supply rather than the 5V and 12V supplies the 8080 needed.

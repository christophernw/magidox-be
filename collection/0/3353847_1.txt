I don't see how celebrities are influencing prostitution, but what I do see is the rise in eating disorders, low self-esteem and young girls trying to be sexy.  As far as actual prostitution I have not heard of someone turning to prostitution because of a celebrity, but I definitly feel that young people are starting to have sex younger and younger because of the images of these young stars partying on t.v. and changing partners every few days or weeks also smoking, and drinking is very popular among young people because of seeing these people indulging in these things on t.v.

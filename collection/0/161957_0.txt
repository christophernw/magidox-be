It all depends on where you live. ie  in the UK, you write a letter to the local education authority and one to the head of your school. It has to inform them of what you are doing ie your intention to home-educate. "Education Otherwise" will tell you exactly what to say (they will dictate it for you if you phone them). Look them up on the internet.    Other countries such as USA have different policies and home-ed is more common.  You don't tend to use timetables, and really you  tend to encourage the child to  find his/her own levels and interests.   You can find anything out by opening a book, so why the question about cookery and CV's.  A library and computer will offer all the info you need.       However, if your child is actually happy at school (and we all have off days), then I'd leave them there.    Otherwise contact a few organisations about homeschooling that you will find on the internet.                PS  I took my daughter out of school at age 12 after she suffered from bullies, and the problem couldn't be resolved after a year.  It took the pressure off her.  I had to let her learn (or not as the case may be), slowly in her own time.  She did funnily enough actually go through a phase of cooking --- started with shop bought packets, and then the real thing.  Then when she was 16 she went to a college and did a course in cooking. She now has a job doing this.    Not everyone is destined for university, and I think the main thing is that they should grow up happy.

It's called interval training. Interval training increases your pace, while maintaining your endurance. It's a way to train your heart to pump faster without wearing it out. On an outdoor track interval training is done the same way, but under your own power. You run at your normal pace for a lap or two, then you run at an increased pace for a lap or two, then slow back down to your normal pace. You repeat this over and over to introduce your heart (and muscles) to the harder workout.

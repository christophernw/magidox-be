Commercials.. . You can stick a commercial in between every down in football if you want to.  The game is so boring because after every 10 second play you need to wait 35 seconds for the next one to start.  They can throw a bunch of commercial timeouts in there.  And between quarters is great for ads.    . . The more commercials = more money = More airtime = more popularity.    -[and repeat]-. . Take it or leave it, but you watch WAY more commercials than you do actual football.. . -- follow it down all the way to soccer.  no stops, no commercials.

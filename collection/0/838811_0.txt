O'Keeffe's style changed over time, as any artist's style does, but she was influenced by primarily three forces: 1) Japanese design taught her to fill space in a beautiful way and to balance light and dark. 2) European abstract 3) The American southwest desert which became her favorite subject.. . She eventually developed her own style which is both sensous and austere. She rejected realism in favor of simplified flat patterns and color harmonies inspired by Japanese art.

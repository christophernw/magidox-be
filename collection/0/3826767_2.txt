It's not so much that there are two picture of the WHOLE creation --that 'big picture' is only drawn in Genesis 1.  It is rather a matter of the 'second account' in Genesis 2 backtracking or stopping to focus its attention much more narrowly on the place of HUMANITY in God's creation, as it begins to tell the story of what HAPPENED to people -- the RELATIONSHIP they had with God and how the GOOD creation portrayed and chapter 1 (and chapter 2 agrees that it was good at the outset!) went offtrack through human rebellion.. . That focus on the relationship with God is seen in the fact that, whereas the 'big picture' of the great King over all his creation in chapter 1 uses the general name "God", whereas chapter 2 adds the 'personal name' (by which the people of Israel came to know him) 'the LORD [or 'Yahweh') God.. . Another example of the 'big picture' vs. focused or 'little picture'/microcosm.   In chapter 1 we see God 'building' and ordering the WHOLE of creation as great Kings in the Near East would build their palaces (or as the gods would build their temples -- the word for 'palace' and 'temple'. by the way, is the same in Hebrew).  In chapter 2 the picture is of God (the LORD) setting up a special/specific 'holy place' (with terms that often echo descriptions of the OT Temple) where he would come to meet with his people.  . . And, of course, the focus on PEOPLE is narrower in chapter 2.  In Genesis 1 we see God addressing all mankind and the role he intends them to have; in chapter 2 the focus turns to the first individual man and woman.

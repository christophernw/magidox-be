hi i have a lop as well :) sometimes he doesn't like to be energetic for a week or maybe a couple of days, but when he decides to be non- energetic and tries to do what he wants, you have to become the boss! i don't mean tie a lead round his neck and strangle him but try a harness and take him outside. let him take you because if you try to lead him you'll both just get annoyed :).    You could also try getting him to do stuff and then reward him with a treat. this way s/he will realize that's a good thing to do. I did this with my rabbit for 2-3 weeks and now he'll listen to me and he'll actually follow me when we go for a walk :).    You could try talking to your rabbit and getting him to trust you more. You could strengthen the bond between you :).    If the vet says he's perfectly healthy i wouldn't worry because he's living a very chilled life :D if he is getting a little over weight just try to help him. if it gets serious you have to force him, i don't mean it meanly but for example my rabbit is still young and couldn't burrow, i worried because it's getting really cold, so i tried and tried to get him to di it by forcing him to do it for 4 or 5 days and he can do it now :). . .     well i hope this advice helps you and good luck!

I like your question. I am sure it affects the subconscious mind in someway. Have you noticed how you can hum a song all day and suddently realize that you were doing it later on? that tells you that your subcon was affected in someway or another. I would say that some songs could have a positive affect and some negative. Subliminal messages are around us all the time, bombarding you through music and t.v! thats why some youths commit suicide or can have hyper or agressive behavior. I'm 41 now and  listening to all kinds of stuff. I try and reprogram my mind by using hypnosis. Check out the following website its so kewl and helpful in cleaning out the closet ( subconscious mind).

You will feel irritable for a short time.  You will have a bit of spaceyness.  Your blood sugar will be lower which might make you hungry.  Your metabolism will slow.  Your mind will play tricks on you trying to convince you not to stop.  BUT, if you do, the next side effects will be:  fresh breath, no panic as to where to smoke, clean clothes, clean fingers, clean lungs, increased energy and time not to mention an extended life span!

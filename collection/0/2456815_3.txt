A trick of the light... Your eyes can actually take in only so much at a time, and your brain has to process that information...  You can't see an airplane propeller spinning at 3000 rpm, you just get a sense of a blurry space where the propeller is spinning.. . At certain speeds, your eyes will tend to "catch" sight of a rotating object at key points.  If those points appear at identical positions at the right times, it appears that the object is stationary.  If the object rotates a little bit faster, we percieve that it rotates one direction, if the object slows down, we percieve it rotating in a different direction.. . The effects become more pronounced in artificial lighting, as fluorescent lights have a very minor "flicker" at 60 cycles per second.  The human eye can't normally percieve this in quality lights, but cheaper models may flicker more, and the amount of electricity from that wire being used also has an effect.. . On television, you are limited to 24 frames per second, so the effect becomes even more pronounced on TV.  Also, if you use a video recorder to record a TV, the signals rarely sync up, and thus you will percieve a flicker on the recorded set.. . LCD and Plasma monitors do not work the same way, and will present a steady image if captured on video.

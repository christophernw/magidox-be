Christmas tells us the meaning of life - the meaning of Christmas doesn't lie in having a lot of presents or enjoying fine food. The meaning of Christmas, instead, lies in being generous. In the eyes of faith, the meaning of life lies in being generous with one another because God is generous with us. At Christmas we discover again in Jesus that God is infinite generosity; and in God's generosity to us and our generosity to one another, we discover again the meaning of life.

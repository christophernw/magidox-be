To "gait" a dog is to move him at a trot, not a pace.  This is used to evaluate structure in the showdog.  Most dog breeds should have "moderate" movement; ie the front legs, when fully extended should reach to a straight line dropped from the dog's nose.  The rear legs should extend in a like fashion.  Movement should always be balanced.  The front should extend to the same degree as the rear.

Ozone blocks harmful UV rays, without ozone harmful rays like this damage our skin - they cause skin cancers in humans and animals. They can also damage plants, plastics and probably plenty of other things. Here in Tasmania, the ozone above us is very thin (it's called a hole, but is not a hole is just very thin) and we get burned here (sunburn) very very easily even on a cloudy day. Humans can wear hats and sunscreen but animals and plants cannot - so when the ozone is depleted the harmful rays burn and damage them easily.

The games themselves don't have an influence in one's attitude. The reason your mother believes you have an attitude problem after you play the game is most likely of your after-emotions. When someone plays a game for a prolonged time, they feel edgy and short-tempered after they're done. It's quite natural for your mother to believe that game is responsible for the problem. . . Your mother loves you and anything she says to you is because she cares for you. She may not be right all the time but be open-minded and hear her out.

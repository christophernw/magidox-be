Totally ignore the cat- never acknowledge that you even have a sense of hearing.  If you were deaf, the cat would have to get your attention in some other way.  Meowing only works because we teach them it works.  You can also make sure to feed the cat away from your house and never feed it if it meows at you.  Cats can be trained just like any other animal.

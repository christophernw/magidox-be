Because it is now hours later I recommend soaking the area with very hot water. Not hot enough to burn him but very hot. This will help draw out the poison. If this had just happened I would recommend peeing on the wound. I know this sounds weird but the vinegar in the urine helps to counter the poison. He will be fine the poison just hurts. A dose of Tylenol and Advil together after eating will help with the pain. Yes, both at one time is OK, they are different drugs.

Im 27 and i've been voting ever since I was 18. . I think part of why some people in the age 18 - 35 group do not bother to vote at all is because either they don't care who is in charge or they have no knowledge of the Political system and so forth.. . Then again I am amazed at how many idiots think the President of the United States is suppose to also fulfill the duties of Congress, Governors and Mayors which makes me wonder if we should reduce down who is even allowed to vote.. . Such as requiring one to take a test (which I would pass for sure but most of the Public would fail this test).

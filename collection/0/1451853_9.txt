Science cannot tell us the "origin" of the universe.  The modern scientific method is not a method that will lead us to discover the origin of the universe because it is a method that is based on measureable fact.  Science works by observation and by quantification (measurement).  . . Now no one was there to "observe" the universe as it was being created, and no one can "measure" anything that can reveal to us the origin of universe, or even its age.

it's the first type of reaction. It is called Composition. usually a metal + a nonmetal to form a compound like MgCl2.. . It's can also be called an ionic compound because a cation( positive charged ion) + an anion (- charged particle) is combined.. it means that Mg is in group 2 because it gave Cl a subscript of 2. and Cl has -1 charged giving Mg 1 as a subscript. just use the method of crisscrossing. and u'll know their subscripts.

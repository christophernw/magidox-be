it is unto a man once to die and then the judgment.....The spirit of a man or woman never dies and therefore needs to go somewhere...God originally intended for man to never die but after the original sin that all changed now we have only 2 choices Heaven or Hell....the way to heaven is already paid for you just have to accept the gift that Jesus paid for in faith.

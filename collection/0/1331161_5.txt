You are building up static electricity when you slide across your car seat...Did you know this small spark can ignite gas fumes when filling up your fuel tank? true also it happens to women more then men because most men stand by the pump while a woman goes and sits back in the car to stay warm....also sliding fuel cans across the bed of a pickup can also cause static electricity and ignite gas fumes..Don't forget cell phones small electrical spark from them and its boom boom also..The net has video this happening in gas stations..Does it happen often not really but why take the chance cause it can happen..their really is some thought into fuleing a vehicle.

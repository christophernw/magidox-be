Its obvious why America rave over Borat.. . Kazakhstan? Where's that? Sounds like a Muslim country! How funny.. . Obviously he's a Jew and America loves Jews and to hear anything negative about Muslims is like getting their national anthem coming out of his ar*e to them!. . There has to be some limit with comedy. He's not even funny,  and ugly on top of it.. . Look at how the media reacted to Cat Stevens becoming a Muslim- they hated him for it- they deliberately misinterpreted what he said about Salman Rushdie (rest in hell) to get back at him for converting. All the media want to do now is spread anti- Islamic feeling, especially Jews, Hindus and Sikhs.

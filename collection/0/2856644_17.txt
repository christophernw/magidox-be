He was bad even before that.. He chose to reject God because he thought he was too good to save him.. The fact that we now know what evil is and do it, might not seem all that negative.. The thing that was wrong was telling us that we would then become equals to God because we would know what he knows.. That simply isn't true. Even if we knew all God did ( which we don't) we still would not have the power he has.. Misinformation and lying is wrong. That is what makes Lucifer bad. . Lucifer never offered the knowledge to us. He couldn't give it to us we had to take it (eat the fruit). We chose this new form of knowledge.. What was wrong is that he told us we would then become like God, and that will never be possible.

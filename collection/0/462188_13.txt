An iPod IS an MP3 player.  The only difference between iPods and other MP3 players is the brand name. The same mistake is often made with TiVos and DVR's. A TiVo IS a DVR, just as an iPod IS an MP3 player, but the two brand names have become so popular now that people often believe they are another technology altogether. Don't be fooled. The only difference is that iPods are called iPods, and other assorted MP3 players are called by whichever brand makes them. Simple as that.. . (HOWEVER - obviously the user interfaces and some of the features are going to vary from system to system, but the main point I wanted to make was that the iPod IS an MP3 player. It just happens to be the most popular. And therefore, I would recommend it.)

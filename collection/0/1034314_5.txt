First of all does it matter one way or another if someone is gay or not. If not then why ask? If you suspect that someone that you go to school with may be gay and you are a real friend then ask them but, make sure you do it in private. Most gay people are honest and will answer the question if they do not feel threatened. If they are gay then stay friends with them good friends are hard to come by.

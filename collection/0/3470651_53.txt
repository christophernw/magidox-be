Hi, I had a friend with the same problem during the winter, caused by the heater and the shoes rubber soils. What you can do: Grab a metallic object (make a chain of paper clips for example) and tie it to your boots to create a pole down to earth and diminish the impact of the electrostatic. Remember; IT ALWAYS HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE FLOOR TO MAKE IT WORK. IT HELPS! good luck!

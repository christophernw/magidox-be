Clip his claws on a regular basis & buy him a scratching post.  I would get him a sisal one & if that doesn't work I would try a carpeted one.  Everytime he starts to claw the sofa move him to the scratching post.  It might take a while but he'll get the idea eventually.  As a last resort, you could front de-claw although I hate to see that happen.

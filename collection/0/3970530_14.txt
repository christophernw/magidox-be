well this happened to me and u might actually be having an allergic reaction to the contacts..try wearing glasses for a couple of days and see how ur eyes feel...if they feel much better then it might be gps...which is giant pappilary syndrome..its not as scary as it sounds but u might have to change ur brand of contacts.

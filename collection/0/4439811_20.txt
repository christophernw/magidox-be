I blame everything on our society. For instance you have a young girl who was just dumped by her boyfriend and she is devastated, well our society puts such emphasis on being part of a couple , you HAVE to have someone to prove your loved. Bascially you have to keep up with the joneses and if you cant then you are outcast. There are some people that cannot handle the pressure of not being "IN".

Upside-Down cakes originated in North America, and were (and sometimes still are) baked in cast iron frying pans. These cakes are unique in that a decorative fruit topping is baked under the cake batter. Upside-Down Cakes are self-decorating cakes. Just bake and serve. The most popular upside-down cake is Pineapple.. All upside-down cakes are made about the same. The first step is to melt butter or margarine in the pan in the preheated oven. Remove the pan and sprinkle the sugar. The sliced fruit is then decoratively arranged in the bottom of the pan. The cake batter is carefully poured over the fruit. While the cake is baking, the butter and sugar caramelizes. After the cake is baked, it is immediately inverted onto a serving plate. . Sponsored Links. Cupcake Wedding CakesShop on eBay and Save!

Upside-Down Cakes are great freezer cakes. Take a cookie sheet and place a large piece of plastic wrap on it. Place the cake in the middle. Put it in the freezer for an hour. This will harden the cake enough so that the toppings wonâ€™t stick when completely wrapped with plastic wrap. Then re-wrap with heavy aluminum foil or place in a freezer resealable bag. Completely unwrap before defrosting. To serve just a couple of pieces warm, heat them individually either in the microwave or the oven. Times will vary depending on piece size. More even heating will be achieved if the cake is completely defrosted first.

Nothing will help you relax, not the beatles, nor the most relaxing bath until you learn to deal with your anxiety. All of the aforementioned solutions are only distractions which hopelessly attempt to beguile you, stealing you away from that which troubles you. Dive in, understand what's going on, find ways to reduce your anxiety by dealing with the underlying issues which trouble or worry you. Therapy is a good start, add a little anti-anxiety medication if that helps; go to the gym for a good workout, relax in your hot-tub after a good massage and listen to Abby Road, side 1.

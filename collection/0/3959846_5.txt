x^2-b^2=0 Split the variables apart since there is a ^2. (x-b)(x+b)=O  . . You can check your answer in a few ways, one is substituting x for let say 2, and b for 3.. . x^2-b^2=(x-b)(x+b). 2^2-3^2=(2-3)(2+3). -5=-5. . Another way is solving from (x-b)(x+b).. . (x-b)(x+b) Factor out. (+x*+x)(+x*+b)(-b*+x)(-b*+b)  (*=times). = x^2+xb-xb-b^2   .   (+xb-xb=0). = x^2-b^2. . . Hope you understand. It can get confusing sometimes. :)

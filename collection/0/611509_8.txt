it is because u r the one, who is there to be blamed, even tho they know,it isnt ur fault. im a waitress, and last time there was customer shouting at me cuz his meal wasnt good, and that idiot knew, i didnt make it, i just brought it, be he still shouted at me,instead of going to see chef. so i just told him to stop shouting, that i can hear quite well. just ignore them, u know,thats wot i do.

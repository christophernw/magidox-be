The reason is your love. Love leads to expectations. You expect them to be perfect in all aspects as you prefer. . The person who cares more for his self-esteem will always do what you are doing now. There is nothing wrong in expecting your own members to do things perfect. Only thing you should be careful is the way you express your thoughts. . When you are able to control your words while on emotions, then that is the great achievement. Those controlled and focussed words can tune those persons perfect and make them stay in touch with you always. . Everything is within our reach. It only depends on how we try and the way we try.

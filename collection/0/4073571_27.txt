Jesus came to heal to sinner's heart........... . one keeps confusing healing with physical.... put spiritual healing first.....any physical healing that occurs is just gravy.... . one needs to get on the road to heaven before one needs to be physically healed. . througout the new testament Jesus always wanted one to understand "believe" "reborn"  "accept" "repent" "seek forgiveness".  Believe gospel truth.... one needs to see and hear that gospel spiritually or one is still blind and deaf and sick physically....even dead to the world.... . when one seeks the kingdom of god Matt 6:33 and is forgiven of SIN one is healed of all things spiritually.... does not matter the physial condition your spiritual condition is right with God and at that point you have eternal life everlasting.. that is what James 5:14 refer to....if any is sickly...let elders anoint and lay hands upon....... . let one be prayer for is spiritual healing first......and physical healing--if God's will after............. . pray for that physical healing yes--all the time---God does do that.... He does answer pray.... . but get that spirtual healing first.......and keep it foremost..

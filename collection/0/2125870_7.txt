It's not greed.. . It's taxes (federal and state are about 45 cents/gallon).. Plus California formulas cost more to refine and are virtually only made in the state, ie not imported from Oregon or Arizona, to keep prices down.. . And most of all, because of demand.  People are too lazy to change their habits.  I don't see a lot of people selling their trucks or SUVs, buying fuel-efficient cars.  Or walking, riding a bike, or taking public transit.. . You want cheap fuel?  Move to Venezuela, Mexico, Iran, or even China.  They all pay less than $1 per gallon.  But you might find some quality of life issues.. . Brazil is self-sufficient because they discovered and developed large oil fields off their coast.  And, yeah, they make ethanol from sugar cane.  But not 100%.

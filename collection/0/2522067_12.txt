liberals historically have identified and confronted "evil" in the forms you're mentioning. . . FDR fought Hitler and the Axis powers in WWII, FDR stared down the communists during the Cold War during the Cuban Missile crisis, etc. Clinton fought to end the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia during his administration. . . Additionally, it was liberals who led the charge against apartheid (and system that many consider "evil") and the larger "liberal" tradition has fought tyranny in both esoteric and immediate ways.

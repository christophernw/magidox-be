1st of all b positive.If every1 is scoldin u then 1st luk at d reason why they r doin it n think abt it.for eg if ur not doin gud in studies then try 2 study n do better also tell others not 2 nag abt it as u urself know ur shortcumins n tell them dat ull do better.2ndly follow d principal of not givin a damn abt  wat others think of u.If u pay attention 2 every1 n wat they r sayin then u urself will not b  able 2 think clearly.3rdly b urself n always hav a high opinion of urself becauz dats d key always think +ve n  hav faith in urself :)

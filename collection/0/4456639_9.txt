Because, like humans, the modern monkeys and apes also evolved from earlier monkeys and apes, but clearly not at different rates and in different directions. Why do different species of cat exist? Because they all evolved from earlier primitive cats. Lions did not evolve from tigers, did they? . . We may yet agree- there is only one right answer. . . I don't pretend to know how the universe or life originally began, although I have strong leanings toward certain theories. . But I know for certain, due to undeniable, hard reproducible evidence, that evolution - over millions of years - is a fact.. . Anything else is not supported by evidence, just faith.

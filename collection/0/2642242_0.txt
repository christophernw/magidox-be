Unless you can provide the court with proof, that your daughter is in jeopardy.  I would suggest you grow up, and realize that your ex won't let anything happen to his daughter, stop using her as a pawn.  The only person that's going to look like a schmuck in the end is you, because sooner or later, your child will realize what you've been doing and not be all that pleased.

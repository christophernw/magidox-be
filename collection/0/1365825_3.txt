It works just like a desktop computer, however the hardware is different in size and some of them are propriety. One important detail to keep in mind is that you have to keep and eye on the battery and the ways to save energy. Adding some hardware is a snap like a Wi-Fi adapter, a modem etc..etc you can also attach a mouse if you get tired of using the touch pad.

You don't say what year your car is but newer cars have non asbestos brake linings and they can be noisey. If it's brake squeal it can be stopped and I would be taking your car back to the repairer. However, it will come back over time as disc brakes are characterised by their noisey nature. Jules. Mechanic. Australia.

society needs someone or something to blame, they view animals just as that animals, not individuals.  pets/dogs have unique personalities, some natural, some taught by aggressive masters, there are 2 common reasons dogs attack/bite, self defense/preservation or trained to do so, circumstances dictate why a dog does what it does when it bites/attacks.  Dogs do have thought patterns, why do you think they whine when u leave for work and get excited when your home, why do the choose a favorite between a husband and a wife.  the only difference for dogs is some tought patterns work on a more primordial level SURVIVAL.

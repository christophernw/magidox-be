Just because certain members of a species mutate and evolve, doesn't mean the whole species dies.  (Unless there is some cataclysmic event where only the mutated animals can survive.). . Certain primates in specific areas started evolving over a long period of time, so that they could hunt better and survive.  Over a long period of time, the ones that didn't hunt better starved and died, or got eaten by predators.  The ones that did survive and had babies.  Repeat several hundred thousand times and you have two distinct species.. . Discovery Channel just had a pretty good documentary about this recently, though I unfortunately can't remember the name of it.  You could probably google it...

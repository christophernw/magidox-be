Just like cholesterol there is good fat and bad fat. Nuts have the good fat to help you reach ideal weight and helps prevent wrinklles, heart attacks and strokes. On the other hand, lard is so bad for health, that a deroagatory name uses it--lard ass (vulgar term for buttocks). See my nickname. There are ginkgo nuts.

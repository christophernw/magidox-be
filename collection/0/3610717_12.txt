Some people think of language, especially nouns ('labels') as fixed or definite.. . Other people think of meaning ('intention') as fixed.. . In fact, we only have a very vague grip on what we actually mean (like, are you talking about a jointy thing hanging off a hand, or a thing you poke buttons with in the lift?), and words change their meanings every time they are used (when I last said 'finger', did I mean EXACTLY what I meant the previous time?). . When we use a word, we're only guessing what the person hearing or reading it will think we meant. Often, we're wrong, but we only find out occasionally.

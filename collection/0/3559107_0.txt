hddvd works on a infrared laser reader.. . blue ray works on a blue ray not red reader, because a blue light wave is shorter than a red light wave you can actually fit more data on a disc.. . there is talk that a blue ray disc could eventually be around 20-30 gig per disc as opposed to a red disk which is standard at 4.7 gig.. . this would mean you could potentially have full movies of hd images.

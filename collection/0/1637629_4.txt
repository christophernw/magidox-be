Trust me on this one: ADVANTAGE.  Regular grooming and a once monthly treatment with ADVANTAGE will work.  Do not allow him to mingle with other cats or dogs who have not been treated.  Treat all cats and dogs in the house with the proper ADVANTAGE formula.  The infestation will lesson rapidly, and in two to three months it will be a thing of the past.. . Yours Purringly,. W.C.

check with your doctor. he can prescribe you the best there is. there are several good ones that is available only as prescription medicine. but some cures is to avoid coffee or chocolates. . . i know one that helps me, but there is an exception, you have to inform the doctor if you have anything that will cause side effect. do not request it if you have high blood pressure or heart problem, it will cause more damage on your situation. . . cause i have migraine so bad, i have to be taken to emergency every time so they can give me injection, it will take few of minutes and i will be fine. then, my doctor prescribe it in a form of a tiny pills made by glaxo that is so powerful and very expensive that my insurance can only give me 6 in a month. . . but consult your doctor so you will know what other option you have before you decide for yourself.

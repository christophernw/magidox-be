I can't answer the first question, but i can answer the second.. . The color of the leave in the fall is determined by what minerals are in the leaves...the more iron that is in the leaf, the redder it will be.  The reason you cannot see this in the summer is because it is masked by the clorophyll.  There is so much of it, you just can't see the other colors.  When the tree prepares to be dormant for the winter, the chorophyll is removed from the leaf, and the other colors show through.

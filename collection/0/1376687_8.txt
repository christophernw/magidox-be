I have run the numbers on this several times in the past -- can't believe this question comes up every day, and each now poster thinks he or she is the first.. . The Hubble telescope has a resolution of 0.1 arc-second.  At the range to the moon (roughly a quarter million miles), one arc second is a spot with a diameter of about 15 meters (~50 feet).. . The largest piece of equipment we left behind on the moon was the bottom portion of the LEM, which was about 4 meters across.. . So even with the Hubble, the best telescope running, the LEM would cover an area less than one pixel on the CCD cameras used to record the picture.. . Trying to see the flag left on the moon with the Hubble would be like trying to determine the sex of a fruit fly a mile away with a pair of binoculars.  Can't be done.

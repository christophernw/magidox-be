Do the best you can and do not engage in activities that tear down other people.  People will respond to you and come to know you as a very good person, which, in my opinion, will cause you to prosper.  Also, maintain a good attitude.  Do not complain too much because no one will want to talk to you.  Asking this question is one step in the right direction.  Good luck!

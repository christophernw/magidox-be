Because people are curious about the human side of Jesus. I don't think most people are trying to defame Jesus by asking questions. (Unless those questions are intentionally made to riducule Him.) I do think that people are curious about his daily life and if he was married. In the Jewish society of that time, an unmarried man or woman had no official place. Nearly everyone was married. So people naturally want to know if Jesus was married, too.

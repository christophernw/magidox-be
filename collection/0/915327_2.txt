In very cold conditions wiper blades can freeze and stick to the glass. Putting a plastic bag over them will stop this, but remember to remove them before driving off !. It works really well for any car window as well. Use a refuse bag and stick it on a wet or damp window. Then in the morning when everything is iced up, just peel off the bag. No need to de-ice.

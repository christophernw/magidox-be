God DOESN'T TALK TO HUMAN BEINGS.  We're not important enough to him, and we don't understand his language.  Not at all.. . God does not give us "faith."  God himself has no faith.. . So what can you get as direction?  "Vision."  You can get snapshots, visions, images.  These are pictures of what is important and what you should be doing.  But be careful, because they are also commands.. . Avoid talk and actual conversation -- you can't rely on it -- you don't know if it is a lonely voice in your own head.

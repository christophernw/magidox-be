When the stock market is doing well, the companies that do well are the industrial companies (think smokestacks) like Caterpillar, Deere, Freeport-McMoran, and Dow Chemical.  Also, when the economy does well small-caps can offer higher returns.  When the economy isn't doing well, people usually run to the blue-chips (the companies everyone knows like General Electric and other Dow Components) and in particular the sector that does the best are consumer staples.  These are food and medicine stocks like CVS, Safeway, Pepsico, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, etc.  The reason that these stocks do well in a down stock market is because their earnings are not effected by the economy's ups and downs because people are going to eat and are going to keep their medicine whether the economy is doing great or poorly.

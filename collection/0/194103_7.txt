This is hilarious...somebody actuall answered this question by blaming Bush, too funny.  Everything is Bush's fault to some morons in this country.. . I don't think there's any solid evidence that crime is getting worse or more bizarre.  I think that the media definitely covers the "bad" news a lot more than "good" news.  People won't turn in for a puppy rescue story, but they sure will for a murder suicide.

It appears to me that you neighbour is trying to antagonise you  by bringing the pigs in so that you retaliate with doing something equally as bad.  Dont fall for it. I assume you are in the UK in which case  I am sure  are laws in country which govern keeping of ,livestock in a garden. A farm animals belongs in er.... farm, so report him/her to the RSPCA I am sure they will be interested in the animals welfare. Just tell the RSPCA that you saw them kicking the animals/beating them with a stick and holding them from their tails and swinging them or something similar . The council is already kind of on your side anyway so they will believe you. If you have a baby or young kids then I am sure they are being affected too..... . The last resort is to take the idiots to court.. I'll find out my brother is a lawyer

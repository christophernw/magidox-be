I don't know. I don't like either of them at all. Despite what people think when they simply see me, I am very nice and considerate, in all honesty. I just normally have a certain level of respect for each person I come in contact with, and when they're rude to me, I usually lose it for them. I am nice to people because my whole life I have been mistreated, very creully. I didn't like going through it, and now that I have grown even more, I did not let them destoy my humanity, and after knowing what it feels like, I don't want to cause anyone else to feel what I felt growing up.. . . Being inconsiderate it not taking people into consideration. I think that is rude in itself, so to me, they go hand in hand. Because being rude is not taking people(and their feelings) into consideration...and not taking people and their feelings into consideration is rude. See, when I do things, I think of how it will affect the people around me. If I am in a bad mood and mean to someone for no reason, I think of how that would hurt their feelings, and the consequences it might have on that person.... . Call me weird or old fashioned...I just like giving people a crap day, adn making them feel like crap. I don't like it when I get it all the time, and I have yet to just lash out for no reason...I have my integrity.... . That's how I think about it..

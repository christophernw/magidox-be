I think you mean a vasa gene.. The vasa gene, essential for germ-cell development, was originally identified in Drosophila, and has since been found in other invertebrates and vertebrates. Analysis of these vasa homologs has revealed a highly conserved role for Vasa protein among different organisms, as well as some important differences in its regulation.

Maybe I am reading your question wrong, but are you saying that liberals can't be Christians and vice versa? I'm a liberal, but I am also a Christian (and not in that order). I don't hate Christmas either! You are generalizing a large population of people based on what? . . As an educator, I will say that  I feel a need to be considerate of people's religions, particularly in school. The fact is that this nation is made up of people from all backgrounds, nationalities and religions. No one should force their religion on anyone else, and that happens too often. If I have a student who doesn't celebrate Christmas, I am respecting of their views and feel everyone needs to be as well.

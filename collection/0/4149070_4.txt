Battery terminals corrode due to oxidation of the acid on the metal battery terminals when current pass through it. The best solution i've done so far is put a thin coating of silicone paste on the exposed terminals. it has been months since i last applied it but still no sign of corrosion. if no silicone paste is available, you can use oil or grease instead.

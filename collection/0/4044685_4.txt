Birds' eggs dont have to be white. Robins eggs are blue. I had a european blackbird's nest in my yard last year that had 3 speckled turquoise eggs. The colours are often a characteristic of the species but ther can be a lot of variation.. consider the humble domestic chicken, white, brown, speckled. . Eggs can also vary in colour due to what the birds are fed

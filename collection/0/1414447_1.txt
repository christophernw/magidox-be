Don't remember exactly.  . . BUT-  You should listen to this book on tape called "Get Clark Smart".  It is excellent and explains all kinds of insurances, mutual funds, ira's, how to buy a house, etc.  He doesn't use any jargon so it is truly easy to understand.  (It is only 2 cassettes front & back- about 3 hours maybe.)  It goes into detail on what is best for you in mutual funds.  he explains how/ when/ how much to buy at what age, etc.  You will enjoy it.  I was surprised I did.  He makes tremendous sense.. . I heard he also has a radio show in some cities but I don't know where.

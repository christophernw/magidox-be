The entire nail is actually all one color; the part of the nail which is attached to your finger looks different because of your flesh underneath which is showing through. The combination of your raw skin underneath and the whitish color of the nail itself produces a different color, which can vary between people depending on the color of their flesh (not necessarily skin color). The part of your nail that grows away from your finger is the actual color of the nail.

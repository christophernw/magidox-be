This is interesting because my grandmother warns about eating late because you might get nightmares (I thought it was a superstition, cultural thing) but I think it does happen then if thats what your experiencing.... . My Theory:. . "I think that when you eat right before bed, since its harder for your stomach to digest your food laying down, your brain reacts while your asleep to the stomach pain you get, causing you to feel bad in your dreaming state - triggering nightmares?"

"We do not feel that the earth is moving because we go along the surface of the earth as it moves. It is the gravitational force of the earth that holds everything down... The strength of the gravitational force exerted by one body over the other body, depends on their mass and the distance between the two objects. Objects with greater mass have a greater power of attraction. The earth, with its enormous mass, attracts all objects on it with quite some force. There is no question therefore of our falling off."  Or water either.. . -It's okay that you didn't know the answer, some people are dicks and have known everything since birth.  "gravity" is a crap answer for someone that doesn't understand, this should help some more.

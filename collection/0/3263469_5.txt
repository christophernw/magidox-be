It is considered by some to be a tribute to name yourself after a god or goddess,personally my craft name is the name of a species of tree,won't tell you which one,given to me BY the god and goddess during initiation,so I took it.I think if you choose the name of deity, that deity should have some quality you also have or it IS pretentious.

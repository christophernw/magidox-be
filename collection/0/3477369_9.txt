I think that your cat will always have that fear but your best bet is probably show her that there is nothing to fear when she is with you or your family...be patient and take time this behavior will not change overnight...It would also be wise, if you can, figure out what scares her the most and not do that action or at least advoid doing it...ANd if she is afraid of other people, when you have others come over put her in a room she feels comfortable in( ex: bedrooms) and close the door until they leave unless that frightens the poor thing...

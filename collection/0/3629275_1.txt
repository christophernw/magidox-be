If Can-co is a typo and Cinco de Mayo is what you're talking about then it is a holiday celebrated more in the Southwestern states (Texas, California etc.) than in Mexico.  The 5th of May celebrates Mexico's independance from France when Napolean decided to take over Mexico.  A small group of mexican farmers defeated the much larger French army.  Also, Cinco de Mayo is a great excuse for high school french and spanish clubs to have a Cinco de Mayo war with flour-filled painted eggs!!!

In the wild, dogs will only sit at the same level as an equal. Even then it can be seen as a challenge to that other dog.Technically you should be the 'head of the pack' so he would be justified (and respectful) in sleeping at a lower level than you. Apart from the fact he is probably just too hot to lie on a doona (he does wear a fur coat), he may just feel comfortable knowing his place and cooling off. This doesn't make you a bad owner - you just have to realise that whilst he is a 'mans best friend', he is first and foremost a dog!

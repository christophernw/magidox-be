You can get a credit number by applying for a credit card. After they send you one,if you look at the front of your card,you will see a 12 digit number that is your credit card number.. A zipcode is a number that is assigned to your street block it usually comes after your address.It is a way to determine what part of town you live in.. You can download movies off the internet and burn them on dvds.This is against the law so I wouldn't recommend this.I am sure if you google you will find some sites where you can do this but you probably will have to pay.

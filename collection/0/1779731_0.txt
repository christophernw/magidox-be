your impco mixer is a propane device and you need to take it to an installer and not try this yourself, the holly carb you would only use the bottom plate if your running lp only, but if its a duel fuel device then personally id trade up to a LP system only, your timimg is diferent on LP compaired to Gas   thats why duel fuel systems are only 1/2 good , not really set up for either they are set some where in between. if the system is on top of your carb its duel and if the carb mid section is impco its single, adjustment usually on the evaporator(the thing the heater hoses go to) two ajustsments one for richness and one for idle, lock nut use a wrench and a flat head screw driver

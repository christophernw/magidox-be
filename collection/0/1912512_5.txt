Take a long walk through a park? Go to the movies (although not much good is showing at this time, better movies come out in summer and around x-mas holidays), go out to eat with friends. Exercisidng is good for the body anyway, so a quick jog around the block might be good. You might even meet some nice new neighbors along the way. Or take up bike riding. You can even get something to put the pike on so you can ride it in the house while watching TV (like a bike stand).. Watch Ferris Beuller's day off, and do what he does. Go to a parade (if any), go to a outdoor sports game, go to a museum, go to a fancy restaurant.. "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."

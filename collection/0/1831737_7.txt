when doing aerobic excercise your muscles shouldnt ache.  anaerobic excercise is different.  anaerobic excerise is excersise that is too fast for you body to get the oxygen it needs travelling around your bloodstream.  when your muscles are deprived of this their regular amount of oxygen Lactic Acid is released causing the muscles to ache.  gentle "warmin up" excercise should be done before activity and "warming down" excercises after.  This should help avoid your muscles aching.

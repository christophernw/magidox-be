He is tight- he's keeping it real, telling it like it is- the muslims need to be shaped up a little, they shouldn't be getting all offended- and he's trying to get closer to Greek Orthodox and Muslims.  He is known as the olive pope, so hopefully he will unite the people- like an olive press does.  That is the rumor...it would be cool to see it happen.  He knows what he believes in and sticks to his guns- just what the church needs.

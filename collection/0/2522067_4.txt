and what have conservatives done? besides cause the world to hate the united states, France at least isn't invading countries under the lie of false democracy.You can call it liberation, but to me it seems more like setting up puppet regimes that will kiss bushes ass like tony blair and do what he says(like republicans give a shit about people in darfur? lol their just warmongers that masturbate ww2 battles on the history channel)

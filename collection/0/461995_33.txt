Usually a person can comfortably sit through 45 minutes of preaching and lets say an hour or so if the sermon is very anointed and touching. Generally people tend to lose interest if you extend more than that. Even in the church where I worship we do have this problem. Since I am helping with the church activities and taking care of the administration I have discussed this on many occasions with the Pastor. So our pastor as a rule of the thumb tries to round off the entire sermon in under 1 hour. Usually if he has a lot to cover then he continues the topic the next week and so on. Right now we are studying the mysteries of the bible and it is going on for the last month and a half. It took our pastor the best part of an year to complete the first few chapters of revelation. Since his sermons are with such power and anointing that people usually ask him to continue but like I said he closes it in just under an hour. So I feel your congregation are justified in complaining if the sermon were to extend that long. It is a good practice to stay under 1 hour as you could reserve your energy and put more study into your sermons and it also helps if your sermons are being video graphed as the tapes usually record up to an hour. Try doing this and then I am sure your congregation will ask for more. Hope that helps and May God Bless you and your congregation.

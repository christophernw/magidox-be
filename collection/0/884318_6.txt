I've raised Irish Setter puppies and Basset Hound puppies and in my opinion, 6 weeks is WAY to long to wait to ween the puppies. We normally started mixing some warm milk with some regular purina puppy chow at 4 weeks. At first they'll just lap up the milk and barely touch the food, but the moisture from the milk softens it and they'll come around really quick! Now, if the puppies can get ahold of momma's teats, they will. At four weeks, the puppies really start getting their teeth in and those little boogers are sharp!! Also, be sure to keep the puppies toe nails clipped. If they get long, the mother will be very hesitant to feed. They will scratch her terribly. . . I don't know what kind of puppies you have, but this is what has always worked for both my parents and my own personal experience.. . If you have any questions, feel free to email me or IM me. . . Hope I helped!

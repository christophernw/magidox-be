A lot will be written and exposed about the Bush - Bliar era but long after the event. (revisionist history).. A lot of people are very disappointed but you never know what you got till after you voted and get it.. It is only in the latter part of the period in power that the lies are exposed.. I pity all the people who believed in and voted for Bush and Blair that they have let down so badly.. Another generation of cynicism regarding self seeking politicians.. No wonder the majority of the public dont vote any more.

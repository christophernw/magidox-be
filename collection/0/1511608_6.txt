Change of the times i'm afraid, used to be cool to smoke, meant you had money, status etc. soon as they found out you could die from it or cause cancer to other people (passive smoking) your seen as a bad person. They'll soon move the tax onto something else such as drink, or petrol, or dvd's, or anything else that makes us happy  (try taxing sex lol)

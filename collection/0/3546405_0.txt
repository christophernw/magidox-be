Perhaps you picked it or knocked the scabs off a couple times on your arm, it would make sense and your chest didn't because it would be rather hard to knock a scab off your chest and they probably kept it covered. I mean I am sure you arm was covered as well but at some point it would have had to scab over. Just a thought.

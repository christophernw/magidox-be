Because the US Constitution says we don't and no amendment has been presented.  It won't happen, because law makers won't fire themselves.. . If you don't like who is in office, don't re-elect them.  US Congress every 2 years US Senate every 6 years.  This staggard approach creates balance and security in Washington.

A cut of meat from the thigh of a hog ... from a hog's hind leg, generally from the middle of the shank bone to the aitch (hip) bone.. . Cook this as you would a normal ham for the holidays. It is really good with pineapple slices, and cherry pie filling, and brown sugar. Baste it after it has baked for a while with the wonderful juices from the flavors of the cooking ham.

Registered Nurse here; Let me see if I can simplify this answer a bit, for unless your planning on a career in health care alot of the information given to you so far, is just plain complected, and there is no need to resort to this degree of sophistication in answering a well worded and important question, as you have ask.  A low creatine level means nothing more than "Thank God", your kidneys are working extremelly well and you have no disease process present.  Good enough, now don't worry and be happy.

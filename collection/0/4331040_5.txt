Some people are big because of genetics.  Some people don't eat like they should.  Nearly everyone is in a big hurry and they eat on the run.  Moms work away from home and are not house moms like they were in 'leave it to beaver' days.  So, fast meals from a box are today's convenience.  As a big girl it is hard to lose weight.  I catch myself eating too much because I eat in a hurry.  It is a habit that has developed over time... I used to work in the medical field  and we ate in a hurry and got back to our duties.  Then I traveled with my husband, and we were always in a hurry when we ate.  Now, I work in a field that 'networking' is important.  So, I often eat with a client or someone that is in the business 'network'.  I really need to watch my weight and my eating habits because my parents are both diabetics.

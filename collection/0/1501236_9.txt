Yes, I am proud of who I am.  Due to experiences and circumstances I have a hard time relating to men.  Why because they have damaged my inter soul at a depth that I have not been able to heal from as of yet.  My heart longs to be in relationship and so I choose to share my life with other woman.  Still looking for that special woman to conquer my heart and soul and who I am so that I can share the same in return.. . Thanks for asking the question.

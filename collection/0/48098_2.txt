I have family that has lost their jobs due to competition from other countries coming here willing to work for less pay.  The globalist are working at "leveling the playing field", which means wages worldwide is to be equalized.  Eventually everybody will be referred to as "workers of regions", no more middle class, just the rich and the poor.. . My daughter with a masters degree was told this week that funds for her job as Coordinator has been cut, so they're giving her a promotion to Director, with the same pay she has been earning as Coordinator.  Then told the title Director will probably be changed to Coordinator, meaning more hours and responsibility but same pay as the job she's leaving.  All in the name of globalism.

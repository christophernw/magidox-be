Let me starts by explaining that the word Ghosts simply means spirits, thats why you here of the holy ghost(holy spirit). There are also satanic ghosts(evil spirits). Ghosts exits. You don't have to here them to know they are there, u just need to read your bible well.. . Ghosts cannot just posses anybody; you have to invite them through many dirty rituals before they posses u. When u see a mad person, he is possessed by these ghosts. If you don't have strong faith in God, they can also be placed on you by those practising satanic rituals, or if you join occult. Simply said, if you are not careful, they can be placed on you. God is the only assurance of our safety.. . Yes ghosts are there; and whether u believe this or not does not change the truth that they are there.

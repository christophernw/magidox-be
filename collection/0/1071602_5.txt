Both rockhead and monitorhead have the right idea. If your kids is a good kid (and I'm sure he is), then rockhead is out of this one. But I must say, monitohead has much more patience than I. I would follow his advise but once in front of the accused I might make a bad decision. You know, like bully him around and see if he likes it. I'm a big guy serving for the ARMY. So you know I would do some serious damage to anyone. But a child has no defense. If the staff was in the wrong you should takes the steps to correct it now so that it won't happen to some other kid down the road.

some dogs just aren't barkers, whereas others you just can't shut the little ******** up! Also depends on the breed of dog too.  I have a staffordshire terrier, he's nearly 5 and he never barks.  The only time he does is when I turn the hose on and he runs under the running water.  He loves it, but he's very much a dumbarse of a dog.  And that's why I love him so!!

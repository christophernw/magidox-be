to over come this guilt you need to examine how important that believe is to you. if its that important the judment of others around you won't matter and you shouldn't feel guilty for what you believe. though sourounded by people that don't belive in my christianity i don't let that affect me. i know in whom i believe in. i know your a different religion but i hope it helps.------VJ

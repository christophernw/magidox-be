stop worrying about it so much, you either have the personality that makes people want to hang out with you or you dont.  Just find the group of people that you do fit in with naturally (whether it be band, chorus, sports, etc) and go with that.  Whatever you do, dont try so hard...it just makes people think youre awkward.

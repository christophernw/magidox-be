Men and women are not taking the vows that are said before God seriously! It is stated that for better and for worse until death do us part---many people are missing it somewhere. They move on to the next person and most likely will end up divorced again! Unless there is something horribly wrong in the relationship I think it is better to pray about and let God lead you to the right way!

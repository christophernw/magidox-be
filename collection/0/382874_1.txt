It's not important--it's just convenient.  Protein bars are typically comprised of a number of key nutrients packaged together in candy-bar form for ease of consumption.  And since many of them actually are fairly nutritionally sound, many use them as a meal replacement.. . If you decide to try them, be sure to check them out carefully.  Not all protein bars are alike.  Again, many of them are quality products that are high in protein, complex carbohydrates and fiber and low in fat.  But others are loaded with fat and sugar and are simply packaged as "energy" bars or somthing similar.  They are nothing more than candy bars in fancy wrappers with fancy prices to go along with them.

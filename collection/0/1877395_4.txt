You might as well ask why are humans upright while chimps knuckle walk, or why they're covered with body hair and we aren't so much. Over the 100's of thousands of years, we have changed physically and mentally in many ways. Although 99% of our DNA is still the same as a chimps, that 1% has diverged far enough so that we are really an entirely different species at this point.

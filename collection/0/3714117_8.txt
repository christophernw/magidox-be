I think its depends on where you live eg. pub comes from the word public and bar is the extension to the phrase to mean public bar,so in that case a public bar is avalible for children to be in but only accompanied by a parent.. people say I'm off to the pub in short term rather than saying I'm off to the public bar.. Or when they are there they could say, I'm going to the bar,anyone need a drink?. Public bars have to have food avalible to purchase.. and I guess origanilly bars you didn't but well at least where I live they have to have food to purchase in some form and the only one's that can get away with it are Clubs,Night Clubs.

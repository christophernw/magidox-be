being a recovering alcho the best advice is don't drink.but if you must , don't mix grain & grape ( don't drink wine & beer). you'll wind up embarrasingly smashed & the next day your head will feel like it's got an axe in it. make the last drink of the night water , at least 1 litre  , 2 litres if you can , alcyhole really badly dehydrates you - hence the hangover.. also keep up the borrocca or vitamin b 'cause alcyhole robs that too. cheers:. paul  :-}

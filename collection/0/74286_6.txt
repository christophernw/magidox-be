Absolutely right, the nation should be given the chance to publicly acknowledge the return of the coffins and mourn. Instead, the corpses are spirited away under cover, as if their death is shameful and the by-product of a shameful war ... oh, hang on, I've worked it out.  Yep, the gov. is ashamed of killing its servicemen in a war they should have never started.

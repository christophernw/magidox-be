do you know why the Jews wandered for 40 years in the desert until they got to the promised land?  They didn't have the mentality of a free people to govern themselves, so Moses and God wanted to see a new generation that would comprehend this.  Same answer for Iraq,  Iraqi people don't understand what democracy means and they won't rise above the mullahs in their mosks who control these "poor things" to believe that the USA is a big infidel, a Satan who wants to destroy their religionand grab the oil,  To succeed you need a partnership a true one between the people, which unfortunately we don't have.

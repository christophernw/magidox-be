Well, not really. I'm just confused as to why you would think cleaning a grated cage is better than having a litter-trained bunny. Grated cages are actually bad for rabbits. It's bad for their hocks and they can get their feet stuck in the grates. This could cause injury if they try to get themselves out.  . . This was listed on House Rabbit Society's website:. Is it OK to keep my rabbit in a cage with a wire floor?. Rabbits were not designed to live on wire floors--they're hard on their feet (which have no pads on the, like cats or dogs). If you must use a cage with a wire floor, you need to provide your rabbit with a resting board or rug for her to sit on, otherwise she will spend all of her time in her litterbox. . You can find cages with slatted plastic floors, which are more comfortable, or you can use a solid floor. As long as your rabbit has a litterbox in the corner that he chooses as his bathroom, there shouldn't be much of a mess to clean up.. . . Once a bunny is trained, their trained.  He's going to go to that corner to pee everytime and you really can't stop it. My advice; see the grated cage and go back to one w/ a floor and a corner litter box.. .

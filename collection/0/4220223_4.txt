I am an atheist, but born as a Buddhist. here we view cremation only as an option for disposing of dead bodies. However, Buddhists cremate (including lord Buddha - founder of religion)rather than bury as they are not believers of Resurrection. This applies to Hindu (Hindi)religion too. In fact it is the most preferred method in India and burials are mainly performed if there are financial or legal restrictions.

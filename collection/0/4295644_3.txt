Try crunches.  Go halfway up, stop for a second and continue the rest of the way.  Also, when you do crunches, pick your leg up and touch your elbow with the opposite knee.  I have done this every day for quite a while and I was told it made a difference, I didn't notice it though.  You have to be patient.  It won't happen over night.

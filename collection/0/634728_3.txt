look why dont u try to go to a mental health insitute ,look cats do thinks for alot of reasons for example u arent cleaning his litterbox ,or the litter box isnt big enough  and the reason which i think it is doing that is cause maybe u have the litter box in a visualble place and cats like us like privacy  so change it from the place u have it to another place more secretive hidden but show him were it is and never put litter box near his food u wouldnt like to eat were u shit right and take the shit that he crapped and put it in the litter box remember change the litter box from were it is at to a more hidden place and dont put the food near and if it keeps on happening understand when pets do things that they dont actually do is there way to telling u something remember they dont talk like we do and dont u dare mistreat the cat cause it is a part of the family and that is an abuse and it shows how little u are of a man

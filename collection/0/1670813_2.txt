Lots of reasons.  We need the trees and plants for oxygen first of all.  Also, we get things made of paper and wood from the forest. Lots of critters also live there and we need them too. (ex. deer for meat, etc.)  Basically it's a natural resource because the forest is not manmade.  It's a resource because we use the things that grow/live there to make the things we need.  It's important because without those things (especially the oxygen) our standard of living would not be the same.

true speaking in tongues is a gift of the spirit. . speaking in tongues is not the babbling idiocy that born agains participate in.. true speaking in tongues or as it is properly called the gift of tongues is speaking in an actual language (that you do not know and cannot understand) but what you are trying to say is easily understood by the native speakers of that language. it is usually accompanied by the gift of decerning of tongues which allows you to under stand another language as though it were your native tongue.. . these gifts are experienced by very few on the earth today. among them are LDS missionaries on foreign missions for the LDS church. they learn languages within 3 to 6 months then teach the gospel in those languages for another year and a half.

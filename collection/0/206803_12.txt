Now that wasn't very nice.. . Some folks are overweight due to physiological problems and can't help it.  Unless you've walked in their shoes, don't go throwing stones (I am not overweight BTW).  Perhaps the way certain people dress has nothing to do with their size.. Short answer:  try not to be so judgmental.  There are probably people asking "why" on something about YOU!

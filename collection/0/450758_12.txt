cats like to communicate with people and other animals just as the same as we do. If you pay attention to the tone of their meow, if you can decipher what the tone is then you can almost tell what they are trying to tell you... Their expressions on their face and the way they move their tails and ears are also a form of expression to.  Next time your cat meows, meow back at it... maybe it'll start a meowing conversation with you.. cats like it when you try to talk thier language too.

If the roads are closed, surely there'll be other students with the same problem. The teachers must know it's not your fault. Can you phone the school, or get someone older to do it for you, and explain the situation ? In fact, why not email the school and get your homework by email ? It just can't be helped, so don't spend your time worrying about it. Enjoy your trip

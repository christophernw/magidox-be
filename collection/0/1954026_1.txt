You need to start practicing breath control when you run try to use a pattern and consentrate on taking the same breath in and releasing it out fully. you breath in fresh air and breath out air that lacks oxygen so if you are brathing fast you suck in the air with no oxygen this causes cramps also.  if you drink soda and eat greasy foods thats probably the first thing that you should work on ok.

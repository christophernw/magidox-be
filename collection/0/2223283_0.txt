Well, now that it's past....think about what happened right before you had the attack.  Did you argue with someone, break up, do badly on a test?  Something always happens to bring it on.  You have to figure out what it was and learn not to freak over it again.  Everyone has bad things happen to them.  But not everyone reacts badly to it.

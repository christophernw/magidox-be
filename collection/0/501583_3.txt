"Neutral" disconnects the transmission from the engine so you can start the car, and then apply power, without worrying about the car lurching forward.  It's handy for both manual and automatic transmissions--for manuals the point is obvious, but for automatics it gives you another gear to start the car in (besides "park") and a great way to save your transmission at long stop lights.

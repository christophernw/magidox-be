Symptoms of genital herpes are almost identical to the cold sores you can get on your mouth.  Within a day or so of infection, painful blisters will form on the surface of the skin and ooze for a day or two before scabbing over.  In this state the disease is highly contageous and can be passed on to your sexual partner.  You will need to be treated by a doctor.

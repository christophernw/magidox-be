He follows a dream with the best of intentions (for love), but this love blinds him to reality (Daisy will never truly love him).  This inability to see the truth causes him to act in ways that are ultimately self-destructive (risking his life and dignity to save Daisy with the delusional hope of living happily ever after with her).  Unfortunatley, she is self-absorbed and basically using Gastby and his undying (well, until he actually dies) love as a diversion and as a conventient way to get back at her jerk of a cheating husband.

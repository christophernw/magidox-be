Don't be shy. Do what you have to do. Start a discussion and in a friendly tone, acknowledge the ideas of the other person and then explain why you disagree. Approach in a logical but friendly manner. Some people don't like to be disagreed with because it hurts their ego and they are afraid of being wrong. Just say that they might be right from one perspective but you have a different perspective about the matter.

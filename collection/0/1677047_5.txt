you know what, you're not alone. many people have acne problem too. maybe you always touch your face? or is it in the food you eat? my dermatologist once said the a lot of B vitamins can cause pimple breakout. maybe you have too much B vitamins. If yes, then switch to a lower B vitamin multivitamin. . . what exaclty is your skin type? is it dry or oily? If you're oily, don't use moisturizer. It will only add up to your pimples. . . What caused my pimples I guess is also because of me touching my face all the time. Hands are dirty. . . Also, maybe your shampoo is not compatible to your face. SOmetimes, certain types of shampoos cause too much allergies. You know, most shampoos nowadays have many chemicals and are harsh. . . ALmost all shampoos also leave residue on your hair. SO when you're face attracts dust, these residue stick to your face, "sealing" the dust, and thus causing pimples. Maybe you can use is neutrogena. It's expensive though but it doe snot have residue. Be careful though. The Neutrogena anti-residue formula must be used only once a week. The other types of neutrogena can be used daily. . . hope this helps.

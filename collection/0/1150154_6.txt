When I worked at a health food cafe, we served a great iced coffee.  Make hot coffee, but make it triple strength.  When coffee is done brewing, add honey to sweeten.  Be sure to stir well.  Refrigerate coffee overnight.  Pour cold coffee over ice, 2/3 coffee to 1/3 milk.  This is good also with fresh whipped cream on top and cinnamon or chocolate crumbles.

If your shadow is produced by the sun, it gets bigger during the afternoon even if you don't "walk away from it": as the sun goes toward sunset, the angle between its rays and the soil becomes larger and larger, so in the triangle formed by your feet -your head - the point where the sun ray touching your head reaches the soil the side "your feet-point where the sun ray reaches the soil gets longer and longer.. . Instead, if your shadow is produced by an artificial light, it is always produce in the direction opposite to that of the light source. So, if you "walk away from it", you're in fact getting closer to the light source.. This again produces an angle between the light ray which touches your head and the floor which is larger than before; and so the explanation is similar to the one given above.

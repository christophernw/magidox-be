depends how old you are.  you need to show them you are responsible.  keep in good contact, keep the lines of communication open.  let them know where you will be and with who.  thats probably the key- the with who part- if they know your friends and they are responsible they will be more comfortable with you going in a group.  promise not to drive if you had been drinking and not get in a vehicle with someone whos been drinking.  most parents dont care if you call at 3am and need a ride!  they are just worried about your well being because bad things like date rape drugging happens more often than not as well as drinking related deaths.

A blank CD (or just about any CD) can hold up to 700 MB of data. When you convert the contents of a music or audio CD (the uncompressed music) to the MP3 format the files become smaller. MP3 files can be 10 times smaller (or more) in size when compared to the original audio track, depending on the quality and other settings you use when converting or "ripping" them from a music CD.

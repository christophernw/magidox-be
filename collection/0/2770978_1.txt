Phuket has its charm that you cannot find in Bali. There are a number of island resorts where you can stay with plenty of privacy. And great surroundings too. Options to head to Phang=nga or Krabi from Phuket, all by boat, and you have more beach and island resorts to try and explore. You just cannot do island hoping in Bali.

The Victory that you are speaking of is a victory over the second death which we deserve, but Jesus has paid for with His precious blood. He died for our sins past, present, and future. You should try to live a life with as little sin as you can, but you still have the sin nature - the difference between you if you are saved is that you realize that Christ died and paid for your sins. You should want to live a life for Christ, but you may not have the "victory" over sin that you want to have simply because the devil is daily tempting you with that sinful nature. Now if you have no guilt for living in sin, then you need to check your salvation. Once you are sure that you have accepted Christ as your personal Saviour, you have the true Victory. The rest of your life will be a struggle to live a life pleasing to Him - that ain't easy, and it is a way for the devil to make you think that you are losing the battle. God bless you

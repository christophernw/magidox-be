Problem children, as they are called, have only one big problem: Being born to their parents! Same children born and brought up by another family would not turn out to become problem children. Supernannies is just a new gimmick! They come out just as dog trainers and dog behaviourists come out to help owners who cannot control their dogs. It's not the dog's fault either but the owners! As for problem dogs, same as for problem child ... It's the owner/parent's fault (9 times out of 10). . So what should really happen is that, and no matter how rich parents are ... They should be amde to undergo pshychological assessments and take up parental classes why they like it or not, made to realise that to make a baby is the easiest thing in the world, so they haven;'t actually one anything special giving birth to their child who deserves to be brought up by them, properly! Instead of letting the rest of us suffer because parents cannot be bothered to do their job as in parenting.. . Sadly, and as you refer to council estates ... I do recall a few women telling me that their child benefit would increase with another baby at home!

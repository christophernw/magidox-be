Well you could raise some serious hell with a light saber but you might accidentally kill yourself with it if you're not a Jedi knight, plus somebody would probably just take it away from you eventually.. If you had a hover board you would also likely kill yourself the first time you took it on a big hill, or get squashed by a truck or something...we better just stick to the stuff we have, it's dangerous enough.

55.25 pounds difference. You can do this yourself. Go to Yahoo.com and type "Convert 12 pounds into ounces" and it will convert it for you. Convert everything to ounces, subtract and then convert back into pounds. Or do it the reverse. It's a really useful feature of yahoo that I just learned about.

I'm going to guess the problem was biting??. Do a lot of research of the different breeds out there, you can find a lot of info on the CKC site for Canada and the AKC site for the US. Some dogs are more gentle than others and surprisingly it is the larger breeds, labs, retrievers are very gently but they're big and hairy. Some of the little guys can be a bit of a handful so do choose carefully here, but, with good training some of them are great too. I prefer the labs and retrievers. Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers, sheesh the name is bigger than the dog. I have these guys and they are fantastic. A bit smaller than a golden but just as hairy I'm afraid.. After you pick a few breeds talk to a lot of breeders, some will give you a lot of good help, others not so much, you'll figure it out quick enough.. Try and narrow your choices to a bare few dogs. Then take all this info to your parents and show it to them.  Maybe if they see that some breeds can make good pets they'll give it another try.. You may want to look up some obedience classes as well. Good luck.

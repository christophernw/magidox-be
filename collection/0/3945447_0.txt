Thermal Cut Offs are small devices designed to protect against over-heating.. . The active component of a thermal cutoff is a fusible alloy surrounded by a special resin. Under normal operating temperatures the fusible alloy joins the two lead wires within the body of the cutoff. When the preset temperature of the cutoff is reached, the fusible alloy melts and with the aid of the special resin, complete cutoff is ensured.

Shivering during micturition (aka. urination) often occurs in men, but can also sometimes occur in women. It's not completely understood, and most of the knowledge people have of it is based on speculation and not real science. The term is post-micturition convulsion syndrome, and it happens near the end of peeing. It's probably a side effect of interactions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is usually responsible for fight-or-flight responses, but in the case of the urinary system, it's responsible for holding the flow of urine. The parasympathetic nervous system is known for "resting and digesting." In the urinary system, it's responsible for releasing urine.

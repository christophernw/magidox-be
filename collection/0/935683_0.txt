Get the Princeton Review book "Cracking the SAT" and but the big, thick 10 SAT book.. . But that's only step one.  The difference between people who buy the book and people who take the course is that the ones taking the course are forced to spend hours being exposed to the material.. . So you've got to work through that Princeton Review book like you were taking the course.  Spend an hour on each chapter.  The practice with the tests.  Then go back and re read the chapter.  . . You should do about 60 hours of work to prepare.  The cost will be low and you'll do great.

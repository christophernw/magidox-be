It's melanin, not melatonin.  Many anthropologists simply assume that whites migrated to higher latitudes in climates where there was less sun than at the Equator, and more snow.  Doesn't explain the eskimos does it?  . . The absence of melanin in the skin seems to cause the skin organ to be more sensitive to the Sun, which makes this race more sensitive and self-aware, due to the amount of attention they must pay to the environment.. . Why are we not all of the same color skin?  Why are we not all the same blood type?  Eye color?  Hair color?  It's one of those genetic things that demonstrate that there are subgroups within our species, as a result of complex combinations of genetic variables (not just one controlling gene).  It seems that some races simply evolved in isolation to each other for a while.  We don't know when or why just yet.

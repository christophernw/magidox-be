If you mean the seasonal type then there's all sorts of anti-histamines that will help tho not completely and even the non drowsy ones can make you feel abit tired in some people also a dry mouth. I still prefer the old fashioned 'Piriton' which does make you feel abit sleepy so I use it at night to get a decent sleep and to prevent my eyes getting glued up, stuck together in the morning.. Putting a wee blob of vaseline round your nostrils will catch alot of the pollen and other allergens before they cause problems. Also pads of cottonwool balls dipped in cold tea soothe the eyes.

Don't lean on her mouth, that can make her raise her head and go faster. Lean back, relax in the saddle, and move your hands with the reins, letting her head move freely, maybe taking back in a little half-halt every stride or two, then relax again.. . Also use big circles to slow her down- slowly spiral inwards into smaller circles to slow, then spiral out again and let her accelerate.

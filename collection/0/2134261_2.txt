Ahhh, the old evolution vs creation debate again.. . Tell me this, how do we know that a higher power didn't start with sea slime, then use whatever power they had to "evolve" the sea slime into a fish into a monkey into us?. Maybe the power was divine (God) or maybe the power was super advanced technology (Aliens).. . I guess that would be called Guided Evolution, or Evolution by Divine Control.

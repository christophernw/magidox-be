Some of the others almost got this one right, but not quite.  The root of the word is Schnit, which is German for cut.  A Schnitzel is a cutlet of meat.  It can be any meat, and it does not necessarily have to be breaded.  It is usually prepared by tenderizing it with a mallet and sauteeing it. As many already noted, the most common kind is Wiener Schnitzel, which gets its name from the city of Vienna (Wien, in German) where it originate, and it is typically made from veal, which is breaded and fried crisp.  Other kinds, however, are not necessary breaded and may be served with a gravy or cream sauce.

A personal home equity loan is when you take a loan against the value of your house.  For example, if you house is worth $100,000, and it has been fully paid off (i.e. no mortgage), then a bank will let you take a loan against that value (potentially up to $100,000 although it's rare you would get a loan for the full value).  If you can't/don't pay back the loan, then the bank essentially owns your house.

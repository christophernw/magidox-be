What you put in your body is the most important thing.  The ideal diet is fish and veggies and of course lots of whole grains.  Your body will absorb more from food then powder anyway.  I don't know what your routine is, but you have to shock the muscle and then let it rest.  I find doing light yoga on my rest days speeds up the recovery process.

Genesis.. In Genesis the origins of the universe are explained (and regardless of what some would say, the Bible has never been proven wrong by science), the reason the world is so messed up today is given, God's promise to fix this messed up world is made, and the way He's doing it it foreshadowed.. . Genesis is the foundation Book for the rest of the Bible, and the topics in the rest of the Bible can be found referenced in Genesis (not all of them directly, but at least in shadow form).. . It has poetry, war, sin, death, deceit, redemption, forgiveness, marriage, prayers, family disputes, revenge, greed, pride, lust, purity, birth, happiness, fulfilled promises, history, drama, intrigue, politics, highs and lows, riches-rags-to-riches stories.. And through it all, the main character (God) is showing His beauty, wisdom, goodness, grace, justice, and mercy to mankind.

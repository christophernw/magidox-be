In order to be born again, you must ask JESUS into your heart and repent of your sins.  It's as simple as that.. . Most born again believers are genuinely concerned about you having to go through the tribulation & your immortal soul being cast into hell on judgement day, when the LAMB's Book of Life is opened.  They want you to go to heaven and the truth is sometimes harsh.. . Please accept the Lord JESUS into your heart, be born again and avoid the agony of hell.. . GOD Bless you!

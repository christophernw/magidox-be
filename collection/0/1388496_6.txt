It will be bent and he will look whine/pull away/look at you when you touch it. My chocolate lab broke it by wagging it too much, and we eventually had to drug him for a few weeks to let it heal, because he kept wagging his tail and whacking walls, table legs, etc! He's so funny. Anyways, if you suspect it's broken, take him to the vet, because if it's serious and won't heal they may have to amputate his tail.

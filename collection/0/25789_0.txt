depending on the amount of drums and if the drums were submerged in water or not 5/8 steel banding would be just fine... you can put 3 bands toward the top, middle and bottom and them wrap in shrink wrap just to be on the safe side for safety issues... in case a band could break from the weather... I would try that first..

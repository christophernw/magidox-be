Most invaders to England, such as the Romans and later the Normans, arrived from the European mainland crossing the shortest distance to the south-eastern corner of England, i.e. Kent or Sussex. If your army starts from there and you want to move north you have to cross the Thames. It is logical to cross a river at the lowest point that a bridge can be built, thus securing the whole river basin, making easier access to all the land beyond (in this case, including Essex and East Anglia) and enabling a port to be set up near the sea. So London is basically in the most strategic location between the coast of south-east England and the North and Midlands.

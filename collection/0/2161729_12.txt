Due to the region where Jesus lived and died, it's really unlikely that he was white (with BLONDE hair). . Are you racist or something? Will you only be Christian if he was white? Really, why does it matter?. . Reponse to "addition":. You're an idiot. Jesus was the son of God - not God himself. And there is no FACT to the matter of his skin color you racist prick! :P

First things first.  The thermometer.  Outside, there's the sun.  Inside, there's not.  It really is as simple as that.  The equater (imaginary line around the center of the earth) is generally warmer than places say, at the artic and antartic poles.  Fish that come from closer to the equater need warmer water than fish that come from closer to the poles.  . As for Oxygen stuff.  In the ocean, tehre's alot of surface area, for one, this allows gas exchange; fish tanks have much less.  In the ocean, there's waves, etc., that cause disruption at the waters survace, which can help add oxygeb to the ocean, as well.  And most importantly, there's qUiTe a bit of plants in the ocean, which breathe out oxygen, and breathe in Carbon Dioxide.  . I think this'll clear up your question...

A single bulb circuit is cheaper to engineer and mass produce for a range of different models.. . You will probably find that most Fords only have 1 rear fog light as well- for the same reasons.. . In addition, this allows Ford to make asymmetric light clusters which reduces complication when ordering parts. Asymmetric light clusters can also be more space efficient, as they are one lens down on symmetrical light clusters.

I dream in the 1st person, but it always switches to 3rd person just before I wake up.  I don't think your dream state (1st/3rd person) is a diagnositic tool.. . If you are functioning okay with remembering things in the 3rd person, why worry?  You could ask a psychologist (not a psychiatrist) if this is indicative of something.

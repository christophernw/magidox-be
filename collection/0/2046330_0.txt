State-of-the-art means the most current, advanced state of a technology.  The phrase literally says what it means.  That 'state' (the condition) of the object is that of 'the art' (the field of study).  So, the current 'state' of 'the art', the most current things, are said to be '[reflective of] the state of the art' (though we leave the 'reflective of' part out)

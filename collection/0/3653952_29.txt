I think it's an ignorant way for the south to say that they have their own culture apart from the rest of the country. It's turned into more a racist flag than anything else. Kinda like the Conch Republic flag in Key West feels that they are separate from Florida. Most of the time it's people that lack common sense enough to realize that we are the UNITED States of America or lack the intelligence enough to even be able to read a history book to research the flag.

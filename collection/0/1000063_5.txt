It's complete bull.. The world is always going through warmer and cooler phases. Right now it's getting warmer because it's actually cooler than it was a long time ago. . The reason the Vikings were able to get to Greenland so easily is that the world was warmer then and there was less ice.. The world might be warming up a little bit but it's not your fault and nothing bad will come of it.

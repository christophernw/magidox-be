Every year thousands of babies are born.  Each one of them starts from the beginning and must learn from their OWN mistakes.  . . History repeats itself because the world is constantly accepting NEW people.. . If no babies were born the population would grow older and calmer.  80 year old people lose interest in war.  Naturally, that won't happen, so we're left with cycles of history.. . There will always be peace-lovers and there will always be guys who want to boss everybody else around.

Well the story I heard was:    when you sneeze your soul is in danger of leaving the body and the devil is just there waiting to grab it.... so if someone says God Bless you .. it protects your soul and the devil doesn't get it.      Too bad if there isn't anyone there to bless you.... I always play safe and bless myself.

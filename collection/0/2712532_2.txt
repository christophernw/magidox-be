The word "noon" is derived from the Latin word for NINTH. It was originally 9 hours after sunrise, which was the hottest part of the day.. The Romans usually had their lunch & rest at 3pm & it was called Noon.. As the industrial world developed, noon became the expression for when people "downed tools" to eat. So, noon, became the middle hour of the day.

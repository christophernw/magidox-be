Its the most disgusting habit ever!  In Scotland, on 23rd of March, there is a new law being passed which makes smoking illegal in public enclosed places.  Bars, resturants, offices, council buildings, everywhere.  I think its great!  . . The only downside is that, you get groups of smokers standing outside the premises, and you have to battle through a smoke cloud to get in.  Thats what is so disgusting!

That depends on your personality.  If you are someone who likes their alone time and enjoys having their own space then I would reccomend that.  If you like a little bit of a social atmosphere at home then get a roommmate.  You can still have the personal space of your room but also have someone there to talk to everyonce in awhile.  There are advantages either way, but it is really what you would feel most comfortable with.

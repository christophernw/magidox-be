Those symptoms come from bad diet and a sedentary lifestyle.  Although when they are that bad simply changing your diet will not immediately help. I strongly recommend you go to a naturopath that specializes in diet so that they can help you select a regimen of gut bacteria and vitamins that will help your digestion get back on track.. . It may also help to call local chiropractors to find a practitioner of Loomis Digestive Enzyme Therapy.

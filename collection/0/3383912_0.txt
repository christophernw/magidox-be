We get "Black & blue marks" when capillaries (the smallest blood vessels) are broken, such as with a forceful blow.  Venous blood (that is, the blood in veins) is dark and has a bluish-red appearance.  When the fragile venous capillaries are broken this dark blood seeps out under the outer layer of skin.  And that's why we get black & blue marks.

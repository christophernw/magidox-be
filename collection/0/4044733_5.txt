Question should be who are you and what do you want in life? I would rather live alone but that is because I feel the need to be alone and have space. Another so that no one bothers me I can bring a guy home, walk around naked etc. But if you feel the need to have company or someone to talk to or even maybe you are an only child then maybe you will feel the need to live with a roomate. Or you could get a pet, then when you feel in your heart that time is right you can get married or adopt or whatever you want next. If you feel you can establish an indipendancy go on.

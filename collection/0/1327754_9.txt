College education, which is actually indentured servitude, crushes the spirit of the few people smart enough to invent this new technology.  Since we are brainwashed to think that geniuses are freaks who enjoy being treated like slaves, we think that they can reach their full potential under this childish and insulting system.  There simply is no hope of anyone coming up with this technology until at least the highest IQs are paid a high salary and free tuition for their raw talent.  Asking them to sacrifice and they will not produce, no matter how much they lie to themselves that they don't mind not being paid for grades.

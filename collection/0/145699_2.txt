It's not just English...Almost all languages have some dialects, even if the language is only spoken in a relatively small area by a relatively small number of people. It's just the nature of languages - and a few hundred years ago, when communication and transportation were more limited, people didn't see people from other cities or countries as often and so developed their own linguistic quirks. Some of the quirks stuck around.

I am currently working on this same problem.  It is a family problem because my mother has the same condition.  Her toe has cleared up but it did take about 6 months. . The best thing is tea tree oil but it around the toe and I have a nail brush (like nail polish brush) and make sure the oil gets under the nail also.  You must do this consitantly other wise the fungus will begin growing again.. . I figure I have about another 4 months - the summer did me in though because it was ugly and I covered with nail polish which is not a good thing to do the darkness creates an atmosphere for it to grow worse. . I have also heard apple cider vingar but it just stinks way to bad

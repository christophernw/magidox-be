MY FIRST QUESTION TO YOU IS YOUR REFRIGERATOR SELF DEFROSTING? IF NOT OR IF SO THE FIRST THING I WOULD BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE TO DEFROST MY REFRIGERATOR WASH AND CLEAN IT WITH SOAP AND WATER ADDING SOME VINEGAR AS VINEGAR IS A NEUTRALLIZER AND WILL HELP TO GIVE A FRESH CLEAN SMELL THEN I WOULD GET A SMALL PLASTIC CONTAINER AND PUT BAKING SODA IN IT. AS BAKING SODA ABSORBS SMELSS OR ORDORS I BELIEVE YOU WILL FIND THIS TO YOUR SATISFACTIUON AND TASTE...

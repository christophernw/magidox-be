although she knows she should stop, you cannot make someone stop cutting themselves. that is up to the person doing it. when someone cuts themselves its because their emotional pain becomes to great that they feel they cannot handle it, so they cut themselves as a way to bring the pain to the surface and they feel they have control again. if she really wants to stop i would recommend counsling or some kind of program to help find the underlying cause of why she cuts herself. once the underlying cause is found, then she can start to heal and once she realizes why she cuts herself she will be able to stop doing it. she will feel in control of her emotional life if she knows what is causing the emotional pain and then it wont have to lead to physical pain.

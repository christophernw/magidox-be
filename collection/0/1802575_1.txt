Personally I have the conviction that paper is very patient and that a lot of the western theories or stories (history) really did not happen. They are just fairy tales and should be read that way.. . I saw a good movie on t.v. about that - unfortunately I cannot recall the title. It is about that many teachers in the werstern schooling system know a lot about what is really wrong with the society but instead of teaching children things they can do to improve the situation or help those children with problems they have they just continue to teach fairy tales and get paid for it because they are afraid they will become impopular with people they think are influential.. . Very good movie!!!!

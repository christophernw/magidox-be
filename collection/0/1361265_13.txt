Nothing like Labour and Conservative. Both Republican and Democrat leaders care more for power than what is good for the normal citizen. They should change their 'wonderful' electoral system to a European system. Currently it is almost impossible for a new party - with new ideas - to make any headway in the USA.. The Democrats and Republicans take turns to ruin America, and Americans continue electing them. Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush.. Same monkey, same tribe.

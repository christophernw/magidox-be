"In the military I was forced to stand at attention and salute the American Flag. ". . Riiiight, I bet they put a gun to your head too. Twisted your arm, did they? I do it by choice, you know, it's a freedom. Do you understand that?. . "I thought it stood for freedom and justice.". . It still does. Unfortunately some people are so weak minded that they let other ideas get in the way of the big picture. What politicians do today will never change my mind on what America is supposed to be all about. I love the flag and what it stands for. How can you let the actions of idiots change your mind for you?Can't you think for yourself?. . " Well, freedom is now history and justice only comes if you can buy it.". . That's bullshit and you know it.. . " So I no longer like the flag.". . Well I love it and you can't convince me otherwise. I do think for myself.. . " Besides, the one I have is made in China.". . Whose choice was it to buy that particular flag? Why did you buy it in the first place if you don't care about or like it? Did someone put a gun to your head again? Twist your arm? Stuff it in your mouth? What? That was YOUR choice, if you are displeased with it then you need to do something about it, don't come crying around here about it.

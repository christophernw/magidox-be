If we're talking about deuterium oxide, you can use a variant of distilling.  Deuterium oxide is slightly heavier than regular water (20 - 22 atomic mass units vs. 18 amu).  It has a slightly higher boiling point as well.  By taking a container of water and carefully adjusting the temperature, you can gradually remove the regular water from the container and increase the proportion of deuterium oxide remaining.

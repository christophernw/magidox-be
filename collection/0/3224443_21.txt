Nonsense! How can your heart "stop" for a second or half second if your reating heartbeat is less than 60 beats/minute?. People say that because they: . a) are supersititious b) haven't really thought about it.. it's just a habit for them. c) they have a touch of OC disorder d) they think it's the polite thing to do. It's like saying "bon appetit" or "have a nice day!"

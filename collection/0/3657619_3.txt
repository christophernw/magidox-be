Not really. Even if your not doing anything your still doing something. Example... you are sitting or standing or thinking, etc. Its impossible to do nothing. It's also impossible to think about nothing because even if your thinking about nothing your still thinking about something, that's nothing! I know it sounds like it makes no sense but it actually makes perfect sense. Think about it. It will give you something to do. Then you can tell who ever asked  you about what you are doing, that you are actually thinking about nothing!!!

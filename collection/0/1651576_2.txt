Because water (H2O) is a polar substance... meaning that the molecules are balanced... positives and negatives.. Oil, on the other hand, is a non-polar substance.. . If you follow the theory of "like dissolves like", a non-polar solute (oil) would NOT dissolve in a polar solvent (H2O).. . So... they don't dissolve in each other... they just kind of sit on top of each other.. . I hope that made sense!

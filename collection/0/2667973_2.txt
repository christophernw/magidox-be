Yep, the whine is his way of communicating for attention. This breed is very interactive, even if it's just rubbing them with your foot while you are at computer, they are truly living FOR you, so figure them in whenever you can, going along as sidekick on outings gives lots of reward to their needs also. DO NOT LEAVE IN CAR! Glad you asked!

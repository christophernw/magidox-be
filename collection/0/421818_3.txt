I LOVE it when people say it KILLS you!. . I want sources for that.  . . Actually.  The advantages are that it is said to calm you, to alleviate pain in people that cannot take pain medicines, and recreationally, it's a bit like getting drunk... a totally different feeling, but it makes your mind fuzzy and people think it is fun.. . The disadvantages are that you are taking smoke and tar into your lungs, just like smoking cigarettes.  And that it's illegal... in some countries.. . Many countries (USA not included of course) are de-criminalizing marijuana because there are no proven medical adverse effects besides the inhalation of toxins (as in cigs).. . How many times have you heard of someone coming home drunk and beating their family?  How many times have you heard of someone coming home stoned on marijuana and beating their family???. . Hm.

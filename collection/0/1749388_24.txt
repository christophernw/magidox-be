Well, considering that the same people who were responsible for 9/11 will be responsible for the next "attack" -by whom I mean Bush, Cheney, and the rest of the miltiary industrial complex- whatever happens will be whatever they want to happen, that's why they'll orchestrate another attack! What'll happen? My guess would be martial law and all that it entails, and that's just if we're lucky? Worst case scenario? Ever read "The Stand" by Stephen King? Except Bush, Cheney and all those responsible will be off in their secret bunkers or some other secret location safe and sound. Unless there's actually some justice left in the world, and they'll catch the virus or whatever along side the people whome they supposedly took oaths to defend!

Wetlands are Earth's water filters.  They clean the groundwater of bad stuff, and make the water good again.. . WE need wetlands!!!  No bad side to having them, aside from a few extra mosquitos (just get more bat-houses, to deal with that).. . Building on a wetland is a bad idea -- not only bad for the enviro, but typically unstable ground for a foundation.

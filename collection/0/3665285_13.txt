They cross over here illegal to make money.  They live 20 to a house to save costs to allow them to wire most of the money back to Mexico.  If they get caught and deported they are back in 3 months but now they have come back as a cousin (a new set of fake papers).  Most have no intention of staying here forever.  Make the money, get it out of the country, then they can go back home and live like kings on the money made here.

Don't "try" to give up. Instead, restrict and minimize.. . Smoke addicts use cigarettes whenver they feel lonely and unfulfilled. Just change your mind's direction. Tell yourself I will smoke only when I am "happy". Smoking should be done as a sign of celebration without guilt-trip. Life is not all about pleasure, we need to take a certain amount of pain too, to deserve that pleasure.

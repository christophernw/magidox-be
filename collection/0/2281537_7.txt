No, not at all-that is fantasy. The Romans persecuted the Christians because the Jews continually complained about them to the Roman authorities. It was a constant thorn in the side of the Roman leaders.. . Where did you hear such foolishness that Romulus was born of a virgin, and the Greeks had virgin births for pregnant daughters? Sounds like another "DaVinci Code" -like fantasy.

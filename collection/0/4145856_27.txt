Pure ignorance, my friend.  Most Americans wouldn't even know where Guatemala or Chile or Colombia are.  And it's in the same American Continent.  That's another issue.  Everybody from Alaska all the way down to Chile is AMERICAN because the continent is called AMERICA.  Most Americans are just not well educated in geography.

There is a compound in cranberry juice called Tannin which helps prevent the bacteria that causes bladder infections from clinging to the walls of the bladder.  Cranberry juice is actually more effective for the prevention of bladder infections since it doesn't actually kill the bacteria.  Your best bet to treat a bladder infection is to flush your system with water and to use cranberry juice as a preventative measure.

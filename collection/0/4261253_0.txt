clamp down on the bolt head if you can, if not, grab the back side of the shaft w/ vise grips and force it off.  If it's a big bolt, you might have to use a cheater pipe on your wrench to give you better leverage.  Odds are the bolt and nut are ruined, and you will have to replace them.  You might be able to file the treads straight, but once they are ruined enough to refuse to come off, they usually need to be replaced.

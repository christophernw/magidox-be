Easy.  Just call your agent and tell them you'd like to insure another car.   It won't necessarily be on the same policy, per se.  But it can still be on the same account and they can combine the premiums and divide it up so you can pay for both cars with just one payment.. You get a discount for having more than one car usually.  But better rate breaks can be had for having good credit, having a good driving record and for agreeing to also insure your home or apartment contents with the same company.  Ask about every discount you can.  You deserve it.

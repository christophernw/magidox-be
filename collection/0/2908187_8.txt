I would try calling a local PD. I work as a dispatcher for a police dept and as long as you have a name and date of birth, I have no problem giving that information out. If you find you do have a warrant. I always advise people to turn themselves in EARLY in the morning so that you can be processed and shipped over to court without having to stay in the cell for very long. If you are picked up...you could have to stay for a weekend or something like that.

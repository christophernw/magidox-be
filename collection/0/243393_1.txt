There are several good points raised.. . They do treat you like you are guilty until you are proven innocent.. . Whenever you have an agency that has that much power without anyone watching THEM, you get a risk for abuse of power.. . For example, the IRS audited the enemies of President Clinton.  This sort of selective attention is just wrong.

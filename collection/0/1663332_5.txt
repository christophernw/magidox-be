I think a lot of Christians behave just as, if not more fanaticly than Muslims, I know many followers of Islam (the most widely accepted religion in the world) and they are very understated....The Christians I know are pretty "rabid".....just read a few religion questions in here....you see any muslims ranting?   NO....You see any Christians foaming at the mouth?   YES

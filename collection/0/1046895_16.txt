Big difference!  Skin exposed to UV will get burned if it has insufficient melanin to protect it.  Melanin is natures sunscreen and is more abundant in black people than white people at birth.. . A tan is not a burn at all and is the result of the skin trying to protect itself from UV.  The UV triggers the cells defense, but they cannot produce melanin very fast in white people.  It black people melanin is produced almost as easily as sweat.. . If the skin cell does not have enough melanin and the exposure is too long, a burn will result.  The skin turns red several hours after exposure as the body's repair system floods the area with blood.. . Because a burn destroys the cells that would have normally produced melanin, a burn, when it heals, does not leave a tan.

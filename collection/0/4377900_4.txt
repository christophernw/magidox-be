So much for innocent until proven guilty!  Even his own FAMILY has already judged him guilty!  So much also for family love!  When I was a child family was about loving and supporting each other no matter what!  If he's rude, you cover that.  Explain proper behavior to him.  That should have been done when he was a KID!. . IF you want to exclude him, then have the guts to tell him so.  If you're going to stab someone in the back, do it honestly at least!

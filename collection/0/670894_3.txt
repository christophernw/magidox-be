For the most part, 100's of 1000's do it every day! There's just not enough Police to go around to enforce this Law!. Just think about how many work hours it would take to just enforce only 5% of these offenders! Even at that rate, nothing else would ever get done!. The simple fix would be for people to just not do it! But you and I both know that will never happen!

Unlike some of the other posters..I will stick with the question you asked. SOME Muslims feel that it is their duty to kill people who don't agree with their view point. SOME Muslims feel that the Koran is telling them to KILL the infidels/NON-Muslims. Some Muslim feel strongly that Israel should not be allowed to exist and they use terrorism to get their way. SOME Muslims feel that the "West" U.S.A, is polluting their way of life..that Americas influences is hurting young Muslim by teaching them unmoral values that is contrary to Muslim beliefs and morals.. I hope this answers your question.

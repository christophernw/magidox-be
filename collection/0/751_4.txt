yes, you can say the friggin' word "God" in school, it's not outlawed. So, quit yer whining and exaggerations. Your just pissed 'cause you can't convert the entire world to your lies. What you cannot do in PUBLIC schools is force other people to pray. People are allowed to pray anytime anywhere to any God they choose to so long as that prayer is not causing a problem. I suggest you actually read the Bill of Rights. It's creeps like you that want to take away the rights of Americans to NOT participate in yours or any other wacko's religion. So, don't go twisting it around like your a victim and you've been denied the right to worship as you choose. What a load of crap.

What make things funny to me is that it just is.  Example would be someone doing something totally unexpected such as making a citizen's arrest....to me although this is totally legal....who does them?  When I saw someone do a citizen's arrest on another individual for jaywalking I thought it was one of the most funniest things I had heard of in years.  I think a variety of things happen in life that are just funny, and maybe sometimes there is no particular reason as to why it may be funny--it just is..............

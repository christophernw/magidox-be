I am sitting in the same room with a Hindu professor. He says in Religion, it is important for the woman to follow the man, since the man is considered to be closer to God or any Deity.. However, due to Gandhi and his teachings, the laws say both can keep and thrive in his or her own religion. But, the children are expected to follow the Hindu religion. In India, the Muslims do not dominate, nor will the peoples appease the wants and wishes of Islam. Not my words, but those of a professor from India.

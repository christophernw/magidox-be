I hope this answers your question.. . The first time Satan appeared, he was in the form of a serpent in the Garden of Eden. Then later on in Isaiah it talks about Lucifer who was the highest angel who exalted himself as God and was an angel. Then in Job, he appears as an accuser. In the two last examples, he most likely was not a snake. I can't recall where it is in the Bible but the scriptures talk about Satan as being the most beautiful of all the angels. So, he is a manipulator to have caused 1/3 of the angels to follow him. . . So, I think the reason we don't know what he looks like is that Satan as a fallen angel has the ability to look like anything he probably wants to. A further allusion to this is where in the Bible it talks about that we can entertain angels unawares. Angels can take on human form. . . So, in a nutshell, the reason we don't know what Satan truly looks like is that he can change appearance.. . Also, I think another reason we don't see pictures of him is because it might start to become an idol. When we use a picture or a graphic as something that points us or reminds us of something, it's an icon. But when we start to revere or worship that object as being holy, it becomes an Idol. So, in light of that argument, I think that if we were to have pictures of Satan, there would be some people who would actually worship the picture!

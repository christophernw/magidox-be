Your insomnia may be due to lack of energy expenditure, over-consumption in daily calories, excess caffeine intake, alcohol, light factor, medications, etc. This is based on my past sleeping problems. Do a little more exercise during your day, avoid caffeine if you don't need it, avoid alcohol, wear an eye patch, eat lighter dinners, check meds if on any, .... . If all fails, use Benadryl pills as your solution, but try it on a weekend that has no agenda plans because it may knock you out for quite some time. Don't use if you don't intend to get at least 8 hrs of sleep. (1 pill)

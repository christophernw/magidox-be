There are actually 4 things required for combustion: heat, fuel, oxygen, and a chemical chain reaction. In firefighting we call this the fire tetrahedron... now by removing any one of the 4 things listed above, you halt the combustion process. Now by putting water on certain things, it can have a couple of effects. it either removes heat, or removes oxygen, depending on your source of combustion... now on certain things putting water on them will actually increase the combustion process...

WOW...I didn't know we could ASK and ANSWER the questions...so why do you want to ask a question if you already have your answer?...I do believe that Catholics are Christians because of WHO they believe in rather or not I agree with their tenant is not an issue. But to answer you about praying to saints that have gone on before us ,,show me where that is biblical...anywhere at all..Jesus is the one who intercedes to God for us, because he is the one who took the punishment for our sin. No where in the bible does it say to pray to any of the "saints" the bible does however say pray FOR the saints (Eph 6:18) Mary was indeed blessed, and she was humble, the perfect mother to care for the Christ, but she can not answer prayers nor does she intercede to God in our behalf. Only Two can do that, The SPIRIT and the SON.

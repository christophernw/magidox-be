The fresher the egg, the harder to peel.  So, while you are having a hard time peeling them, they are fresh.  Older eggs will peel easier. . Oh, just a little help,  AFTER, the water starts to boil, add a bit of vinegar to the water.  EX: 6 eggs, 1 teaspoon.  Doesn't matter if it's wine, white, or cider, just don't use Balsamic. Stop simmering them, they must cook at a rapid boil, and don't add the eggs until the water is boiling.  (For fresh eggs, older eggs it doesn't matter when you put them in the water)

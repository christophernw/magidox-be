in simple terms , a tranceiver is an electronic device that can do two things , one recieve signals and the other send signals electronicaly! this may be by wire or wireless. most noted units were the C.B. radio! Now the most noted units are cell phones. A video sender takes a video signal ..processes the information and "transmits" that information to another reciever most likely attached to a vcr or vcd . i use a wireless video sender on my camcorder for recording remotely on a home powered recorder! saves battery life and the tape is usually better quality unless i connect directly to my computer and record directly to hard drive. hope that helps.

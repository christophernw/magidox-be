Not sure about your specific bike, but in general backfiring while decelerating is usually caused by changes in either the exhust system. If the exhust is opened up, like putting a new flow-through muffler on, then the gas mixture is actually sucked into the exhust and detonated there on deceleration.. . If not, then either the combustion chamber is fouled, may need to clean/replace your plugs. Or if your running 125 two-stroke, you may have to much oil in the fuel mixture and its built up too much carbon in the exhust, again detonating unburnt gas.

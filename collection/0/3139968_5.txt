you might try placing the container in a pot of boiling water and letting the soup reconstitute that way. or you can also dump the soup in a pot and heat on low, very slowly ... as it starts to gelatinize, add a bit of water and stir in with a fork (not a spoon, the fork breaks up the jellyness and lets the water mix in). you can add quite a bit of water to it this way, just do it a bit at a time. a lot of the water steams off as you cook, so it won't change the flavor of the soup.

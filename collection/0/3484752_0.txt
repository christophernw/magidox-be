The body has several metabolic filtering systems and the pancreas is one of them...like the good doctor in the post above said...quit drinking!  Alcohol intake is a biggie and can irritate the pancreas and cause extreme pain.  Drugs are another biggie.  In saying this, I must add that I have two friends who have had pancreatitis who do NOT drink or use drugs.  One has (had) a chronic problem, the other spent the better part of a year in and out of the hospital for pain control.  Her problem was a virus that affected her pancreas.  Pain control was the reason for her admissions.....she hasn't had the problem of pancreatitis for a couple of years.  My other friend died fom a huge MI....nothing considered due to pancreas.   Can I presume you are under a doctor's care if you have been diagnosed with an inflamed/swollen pancreas?  Listen to the advice of your physician and then follow that advice.  If you are doing any of the "don'ts", stop it and give your pancreas time to heal.

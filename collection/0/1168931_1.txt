Definitions of albedo on the Web:. .     * ratio of the amount of electromagnetic energy reflected by a surface to the amount of energy incident upon it.       http://tes.asu.edu/webdata/glossary.html. .     * reflectivity; the fraction of radiation striking a surface that is reflected by that surface..       http://www.pnl.gov/atmos_sciences/Cdw/Glossary.html. .     * Reflective power, specifically the fraction of incident radiation (as light) that is reflected by a surface or body (as the soil surface or a cloud)..       http://www.nrel.colostate.edu/projects/century5/reference/html/glossary.htm. . High albedo means that much of the incoming radiation is reflected (for example snow and ice); low albedo means that much of the incoming radiation is absorbed (for example water). Albedos commonly tend to be broadband ratios, usually referring either to the entire spectrum of solar radiation, or just to the visible portion. More precise work requires the use of spectral albedos, referenced to specific wavelengths. Visible albedos of natural surfaces range from low values of 0.04 for calm, deep water and overhead sun, to > 0.8 for fresh snow or thick clouds

This takes patience. its easiest to hold the treat over the dogs head while telling him/her to sit. A hand motion is great to go along with this. keep repeating it over and over, every day until your dog has it down pat. dont forget to give the treat to the dog for sitting when you tell it to! best of luck to you =]

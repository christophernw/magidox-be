We are here bc God put us here. He made us to worship him. This isn't the best way to put it but if you had the power to make anything wouldn't you want to make something amazing that would notice you and make you happy when it gives you glory? I would want whatever I make to make me happy. And no we are not here to await the "joy" of Judgement Day. On judgement day we will be separated the "sheep from the goats" our fam and friends may be the goats and not come to heaven with us. I think we do have a loving God bc he gives us free will to make a decision, animals choose by instinct, but we choose by what we feel is right and what we want. Oh and Jesus IS God. 3 in 1.

Residual stresses are caused when you deform a material, this is inherent in any machining operation, but to a lesser extent for lathe/milling, then for example cold-forming.. . When a material is deformed it is changed at the microstructure level; the grain structure becomes deformed. The heat treatment process called 'annealing' raises the temperature of the material to its critical temperature, at which the grain structure essentially resets itself. Then further heat treatments (such as quenching and tempering) can be performed to achieve the desired properties of the material.

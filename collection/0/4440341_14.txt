Never ever co-sign for anyone. my own father wouldn't co-sign for me when I bought a new car (I was a lot younger then). It wans't that I had bad credit either. . . You'll just have to tell your friend that you don't feel comfortable with that situation. Sometimes the truth hurts and it could possibly ruin your friendship but at least you won't be legally responsible if he screws up again.

I just didn't attend school the day they gave it, and never made it up.  My sister took it and recruiters were calling all the time.  My kids aren't in high school yet, but if that is how they do things, I would call the school and tell them my child is not taking it.  Verbal consent is just as credible than written when it comes to public school.

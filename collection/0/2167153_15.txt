Well dear, there's always  drinking pink champagne and eating strawberries in bed, but that isn't a really seriously gay thing to do.. . You have to flaunt it!. . I mean, you and your lover should tend the garden together, but making sure you have little bonsai trees, which you both lovely manicure and trim to an immaculate no.2 crop.. . The other thing is to have a young friend who comes around,  mincing elegantly down the road waving; at the same time carrying fresh flowers.. . You then sit outside with him sunbathing, and every time a good looking guy passes, your friend points and says, "Now that's what I call a man. He could ride me like a pony anytime!". . Honey....I KNOW.....it's all happened to me.. . Trust me!

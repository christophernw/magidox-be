While I do not plan on burning any flags, from any nation any time soon, I do love my counrty (I am American) and the things that have made this country a great place to live are based upon the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution and Amendments.  The freedoms of speech and expression preserve individual's rights, even to the point of burning a flag as a demonstration.  If they bought the flag, and are not burning it in a manner inconsistent with the law and public safety, they NEED to have that right.  And I need to have the right to explain my point of view to them without fear of reprisal.. . I know not every person in the world would agree with my statement about this country being a great place to live, that is my opinion based on what I know of other nations.  I am very thankful that I am allowed to express my opinion without fear of retribution or prosecution from any agency or government.

I can't answer as to whether or not you are doing permanent damage (I highly doubt it), but I can answer the reason that your vision goes blurry.  The same thing happens to me from time to time.  The muscle the pull my eyes inward (cross-eyed) are stronger than the ones that pull them outward.  When I relax too much, or strain my eye muscles for too long, my vision will go slightly blurry.  If your vision is taking forty minutes to correct itself, you should probably see your optimitrist.  Hope that was helpful!

I am not trying in anyway here to be rude , however; we see cat scratch damage all the time and have been exposed to many attempts to solve this issue of the cat scratching the leather.... NONE are completly successfull... You really only have 3 options. . 1.) get rid of the cat. 2.) declaw. 3.) get rid of the leather before it is ruined.. . If you Do not take this advice, it is a death sentence to your leather furniture.. Take it from a Pro .. .  http://www.mobileleatherservice.com/. . you can search this sight for some other great stuff about leather furniture...

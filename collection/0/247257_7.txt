The theory is the male swelling serves to block the uterus, thereby ensuring nothing drips out and ensuring she takes (becomes pregnant).   . .   To take it one species further:  Male cats have a barb on their organ, which scrapes the inside of the female, causing her to clench up for the same reason as above... no drips.. .   This is not a concern for people...guys tend to wilt upon completion, not swell.  :)

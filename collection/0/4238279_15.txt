madame, the state trooper is trained to minimize danger while stopping a violator.  How would you feel as a lone state trooper pulling someone over, then a friend of theirs pulls over also.  Would you feel a bit out gunned? It could have been another call full of thugs come to the rescue of their detained friend.  Cops cannot make exceptions even for you.  The cops was rude, for sure, but he was doing what he was trained to do.  Your presence clearly upset the balance of safety.  You can complain about his abusive language surely...............but try to understand.  Being a lone trooper today is very scary business....

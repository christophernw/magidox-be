I always ask this question to people... I have always known that as long as I have a personal relationship with God, and I feel I'm doing a good job at carrying out his will, that I could care less what people think of me. This includes my girlfriend, people within my church, the police, the pope, whoever. I don't feel the need to impress anyone, when I don't feel they are any greater than me in the eyes of God.

i think you are confusing between promiscutity and polygamy. men are allowed to have 4 wives in muslim religion, whereas, in hindu religion, second marriage is null and void if the first wife is alive. however, they were allowed to keep anga-vastra, that is, the other woman, taking into consideration the factor that men are never happy with one woman all the time.in a marriage, mutual faith and commitment is very crucial and of utmost importance. marriage gives legitimacy to the children, secures their future, according to law, even the woman who was the man's keep, can get a share in his property, also her children can inherit. some unfaithfulness is bound to be there, but it's mainly the bread-winner's role that the man performs, which gives him an edge over the woman. if she wants to sleep with different men, why marry? in order to keep the sanctity, the Home, future of children, she has to be faithful to her husband, otherwise the marriage would break in no time.

I have the same damn problem!!! I just turned 23 and my school says I am still not old enough to be considered independent!! They have a wack ass set of criteria that they follow and if you don't fit the profile then you are up the creek without a paddle!! It is said you must be married, an orphan, have been in the military or have been born before a certain date(this years date is January 1, 1983) To be considered independent. THERE IS NO WAY AROUND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PERIOD! I JUST TURNED 23, I AM POOR, MY PARENTS PAY FOR NOTHING AND I STILL CAN"T GET IT!!. you will not get that status until you fulfill one of the requirements period! There is no way around it trust me I have tried and I have asked and have been told so. The best thing you can do is go fill out a fasfa form that you get at the financial aid office. The form will be used to determine you ability to get other aid from your school like pell grants, and the BOGW(board of governors fee wavier) which can pay for you tuition for you(its what I have). Also try going to. www.fastweb.com. they have tons of scholarships and grants available.

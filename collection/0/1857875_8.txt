The same reason George W. Bush uses September 11th in every speech he gives: emotion gets the attention of the people way better than straight facts. And oh yeah, it's not JUST the liberals that are using only emotion. I distinctly recall the words "boring" used to describe Al Gore AND John Kerry and "emotion" doesn't seem to strike me as "boring." Maybe that's me though.

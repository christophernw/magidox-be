There really is no way to improve bad credit quickly.  You may be able to remove some of through the companies that charge a fee for helping you improve your credit but its never a quick fix.. Your credit score is based on the history of existing open accounts.  The range is usually 12-24 months used to determine your score and also taken into consideration is used credit versus unused credit (limits versus balance) can also give you a bankruptcy score).  Making your payments on time every month will generate the new history that is needed to bring you score up. Opening new credit is only a good idea if you are able to repay as expected.  But opening a loan that pays off and closes in a short period will not really help your credit in the long run.  A share secured credit card is proably a better bet.  Its a revolving account, therefore, technically if you keep it in good standing, it will remain open.  Hope this helps.

I think that it started many years ago when our country was more focused on God.  He was constanly involved in our lives.  We read the Bible in school and we honored God in almost everything we did.  I am 55 years old so it may seem like the world is moving forward, but I think things would be far better if we put God in more aspects of our lives.

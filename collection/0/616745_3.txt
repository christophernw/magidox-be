Well, I don't know about kids in the park.. . But most REALLY rich people are angry and stressed out because they have HUGE responsibilities and are surrounded with people trying to take advantage of them. . . And if they live some place like LA, everyone there with property just yell and scream and try to take advantage of each other to get what they want -- and sue, sue, sue, every chance they get !. . And then they carry on the tradition when they sell out and move to the sticks !!!

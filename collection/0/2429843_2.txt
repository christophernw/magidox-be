b/c they killed Jesus...they were God's chosen people...He bent over backwards to protect them no matter how much they took Him for granted and sinned against Him and built other idols, etc...and then they go and kill His Son...they betrayed God.... but just like the germans that were in league with hitler or the white people that had slaves no longer exist, those jews are long gone dead...people need to stop hating and judging a race b/c of it's past...that's why it's in the past...the actual people that committed those horrible things are dead...people need to let it go, but they don't b/c they think it's a free pass to get away with stuff they shouldn't.... so they use it to their advantage..."oh woe is me" and then people keep hating them for trying to use the past against us...a vicious cycle...

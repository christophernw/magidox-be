Loud upbeat music can make people more active, slow music will make them calmer. Bar workers get mad if music that livens the customers up at the end of the night is played! They want slow music for people to dance to - and relax to; it makes them easier to handle and get rid off. It's much easier emptying a bar full of people at the end of the night - if you've calmed them down first. Make them active and thirsty early - calm them down when it gets late. Only, idiots ignore that rule - then you get hyper-active drunks wanting to fight the world and the bar staff have the problems. The DJ - is getting his equipment kicked in - serves the idiot right!

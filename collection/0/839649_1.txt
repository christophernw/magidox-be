If you can do it then just take them out for a very long walk.  I have a miniture poodle and a HALF jack russel HALF chihuaua.  The only way to get them to calm down is take them out for a huge walk.  I am tired when I get home, but atleast they sleep ALL night long.  If you have a fenced in yard, or long cables that you could just let them out once and a while for an hour or two, then that works a little bit too.  Not as well as the walk, but my dogs will calm down after being outside for a while.. . Jack Russels and a lot of the small dogs are VERY hyper and its really hard to change.  When they get older they will start to calm down, but not for a while still.. . Have fun with them, play with them, that might work too.. . Katie

hi butterfly... you can find all this on the internet but for me I cook alot and your 22 pd turkey needs . 4 1/2 hrs at 350 and cover your bird with foil or a covered roasting pan and place either chicken broth or water in pan depending on how much gravy you want to make ..i use for that size 3 cps water because water will come from the turkey too and cook it with breast down so it stays really moist, the last hour of roasting flip the bird to roast the skin on breast , GOD bless your hands that prepare this meal...Laney

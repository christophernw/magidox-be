When all light (known as "White Light") is separated by a prism into the "Rainbow" spectrum of colors, it is BLUE LIGHT that you will find in the center of that spectrum. Blue light is the strongest of these color band wave lengths, so, therefore, when white light  emitted from the Sun filters its way through earth's atmosphere, it is blue that is filtered the least, and it is blue that comes through the strongest, that we see.

According to the AKC, it depends on the breed but generally a dog who has not been bread before will be more agressive, and also tends to 'hump' things. You can either breed him, or have it spayed or neutered. Spaying or neutering will prevent accidental breedings and may even prolong your dog's life. You shouldn't ever hit them with Newspapers or your hand though, becase to a dog, that can be abusive to their phyce, that can affect them in the long run. (Everytime they see your hand or a paper, they will think they are in trouble, and be scared.) I have been reaserching on this. Hope my info helps! Good luck!

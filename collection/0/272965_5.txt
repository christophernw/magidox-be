god didn't invent any evil, so small pox is not down 2 him.. mankind in his endeavour 2 better himself has damaged the earth, the animals and himself.. Sodom and Gomorrah, ring any bells?. why do u think he wiped out mankind with a flood?. mans activities and his refusal 2 live in harmony with this planet has made monsters out of the lowliest of bugs, parasites and created a world of pain.. with the aid of none other than Satan.

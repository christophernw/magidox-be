There are some tribes that are Sunni and Shiie but I don't think it could be possible to say who is Shiie and who is Sonni just by looking at them.. There are small differences in Rituals like the way they pray their daily prayer.. Usually Shiie and Sunnis have different gathering places so if someone wants to hurt a Shiie he can go to a Shiie mosque.

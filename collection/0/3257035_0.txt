if the prop is turning, it is being driven, if its being driven, it is producing thrust, so, unless you boat is otherwise held back, due to rope or grounded on the bottom, something is missing from the question.. if the prop is turning, when you remove the engine from the water, then its probably broken shear pin or slip clutch, and when under load, wont spin the prop.. . if the prop is turning, very slowly, that could be just due to the thru hub exhaust turning it, but it will be turning very slow.. . other than that, only thing i can think of, that may mean the prop is turning, but, not producing thrust would be a seriously deformed prop. but would be obviously deformd, as in blades flaattened out. dents or whatnot would still make the prop work, if not inefficiently and roughly. . . or, the prop and engine is just far to small for the boat. like putting a 4hp on a 40foot boat or something

Well, for one thing. I feel your pain about that stuff. Cause before I met my husband  I hardly had the guts to even say hi to him. I got over that by having a glass of ice water and I took a good deep breath and I told him everything that I adored about him. If I hadn't said those words I wouldn't have gotten merried and had my 5 month old! So try following my footsteps and you may wind up the same way. Second of all,try to talk to your dad and tell him how worried you are about him and his life! And finally, ask your teachers about giving your more time to do your work and that may help.. -Sarah

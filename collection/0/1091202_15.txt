When someone dies, you always remember them as you knew them when they were alive, so technically, you love their memory. Since I believe we have eternal life, I look forward to the day when we'll meet again, and I know I will love them just as much, probably more, than I did when we were here on earth. So, I don't think there is anything false about the love you have for someone who has passed on. It's just put on hold indefinitely.. . Besides, if, for instance, your grandma lives in Florida (she's retired) and you live in Vermont (you love the change of seasons and can't bear to leave), do you love your grandma any less just because neither of you have made the trip to visit each other in 3 years. I'm guessing not. You love her even when she is not there with you. What if poor grandma dies unexpectedly (shark attack), and you still haven't visited with her for 3 years. Nobody bothers to tell you until your Uncle Irvin calls you months later. "Didn't you know? How tragic!" Didn't you love her before you knew she was dead, even though she has been gone a while? Stop driving yourself crazy with philosophical questions. It's not worth it.

Like artists, politicians are often given more credit than they're due after they die.  . . A personal favorite of mine has always been FDR.  However, had I been alive in the '30's, I probably would have seen him as an idiot or a crook, the same way I view today's politicians.  However, FDR did contribute a lot to the people in a way that helped society in a terrible economic time.  It's thanks to him and his administration that we have some wonderful national parks and things, planned and built to provide work for the unemployed.

God has always spoken to prophets and they have in turn shared God's word.  That is what happened with the Ten Commandments.  That was not the only incident God spoke to prophets.  There was Adam, Noah, Abraham, Jesus, and many more.  So, you cannot choose to only follow certain teachings and not others (why do you believe the 10 commandments?).  Christ taught people and they (apostles) kept records.  Just because religions have taken the records and interpreted them in their own way doesn't mean there isn't some truth to them, especially the original records.  You seem confused. Good luck.

All of your questions are following the same theme and they continue to reflect an incorrect view of the world.. . For example, do you have any idea where the zero was invented/discovered?  Do you have any idea what math would be like without a zero?. . What do you mean by the word science?  If you mean simply being inquisitive and testing the world around you to find out what you can and can't do, then "science" originated with the emergence of the first intelligent life forms on the planet.  Through trial and error, these creatures lived their lives from day to day, learning what they needed to survive and gaining new knowledge every day from new things they tried to do (or get away with), often passing on this information to others of their kind in one way or another.. . If, however, you mean the modern scientific method, that of observing natural phenomena, formulating a hypothesis about it, testing that hypothesis with experiments, collecting data, and then theorizing about the phenomena based of the information you've gathered and the tests you've conducted, then true science originated separately with the Greeks and the Chinese -- both these cultures used what we now know as the scientific method to discover new ways of doing things, and how the world around them actually worked.. . Primarily from “Ask A Scientist.”

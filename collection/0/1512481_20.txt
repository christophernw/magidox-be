This is a difficult question to answer because this may stomp on some people's religion. Knowledge is something that is not comprimised by the person who says how it happened.We know for a fact that the sun revolves around the earth. We know for a fact that 2+2=4. .   When you believe something, you don't care what science, or history has taught us. For instance, we will talk about Jesus. No one actually has real proof that he did exist, or that he was the son of God. Now, I say this because no one really knows if these men (disciples) just compiled a bunch of stories together for the church and said it was God. However, we also don't know that He doesn't exist. Either side of this dispute could be wrong, therefore relgions are, until found otherwise, beliefs.

Talk to her, be there for her, and find the number to a help line that she can call. If her parents are really that bad, then she probably won't be able to get them to take her to a therapist, but that really would be the best course of action- try asking a school counselor to talk to her parents, and also to the girl.. . Believe me, the best thing to do is to make sure she has a friend to talk to and a professional to talk to. Yesterday it was one year since the last time I cut myself, and that's how I get through the tough times. :)

Buy "back" such as in your own? Or buy from someone else who's totalled theirs?. . Here in Ohio, if it's our own that we total, it's already ours, so you can do with it what you will (unless you still owe money on it--if that's the case, you should probably talk to the company who has your loan). . .  If it's someone else's, you can usually purchase it for junk price like at a junkyard or from the person themselves, but it's still going to be titled as "junk" or "totalled" and not driveable (even if it IS "driveable"). . . You could probably register it to drive after that if you would have it fixed to the point where it could pass an inspection and be titled as a regular car, but I can't say for sure on that part.

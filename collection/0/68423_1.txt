this will sound pretty weird but maybe there is something in your past that you can trace this "fetish" too. but if you don't want your son to have it then you have to stop. people don't realize this but there children look up to them as an example no matter what age. it has become more then just a fetish when you start needing them in bed with you it becomes obsession

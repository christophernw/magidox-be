Well, even though there is freedom of speech you can't allow anyone to say anything. Someone can get people to do illegal and / or violent things. If you use your freedom of speech in a bad way, you should be responsible for that. For instance I have freedom of speech to say to my friend "Man, it would be really nice if someone killed so and so" if my friend goes out to do the killing, should I be responsible for saying that? I think so. Or if I say "killing people is fun, everyone should kill people, and themselves!" well then  if I was seriously promoting this view in a book, or an article - I should be censored. It's not right to promote all views, regardless of their content.

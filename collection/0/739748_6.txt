In July 2004, the UN passed resolution 1556 which told the Sudanese government to disarm the Janjaweed militia and prosecute the leaders who had carried out human rights abuses.  It also threatened to consider further action if this was not carried out.. In September 2004, the UN Security Council passed 1564 declaring their "grave concern" that the Sudanese government had not complied with resolution 1556.. In November 2004, the UN Security Council passed resolution 1574 saying that it might consider "taking appropriate action against any party failing to fulfill its commitments."  It also called on the World Bank to provide developmental aid and debt relief the the Sudanese government who wa carrying out these atrocities.. . I could go on with the rest, but its pretty much the same.  The UN has basically shook they finger at the Sudan, promised them monitary rewards for stopping the genocide, and threatened to consider taking action to stop them.  Classic UN behavior in the face of real crisis.

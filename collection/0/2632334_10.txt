Instinct I suppose. A natural group of mammals move together, protecting the herd, and keeping forces both external and internal from hurting that group. . . Humans, at the basic level, want to survive just like all the other animals. So we keep our group alive by not killing it off internally.. . For any mammal, even humans, to kill another of our own species is detrimental because we then can not mate with that dead person and produce offspring.

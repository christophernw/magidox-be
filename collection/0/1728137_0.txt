I too have a GM product and this is what I have to do.. . Turn key to "On" but NOT starting, press your gas pedal to the floor three times.  This should reset your oil change light.. . If you are talking about your Oil Warning Light, aka "Dummy light" if its on, you are out, or nearly out of oil, so ADD oil!

Sight is the most important to me! My reason is based on a 2 minute thought as I read your question, actually faced in a situation where I had to choose I would have alot of question to determine what would fit in my life best.. . I choose sight because, with out it, I cant read, see my children, or see any thing for that matter. I think seeing is believing, and with out sight or hearing you may not have a grip on what is real or not, making life fairly lonely.. . Perhaps if you have sight, you can learn sign language, and of course read, so communication is possible. . You may even be able to find Doctors who can help you with the touching, or at least make it more bearable.. . I feel as if their is a alternative to many thing, but not sight. Seeing is some thing you want to do on your own, not with a Dog.

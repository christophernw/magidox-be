it is hard and getting harder to legally immigrate to the US but people want to come here so badly they cannot wait to go through channels and lotteries and quota counts and they just sneak in anyway they can. . . Why? Cause life is obviously crap where they live and even doing bad in the US is doing a lot better than best in a lot of places.  . . I say that if things are that bad shame on them for running here they should stay there and fix the mess they they have created or allowed.  If there wasn't such a wide difference in life styles and opportunities people would stay at home, but they shoud make their own homes better and stop sneaking into mine and tehn having hte nerve to make demands. They should have rounded up everyone at those protests and deported the lot of them.

Buy a panel puller tool at your local auto parts store for about $10. Behind the handle is a u shaped clip you can push off with the end of this tool. Check for a screw or two around the armrest and remove. Use the tool to pop out the panel fasteners by prying out at each location around panel and then lift up off the lip on the door. P.S this tool makes it SO MUCH EASIER

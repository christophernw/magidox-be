The background stars are fixed in space. So, the spacecraft picks out 3 of these stars (I am not sure of the actual number. It might be only 1) and uses these guide stars as reference for its orientation. Within the solar system, the spacecraft, using sophisticated computer programs, can tell its exact location by refencing the planets. Because the planets are not fixed in space, it requires some sophisticated mathematical calculations to determine its exact location.

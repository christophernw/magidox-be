Even though this country is turning more immoral everyday I still think it is still engrained enough in us not to hurt anyones feelings.  Eventhough when we are kids we all made fun of the fat ones or the ugly ones or the poor ones.  As we get older we tend (some more than others) to put those childish thing away.  Your friends on the other hand don't see you as fat.  They see you as thier friend.  Don't take it as empathy.  Also don't be swayed by them.  If you feel like you want to loose some weight than go right ahead.  Just don't feel pressured to do anything.  PS  Great job quitting smoking.  I'm still in that battle..............

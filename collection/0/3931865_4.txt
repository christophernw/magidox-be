Comprehensive is any accidental loss not involving a collision.  One example is a broken wind shield as a result of a pebble or rock being hurled at your wind shield from any source other than a collision, that would fall under comprehensive.  If the broken wind shield is broken as part a collision, then it would be covered under the collision.

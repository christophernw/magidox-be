It is a tropical fruit that is greenish yellow on the outside and orange inside with lots of black spongy seeds.  They are rated as one of the best fruits with the highest medicinal and nutritional values in the fruit kingdom.  The fruit cures certain sicknesses.  I have seen it in St. Lucia and have eaten it and it tastes great.  So juicy.

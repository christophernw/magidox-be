If you need to do deserts like cake, (this will sound weird, but) frost a cardboard box in the size and shape as the cake you want. the icing will harden and you can leave it out for ages. Do drinks by coloring schleac and adding some of those fish-tank rocks that are clear and shaped like ice...(but don't expect to ever be able to use the glasses again)

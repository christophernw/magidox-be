The main difference was slavery.  The north was against it and wanted the south to conform to their ways.  They wanted the states to unite.  The south didn't want to change their ways and evolve with city life.  I don't know what part of the country you are from but I'm from North Carolina.  Even now things have changed over the last 142 yrs but things are still different here than other parts of the country.  We are still behind times on everything.  We don't have the FAST pace lives like people from bigger cities.  We are still friendly to stranger we meet. We have Southern Hospitality.  I really think this is some of the things they were fighting for.  Things that we all in the south are proud to have carried on throughout the years.

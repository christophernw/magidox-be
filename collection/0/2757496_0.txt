First of all NOTHING can be taken off your credit history. ONLY derogatory accounts or other information that is erroneous.. . If this is the case you have to deal first with the creditors then the credit bureaus to clean it up. (I dont think this is the case for you). . EVERYTHING will stay on your report from 7-12 years depending on the type of derogatory account it is.EVEN if its pay off.. . For information on the time limits for derogatory accounts is this article http://jrealestate.blogspot.com/2005/12/how-long-will-collection-or-other.html This article talks about most derogatory accounts and how long they stay in your report.. . Another helpful article is this one http://jrealestate.blogspot.com/2005/12/credit-clinics-can-they-really-help.html which talks about those so called "credit clinics" that offer to fix your credit for $$. . I hope that helps

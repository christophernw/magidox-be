It is a very long and expensive process. It is expensive to those who have the money so just imagine the ones that live in poverty. Some people have to wait over 10 years just to get a permit (that is without a criminal record). Others go through the process and get denied just because they don't have enough money in the bank. You have to have money, Patience, and alot of time. Just to get started you have to spend about $2,000. In Mexico that is $20,000 pesos, and if you live in poverty well you can't do it.

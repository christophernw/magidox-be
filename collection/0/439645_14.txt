OUR MEN OUR THERE FOR YOUR FREEDOM, YOUR CHILDRENS, GRANDCHILDREN, AND TO MAKE SURE WHAT HAPPENED SEPT 11th, WILL NOT EVER HAPPEN AGAIN. BE PROUD AND HONOR OUR MEN AND WOMEN WHO FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY.   . .     I'M PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN, AND SUPPORT OUR MILITARY 100%, (MY HUSBAND RETIRED 22 yrs 3m.  But still trains our National Guard and Active Duty G.I'S on Bradley's). BE PROUD

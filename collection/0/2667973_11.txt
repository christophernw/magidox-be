Try the bell method for using the bathroom. Hang a bell near your door that you use for bathroom, but do not put it on your door (You do not want it to ring by accident). When it is bathroom time, literally pick up your dog's paw and make him hit the bell. Do it only for bathroom time. Normally dogs will start hitting the bell on their within one week.

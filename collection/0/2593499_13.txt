at one time blacks were mostly republicans.but majority switched,when     democrats..   represented  the laborers.. and union members... and the so called working man.  now a days..both parties.. have people of all walks of life...rich..poor..laborers.. upper management.  a number of blacks are returning to the republican party. ..it is hard to tell a democrat from a republican sometimes.

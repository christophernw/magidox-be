If you mean the UNI-verse meanign there is only one there wouldn't be anythign outside of it.  . If you believe that there are multiple "Universes" or Multi-verse it can have a large difference from how communication and exsistance works. Life could have taken a different course of development or none at all.  . If you are speaking in terms of parallel Universe then exsistance will be generally the same but living conditions will be different.

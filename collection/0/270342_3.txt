I work in auto insurance--go with a larger company, the small ones either charge more or you're not getting all the coverage you think you are.  larger vehicles are cheaper on insurance ( I know it doesn't make sense, but trust me.  I do this every day).  Keep your record clean, accident- and violation-wise.  Being married helps.  Have other business with the company, like Life or property insurance.

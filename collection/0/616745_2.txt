I've noticed that too. I think it's partly because rich people are aware that they're envied for their possessions.. As well,people are always asking them for money and trying to take advantage of them because they're rich. For example,an auto mechanic will usually charge more from someone who's called "Dr.John Smith" rather than "Mr.John. Smith" simply because he's a doctor and has to make a good living.As a result,they become paranoid and overly sensitive. about that sort of thing.

1) Factorize the number, so that it's factors are only prime numbers.. 2) Then, underline a pair of two same factors. If some factor is unpaired then, then the number is not a perfect square.. 3) Then, out of the underlined factors, take out only one factor.. 4) Multiply these taken-out factors. This will be the square root.. . EG.   Let us find the sqrt of 36.. We write all it's irreducible factors..  36 = 2*2*3*3. Then underline the pair of factors.. Here, we underline both the 2s and both the 3s.. Then we take out one of the underlined factors. So, we take out 2 &3. Then, multiply the taken-out numbers. So, then, we multiply 2 & 3. Therefore, the sqrt of 36 is 2*3 = 6

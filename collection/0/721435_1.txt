It depends.  The lawyer can't just withdraw if you are hurt by the withdrawal and don't have another attorney.   There are lots of details missing from your story -- why did he say he was withdrawing?  But otherwise it is not unethical to withdraw, and you haven't said you were prejudiced in any way.  That would be the key both for ethics violations and for malpractice.

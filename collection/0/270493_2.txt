It doesn't discredit anything if everything is on the table. Many couples have great arrangements where one is Gay and the other is not. We all get what we want in life, and not everyone wants the same thing. On the other hand, if one is gay and decieves the other, that is not much of a marriage and can only lead to real pain for both.

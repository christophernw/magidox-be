Even though every hypothesis in some fields cannot be tested experimentally, Mathematical models and analysis of available data help test such hypotheses. One classic example is whether global warming is man-made or periodic cycling of climatic conditions. Though you can't prove how our world would look like, say 100 years from now, you can certainly use Mathematical models and accumulated data to predict one way or the other.

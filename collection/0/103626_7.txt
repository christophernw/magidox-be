Learn that Rotts have to be trained by a professional.  And I knwo this question is stemed from the idiots who have their dogs attacking people.  I own a rott and she has never attacked (or even growled) at anyone because she is companion level 3.  Most people who get that breed have no clue that they need to do this with the dog at 6 months of age.  They are like children.  Rais em good they will be great. Raise em bad they will be bad.

World of Warcraft. I like it becouse its brand new look of fantasy games. Everything is realistic, finaly i can move my hero wherever I want, do what I want, make friends, kill bad guys and win princess (not really but new gear...). Its not perfect but best fantasy mmorpg game nowadays. Many girlz like it so u can try. http://www.wow-europe.com/en/

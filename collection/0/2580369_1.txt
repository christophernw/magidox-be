IT IS ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY FOR YOU TO WAIT TO FILE THE 1040X. Yes you can easily file a 1040x to amend your return but you need to wait til you receive your refund (if you were getting any money back as of your previous return). If you did not have a refund coming and you paid then you must wait til your payment is accepted and clears the bank.. . If you do not wait you will have one agent checking one return and one checking another, and it will be all screwed up. Once your check or refund is processed and returned to you, then you may easily file the 1040x. i would probably wait til april 16. then the irs is usually done with the rush.. . hope this helps.

think of really really really tiny dots, or pixles on a computer. when we look at somthing one little dot will pick up on the color of that, and right beside that dot there is another dot that picks up on the brightness of that color. then everything is sent to your brian via the optic nerve and it flips it back over because the lense in your eye has allready flipped the picture to begin with.

It depends upon what the complaint is about.  A teacher?  Administrator?  Other staff member?  The rules of the high school?  If you have already taken your complaint to the Principal of the high school and do not feel that your issue is adequately resolved, the next step is the district office.  Call the superintendent's office (part of the school district office) and ask what the formal complaint procedure is.  It is surely something that requires you to put something in writing.  If they recommend a sit down conference that does not end in you formally documenting something in writing, then you are not filing a complaint - rather, you are involved in some type of mediation.  My guess is that you do not want to file a complaint about an entire high school, rather, you have specific individuals or policies that you have had issues with.  There are complaint procedures at the site and district level for problems with individual staff members.  If it is a policy issue, a meeting with the superintendent is a place to start (if you have already addressed the issue with the site administration), followed by bringing the issue to the attention of the school board.  Finally, you can address the issue with the county office of education.  Just like any business, the next level up will want to make sure you have exhausted your options at the next level down.  So, I would doubt that you could file a complaint at the county level if you have never addressed the issue with the high school administration.

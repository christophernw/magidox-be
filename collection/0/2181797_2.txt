Become an expert in some sort of collectible.  As we Baby Boomers mature, we find great pleasure in things we had as children, but those things tend to have slipped through our fingers.  People spend good money on reproductions of old dolls, and very, very good money on pristine specimens of the originals.  So it goes with toy trains, children's books, and everything that we had and let slip through our fingers.  Once you have become an expert, go to estate sales and buy what is a bargain, and sell it on your own web page or on eBay.

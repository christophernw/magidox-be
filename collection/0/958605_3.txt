How about your state's district attorney's office.  U do understand that u must have concrete proof beyond a shadow of a doubt of any allegations right????  Meaning nothing can be alleged, implied, or otherwise assumed.  You must be able to provide ample proof of your allegation, and sometimes this can be both time consuming and expensive.  If the da's office cannot help; ask them to refer u to who can....Also, this may sound like a long shot but Geraldo Rivera is always interested in cases such as yours, and if he is interested enough, he will help defray some of the costs.....Try him @ Geraldo@large.com....Best wishes

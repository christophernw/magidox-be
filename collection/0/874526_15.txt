You can quit.. you can do whatever you want. I often will hear people say - I have no choice!! Well, whatever it is - you always have a choice, maybe one or both of the options are stinky - but you have a choice, you can leave without notice; but it may or may not hurt your career later on down the road. . . If you want to keep them "on your side" try and at least give them one week's notice; then they can't really say anything. . .Talk to the people who offered you a new job - explain how you feel leaving the job abruptly like that. . .chances are the new employer will like hearing that you insist on giving the notice; because it may also reflect how you look to them if you just walk out. . .You may leave the new job thinking. . Is she gonna do that to us???. Think about it.  Think about the old employer -- then decide if you can afford to "burn that bridge"

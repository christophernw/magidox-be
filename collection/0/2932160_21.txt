She was the oldest sibling of three. The two brothers, although younger than her, always there to protect her. They had met in church and for the three years they dated, he never touched her – never even tried. Who could with those two brothers always hovering overhead like some vultures waiting to land and start tearing you apart. She was his goddess and he put her high on a pedestal. To him, she was pure, as pure as anyone could possibly get in this life anyway. He’d had enough of ‘easy’ girls and wanted her because he could not have her. When he asked her to marry him, she said ‘Yes’, but it took two years for her to do it.

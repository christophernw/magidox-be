I understand some of your arguments, even though IÂ´m pro choice. As a matter of fact I don't know if I would use that term in connection with abortion. You are right, freedom has its limitations and the baby is a seperate entity. My concern is for the child, when it grows up with a parent/parents that didn't want it in the first place. Then adopt, you will say. But I think it's pretty rough on a women to have to go through a pregnancy and labour to give her child away to someone else. Then keep it you'll say. But life is not that simple. A pregnancy will almost always make you feel a connection with the child, even though you're not equipped to take care of it after it's born. There is always a good reason why a woman chooses to have an abortion. Anyway a foetus of less than 3 months old is not a child, it is...a foetus, a potential for life. I've had an abortion and I didn't feel guilty because i didn't feel I was carrying a whole human being, but the potential for one. And speaking of potentials, you say that beautiful people could have been aborted, but they could just as well have been nasty people. The way we turn out has to do with the way we were brought up. And no, we wouldn't be here if our mothers had aborted us. But we wouldn't know. The foetus doesn't know if it has a right to live or not.

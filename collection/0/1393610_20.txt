Action and Inaction . Hoover thought that the NATURAL market forces would straighten itself out, which deepened the depression, Roosevelt sought action, the New Deal, Bank Holiday, etc., even though a lot of the New Deal was rules unconstitutional it did help put us back on the path to recovery.. . I think that the best thing Roosevelt did was WPA, which hired artists, musicians, etc., we are still seeing some of the murals and things that came out of the WPA to this day.. . I think we should have something like that now, not let the craffts and arts linger and wither on the vine.

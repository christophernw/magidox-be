If you are still single and just living with him, get out now and find someone that is more compatable.  Discuss your beliefs and what you feel you want with anyone you want to make a life with and study the bible together with the agreement that you will accept whatever the bible says and then do it.  If he does not want to attend church with you now, what makes you think he will later if or when you got married or more into the relationship?

with my cats i fed them, and [1 at a time and let the other watch] put them in the litterbox and rubbed their tummies gently and they eventually went then i took their front paw and showed them how to cover it up. everyday after they ate i did this untill they eventually did it on thier own. itll take only about 2 or 3 times. u shouldnt have any accidents after that unless u move the litter box to another location.

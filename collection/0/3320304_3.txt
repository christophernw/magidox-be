1. try weekly partial water changes until the levels decrease (no more than 1/3 of the water, 1/4 is safer). 2. DO NOT OVERFEED!!! having worked at a petstore, i can tell you this is THE most common reason for excess ammonia and nitrates, which leads to a dirty tank and sick fish. if there is any food left over that your fish won't eat. scoop it out! . 3. try getting some live plants. they will use up the nitrates for their own growth, provide extra oxygen for your tank, hiding places to make the fish happier, and it'll make your aquarium look so much nicer!

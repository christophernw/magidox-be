Well, if you are competent and keep my WATER GLASS (or beverage glass) filled then perhaps you will get 20-25 percent. Otherwise, you may get a few pennies or nothing. As long as you are competent and at least know the menu (if I do not, many times I do) then you will get at a minimum 20 percent but I will not bow down to you this is my hard-earned money I am spending and I can choose to go elsewhere or I can even cook at home.

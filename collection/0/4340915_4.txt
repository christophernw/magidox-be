Oil companies call it "pricing for the market."  Prices at any station will always be the highest oil companies think the market will bear.  This means that if one of your gas stations less than 2 miles apart is located at a busier intersection, for example, or near a glitzy shopping mall, expect the prices to be always higher there.

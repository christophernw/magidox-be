Your stories are copyright protected under the law from the moment they are written. However, if you want to sue for infringement, you will need to register them with the copyright office. This costs $30 per work, and takes about 6 months from the time you send the form off to the Registrar of Copyrights. If you don't want to spend the money now, just wait until you need to sue someone and you can register right before you go to court.

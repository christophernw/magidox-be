"prince ali" have right.. example on what he said: is the transport of glucose from proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) in kidney.. this glucose if filtered from blood to urine since the pressure in blood is higher than it in glomerulus (where filtration occures in kidney) this type of transport is a passive transport, the glucose is absorbed from kidney tubules (PCT)by a transporter molecule and 1 atom of Na+ is filtered out (by Na+/Glucose Pump) this phenomenon is called couter transport since one molecule goes in and the other goes out to maintiin equilibrium, tyhis is an active transport exampl.. also Osmosis is a passive trasport. all transport phenomena that did not uses energy are so called passive transports.. also there is passive tranpost occuring with some bllod cemical carier proteins that conserves body energy, but all pasive transport carier transport only one molecule at a time.. while other active transport protein (need energy) transport more that 1 molecule at a time.. energy in the bodyis of many type:. -it's generated from high energy bond breakage, as ATP-> ADP+ P. Or GTP.. -another type of enrgy in the proton motive force eneregy. wich is generated by many protons (H+) and electrons that comes from NADH and FADH through Ubiquinon (Q). the difusion of (H+) through Pore of an active enzyme will be assembled as energy wich make some pumps active.. Just for notice: the way that water goes upward in a plant is not a transportation at all (neither active or passive) it's simply a cappilary action that may occures with water in any thin tube.

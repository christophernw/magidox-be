You just have to do your research for the product you want.  Sometimes the name brands actually do have the better quality and provide the most bang and reliability for your dollar.  For example, I'd put out a little more money for a portable DVD player made by panasonic or pioneer rather than a brand like say Mintek.  Just speaking from experience.

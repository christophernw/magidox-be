In my opinion, it is a sign that nobody is 100% confident about his/her religion. When he tries to convence other to embrace his/her religion he/she is achieving two goals:. 1- To think out loud and to see if his/her religion can really convence other people who are not biased by enviroenment.. 2- To feel that there are many people share his ideas, which means that those ideas are valid according to psychological rule that says the wider the idea is accepted the less doubt you have about it.

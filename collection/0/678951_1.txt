Re-read your HISTORY book.  Alcohol was banned in the U.S., called the Prohibition Era, and it created such a hugh black market, with gangs and the mafia running it.  Al Capone was a major player in the Chicago area.  The laws against marijuana have created the same thing, yet the Federal laws still exist, inexplicably.  People have different needs, wants, etc.  Some eat meat, some only vegetables.  Some drink soda, some drink alcohol.   Our Nation is founded on freedom of choice.  Your religious views are just that.  YOURS.  So, don't drink and smoke, and let the rest of us alone to do as we believe.  And what was Jesus drinking at the last supper?  WINE!!!

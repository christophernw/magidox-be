They aren't all I think about when I hear the term minority. Women, American Natives, Asians, Middle Easterners, the poor, and Seniors are just SOME of the ones I think of. I think it's because you are not as diversed in this area and you assume that Hispanics and Blacks are the the most mentioned minorities because you possibly are taught that or see that more often in your life than other people. There are tons of people who considered minorities for many different reasons, not necessarily race affiliated either. Perhaps you are linking the term minority with race.

Ask around and see if anyone you know has a pond, or a big tank and can take them on. Or if you have room in your yard, you could also take a big plastic Rubbermaid tote, dig a hole and put the tote in it. Add the water and the fish, and put some rocks around the edge to conceal the plastic and voila, you have your own fish pond.

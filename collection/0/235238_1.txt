I love public speaking. Being a professional control freak, it means that someone just gave me a fat check to talk to them about what I know, which is a massive ego boost, and because I know my subject well, speaking about it is like talking to a friend...it just comes out naturally.  . . I'm sure if I was asked to speak about something I didn't know about, or wasn't prepared for, I would be a nervous wreck.

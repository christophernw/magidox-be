I can only imagine that someone must have told you this and you took it out of context - but what do I know.  I would guess what they meant was that you are just slowing down the car after it took gas to get it up to the speed at which it was travelling?  A thing in motion wants to stay in motion.  To save gas, just let it keep going?  I don't know.  - this is just my humble opinion to try and sound smart.

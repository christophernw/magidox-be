I believe it is most important for the customer to feel like you give a crap about their experience with the company.  Compassion goes a long way.  As a waitress, even acting like I care that a person's steak is wrong helps.  They don't get angry as easily, are more satisfied with solutions offered, and generally don't demand discounts as often.

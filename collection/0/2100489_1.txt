Many laws and courts allow a certain amount of time after arrest to get a warrant (or arraignment). In most US courts, this is 48 hours, though it varies by state.. .

A warrant based on probable cause is required for an arrest from or search of a home (because of the special protections afforded homes), or to hold someone longer until arraignment.

Become interesting and people will find you. People always make the mistake of trying to find interesting popular people that's where you messed up interesting people aren't looking for boring normal lame people they want like minded people become one of those and its easy. Here's an idea take up sky diving. I haven't met anyone yet on the drop zone that wasn't worth talking to. I will also add that being well liked by people that only know you in passing is not my idea of friendship I would rather have one good friend then 1000 acquaintances

Fat is not unhealthy. Greasy fried foods are.. . If you have liver or gall bladder trouble, a doctor may put you (or should put you) on a low fat diet. But you still need fat in your diet. A good source of natural fat comes from nuts and veggies like avocadoes.  In this case, dairy products and fried foods are your worst enemy! . . But you didn't mention why you were seeing a doctor ... so I'm just guessing.

Why are we all arguing about a politician who isn't even running for office right now?. . secondly he did not call soldiers dumb.  He said that people who do not try hard at school and don't go to college wind up in the military.  This has been true for ages.  Take a look at the demographics about this and you will see he is speaking the truth.  Vietnam is a good example to get everyone started with.. . I would rather have our soldiers alive and being called "dumb" than dying for a needless cause any day of the week wouldn't you?. . DUMB OR DEATH!!?  COME ON PEOPLE THINK!!

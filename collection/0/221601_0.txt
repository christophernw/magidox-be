They do ask for them. OK, yes they are heritage...But the Brits dont expose them as theirs, they give all the credit to the Greeks. Besides there are so many marbles in Greece which are being destroyed by pollution and Greeks dont bother to preserve them.. People will not go to Britain to look at Greek marbles, they will visit Greece for that so Greece doesnt lose any tourism at all.. I am being more practical than ethical here, I know.... By the way I am Greek.

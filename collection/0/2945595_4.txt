If they are anything like the gerbils we used to have, then she will need to start making a nest.  Keep a lookout for her gathering up nest material, and spending most of her time in her chosen nesting area.  She won't like anyone else in her nest area, so watch out to see how she reacts to her mates entering her space, to see if she gets angry...and of course she will eat a lot more. . If she is pregnant, then for goodness sake don't try and pick up mum or the babies...even for just a quick cuddle, as she will become very upset and, sensing a threat to her litter, will probably kill them! Wait until they are a few weeks old, and are old enough to be re-homed before you play with them just to be on the safe side.. . Good luck!

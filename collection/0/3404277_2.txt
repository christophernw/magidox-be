In various religions, the pig is seen as a nasty, dirty animal. Pigs are know to eat anything.  It will even eat excrement from itself. I believe the Muslim religion says that a pig is part cat, rat, and dog. It is a mut of an animal that is unclean and ungodly. Even the Holy Bible (either the Old or New Test., I forget) makes reference to the pig as a unclean animal.

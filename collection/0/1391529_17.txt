The problem is that we as a society are not ready to pay the additional taxes that would be involved in creating a regulatory body to control that sort of thing. You'd have to pay for the government to issue licenses, investigate violations, and punish them. . . Not to mention, plenty of the people breeding dogs for viciousness would just get licenses to breed, unless you spent a LOT of money on regulating AND investigating the breeders.. . As long as the market is there for a dog bred to fight or be mean, someone will find a way to provide that.

Are you referring to movies?. If so, nudity generates more questions out of the young ones that may happen to be around.. "What's that?",  "How come I don't have 'this or that' ", "Why is 'this or that' so big?", etc.  . And God forbid, they're doing anything of a sexual nature....generating an even different round of questioning!  lol.. Violence is easier to explain.  Children understand hate.  And it can be a good opportunity to explain how one should NOT act.  And why.  They can see the consequences of violence.. Nudity and sexuality is more complex.

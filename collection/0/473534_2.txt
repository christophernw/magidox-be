OK sorry I know i am not a lady but....from the married man point of view in a second marriage. It is NOT for a woman to be sub servient to a man. It is a woman being subject to the vision God has given the man ..being a christian man If you ever heard of Juanita Bynum Weeks she outlines this in a message entitled proverbs 31 woman. A woman has a dynamic role in the marriage to and for the man. Consider the woman was created because God saw that man should not be left alone. So she has a great responsibility in the marriage.Not to obey the husband to death like Ananias and Sapphira in the book of Acts. But to be the backbone of the man. Through her God will birth the vision God has in store for the man and ultimately for them. His place and role in the marriage is to follow the example left by Jesus. OK so you say how can this be seeing that Jesus was never married...but Jesus does have a bride...the body of Christ the bride of Christ. So what did Jesus do for his bride...exactly he layed his life down for her and gave his life for her (even while she was yet in her sin) so that she could be complete and then be the help meet to the man God intended. Not a slave. a Queen to the King..Amen

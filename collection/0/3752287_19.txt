everyone only cares about themselves...we care about the right now. we care about getting richer, not about poverty or who cant afford medical care! you see people who are so rich and inthroweld with their own self promoting that they are to blind to really see the way this country is turning out...and that can all go back to our wonderful president George W. bush who tells us to basically ignore whats going on in other areas of the world and live in our own shelterd existence! And yet hes all up in everyone elses buisness with the patriot act! how fuckin hypicritical can one person be! i say fuck him and f!u#c&k^& his morals! the rich get richer and the poor gets poorer thats the way thingsare and thats the way its going to be for a long time! its truely sad to see people who are only worried about getting rich...you see all these sally struthers infomercials for ethopian kids who are starving to death and that same channel youll see some 200 lbs baby on montel its fuckin pathetic! obesity has become an epidemic here in america youd think some of those fat asses could send a little money to the ethopian kids and stop eating so god danm much!

aight . here goes a borin answer . e = enegry (potential energy stored in a mater). m = mass of the matter. c = veloctiy (not speed) of light. . now, get it, the energy is stored IN the the matter . ( ie the energy that can b derived from nuclear fission, . breakin the nucleus releases a lotta energy, thats how atom bomb works). . the amt of energy ( in joules) can be calculated by multiplyin the mass of the matter wid the velocity of light times two.. the vel of light , as we all know, is 3000000 km per sec.. . . this is totally practical.. this is actually how hydrogen bomb, atom bomb and the nuclear reacters work.. . p.s. c( vel of light) aka Einstein's Constant

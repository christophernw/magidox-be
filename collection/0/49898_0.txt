my glaciology teacher told me the 6 feet under thing originated in northern europe and they had the bury the bodies six feet under because that was the active margin of the thermokarst zone in the permafrost. In other words if they buried the bodies any shallower the bodies would be pushed up to the surface everytime spring came and ground expansion occured from the melting of the permafrost layer. Cant say if its true of not, but thats what he said and the process of ground upheaval is true.

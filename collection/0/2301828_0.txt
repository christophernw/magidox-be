Get a Sage stick and burn it while walking around the WHOLE house saying "I cleanse all evil from this house, may the evil energies leave, I cleanse you now and make this a house of white and pure" after go to a nature site and write this on some recyled paper "I am but a good soul on this Earth, Nature is forgiving, may the curse leave me now" Read it as you burn it under a Oak tree, burn it from a lit sage stick, then at night say "Thank you Earth element, I love nature". . It should work, but may take upto a month to take effect, do the house cleanse on a sunday and the nature self cleanse at full moon at midnight, if this doesnt work it is a very strong curse, in which case contact me.

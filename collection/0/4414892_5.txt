being a sensitive guy, one is so close to the other because in both situations you do not have the consent of the opposite sex for such activity, in wich one is helpless and the other is a perpetrator. Both cause mental,emotional and physical damage. if you don't undestand this and are clueless give it a try you being the victim by putting yourself in a situation, place and time where this can happen to you. then I would like to hear your respose how these are not so closely related!!!

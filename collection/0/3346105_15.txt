Not being accepted by God.  He is the one and only person that can save you and take you to heaven with him to live after death for eternity.  If he doesnt accept you, if you have sinned too much and not repented for your sins, then you are assuredly going to hell.  The beauty about God is, that he has already forgiven all of your sins.  You just have to be sorry for commiting them.

you have to go get some medicine, or it will go all over your whole body and keep increasing more day by day. . what you can do is find a local pharmacy, maybe like a small town pharmacy, go in, and talk to the pharmacist and tell them you need some antihelminthic medication, and tell him why, it might be a little embarassing, but you dont have to go to the doctor

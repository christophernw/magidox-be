well stars are in real more like our sun which gives heat and light, but y they have diff color id coz AS ALL THE STARS ARE NOT AT THE SAME DISTANCE FRM THE EARTH THE LIGHT WHICH TRAVELLS FRM THEM AND REACHES US GIVE THEm COLOR .. . LIKE white light has 7 colors in it and each has different wave lenght which means that their light travels on those wave lenghts, and secondly the air in our atmosphere water particles are suspended always and these light passing through them give different wave lenght wch gives us diff color

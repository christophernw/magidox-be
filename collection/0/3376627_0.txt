Because bias will lead to only showing one side of the facts, the side that helps your case. If you did a project saying fire is bad and only showed that fire burns and destroys, you put a bias against it. You didn't show that fire is good because it can replenish nature by destroying dead plant material and put nutrients back into the ground which is good. That is bias.

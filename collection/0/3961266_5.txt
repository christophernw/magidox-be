I'm sure you will get many replies telling you to wear glasses instead. But there may be some truth to it. Without seeing how you clean your hands and lenses it is difficult to pinpoint how the bacteria is getting into your eye. Just remember, your contacts have to be sterile and anything that touches them before they go in your eye should be sterile also.. . And are you sure it is pink eye (conjunctivitis)? You should see your opthamologist as soon as possible. It is difficult to self-diagnose eye problems. And the penalties for misdiagnosis are very high.

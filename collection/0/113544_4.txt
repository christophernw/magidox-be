The communists and the Jews decided to temper American thought with a little social engineering some years ago.  In an effort to totally weaken the moral character of the USA  while reducing the lot of its' citizenry to intellectual children the administration and media assisted with full vogor.  It worked marvelously.  The F.B.I. will be dispached to an American city at the mention of some teenager using the nortorious "N" word.  Now the administration can go to war by simply calling the head of a sovereign power "Evil" and history can be re written to suit the sensibilities and intellectual depth of females and anyone who does not conform is considered a "bad" person subject to near loss of voting privilege.. . Now to be ignorant of domestic and foreign political cause and effect, to lie with a smile to any person for fear of offending them with what might amount to a cogent thought and to faithfully ascribe to any pleasing/flattering rhetoric is the standard of conduct.  To do otherwise might imply some strength of character.  This, of course, will not do!...it might intimidate someone and they will be offended by possibly being accidentally forced to face reality.

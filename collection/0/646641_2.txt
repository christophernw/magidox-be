Christians are followers of Christ. Jesus never prayed to Mary or told His followers to pray to her. The saints according to the scriptures are the children of God. . Jesus never said that peter was the head of His church. Jesus Christ was the head of the church.(Catholics take the whole scripture in Matt 16:18 completely out of context)Peter never ever went to Rome. . . Most Catholics don't even know what they believe or why they believe it because it has been spoon fed to them by the priests. It is the doctrine of the Catholic Church that is false and is anything but Biblical . The pity of it all is that no one understands they are like sheep being led to the slaughter.. Catholics are by all means sincere. But they are like the church at Galatia. Check out Galatians Chapter 3. . .

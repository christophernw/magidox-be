You will get a clearer picture and better sound quality from a DVD than a VCR! you can also get "direct access" to any scene in a movie without having to rewind through a whole tape to see your favorite actor/actress at their most impressive. And DVDs save so much space on your shelves unlike a VCR with those clumsy tape that you have to rewind.

Technically speaking it is inferior in all aspects except 1, portability.. . If you want a portable game that has nearly the power of the PS2, then get the PSP.. If you want a power 3rd gen console, then get the X BOX 360.. . In terms of speed, graphics, storage, the two cannot compete and the X Box 360 wins.

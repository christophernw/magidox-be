To say how are you in English is rather formal and you will get an automatic response..  I prefer to say something like you look good today I like your hair, clothes, etc. or is something wrong you look sad, tired, etc. . . I used to work for a man that would reply I think I am doing OK, I am not in the hospital, not in jail, my wife loves me and I have a few dollars in my pocket.  It was a long response but it precluded the person every asking a perfunctory how are you again..

i also had this trouble and i realized that i was a pessimistic. my friends constantly pointed it out to me as well. Perhaps u are constantly down grading urself and never complimenting or accepting any compliments about u. this may be because u want reassurance and people to keep saying that "you're not that bad" or wateva, this i've been told is fishing for compliments. just accept urself and love what u do and who u are. also, learn to trust others and their opinions. i have, and the world looks alot brighter

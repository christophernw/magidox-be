Because the Palestinians want the land and the majority (not all, some Palestinians are christians), of them are muslim.  Muslims hate Jews and christians because when Mohammed tried to get the Jews and christians to accept him as a prophet, they rejected him, so he became angry and changed his tolerance teaching to kill the infidels.  Of course, America helping the Jews to return Israel didn't help much either, that land thing again.

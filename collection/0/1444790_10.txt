If it's not on any delicate tissue such as face, genitals you can use acetone (nail polish remover) but this could cause some burning or irritation - best way to administer it would be with a Q-Tip or something similar so you can get under the object - failing that you  need a trip to the ER.  I don't mean to be rude but the question that comes to mind is WHY?!!!

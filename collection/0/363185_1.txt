I don't know the history of Koch Oil, but it may be part of Koch Industries.  Koch industries is a private company.  Your grandfather may have had shares in the private company.  This is the link to the website, http://www.kochind.com/about/default.asp I would contact them and ask about the shares.. . Good luck.

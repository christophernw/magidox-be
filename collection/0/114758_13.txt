What it happens is that God, the Almighty, is the beginning and the End of the Creation. But you have free will and if you choose to reject God, you only choose your final, and this rejection has not need to be explicit, it's like a father that has a rebel teenager that reject's everything the old man try to teach him, if the teenager grows and learn from his errors then he will say 'my old dad was right', and his miscarriage will be forgiven, but if he lost himself, and he end in jail, the father has nothing to do about.. . Sex is something that has to be taken with responsibility,. written is in Genesis 2,24. . Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. . . When sex has love and responsibility is wonderful, in another way is miscarriage, this has nothing to do with the bible, but with ethics.

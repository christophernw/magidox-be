Most (MOST) Chis need c-sections. At least the proper sized ones do (below 6 pounds as the standard describes). Anyway a Cesarean section is the same in a dog as in a person. It's the surgical removal of the babies from the dam. If you have a bad presentation, a puppy gets stuck, or simply is too large to enter the canal, you need a c-section. If you don't get one, the bitc.h will die because the babies will die in her uterus and begin to decompose.

what makes you think its a race,. there is no rush to learn it all in one day. we are all yet ignorant ,you dont wake up one day and say gee i know it all ,. we learn while we are here and we continue to learn forever ,there is no rush and nom hurry you will learn that in time. dont think its a race that when you reach this or that age the race is won or lost ,you climb a hill ,then at the top you see if its good or not ,then you climb down again or climb the next hill . each time you reach the top you have a rest and choose what to do now. each hill gives a new vision you go with that or find another . there is no end to the visions and learnings you can and will find. you deal with adult one day at a time ,and even more easy one second to the next second. each second you can choose to smile or frown ,but the next second you can do any thing ,its not lived all at once but only one step at a time. the greatest journey begins with the first step but doesnt end till the last . then what well you may want to go home . or had so much fun you try another challange . and another but not all at onece but one step at a time. its what you learn from each step you call your own known proved life experience. make it good or bad but choose to live it one day at a time

I think it is because there are a lot of hormones in the meat we eat. Farmers feed their cows and chicken all kinds of stuff to bulk them up fast but not with muscle.  Also yellow fat is the way our body protects itself from toxin. Most toxin is stored in this fat to keep it away from vital organs. Yes we can get fat by eating extra calories, but we can't get rid of the fat from all the nasty chemicals in a bag of Cheetos until the body can  process the toxins.. . I also think the hormone thing is why there are so many little 8-9 year old girls in America getting their period way too early  (and why there are so many boys and young men lately who seem to be lacking testosterone)

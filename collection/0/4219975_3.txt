Not true, and u r very immature and narrow-minded. Many people are homeless because they physically or mentally incapable of working (ie mental illness). Our governements are more concerned about giving tax breaks to the rich than they are about putting programs in place to help those who cannot help themselves. But it's nice to see that there are still people as compassionate as you in this world.

We are most definitely NOT the only living things on earth that have them. It's as proven as the earth you stand on that everything from dogs to chimpanzees to birds to whales have some form of a conscience. Why we have them remains a mystery. An interesting fact though: No bear has ever been observed yawning, and it is widely believed that bears do not have any form of conscience. Maybe there's a connection.....?

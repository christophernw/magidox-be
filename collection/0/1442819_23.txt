Atheists don't believe in anything - besides "themselves.". . Agnostics believe in 'something' ~ however, they don't really put a description to God. It's sort of like believing in a nameless God, but not knowing what defines him/her.. . I'm neither Agnostic, nor Atheist. (Although, I use to be.). . God Bless.

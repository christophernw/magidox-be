I graduated in 2004 I was 21. It was not easy I had two jobs and lived on my own. But in Canada to get your grade 12 is free. I went to an adult Learning centre. that offed morning, afternoon, and evening classes. You go when it's best for you and your schedule, and with two children I think it would be best for you. Start by looking in your local phone book under school, and if there are none listed then I would think that your neighbourhood high school could get you in contact with the right people. It will not be easy, but if I can do it, so can you. There are three types certificates you can chose from your full grade 12 which takes the most time, but if you want to continue with your education it is the best. there is also the adult grad program, it takes less time then your full grade 12 but if all you want to do is take a dental assistance course then it will do just fine. And then there is a GED where they give you a book that you study from and then when you feel you are ready you go to a local high school and take a test. this one takes the least amount of time, but if you want to go to a post secondary institute, like collage or university you will have to take more courses.. . Hope I was helpful. Good luck!!

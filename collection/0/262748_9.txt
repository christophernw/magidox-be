Because if the good people had no evil to vanish, they would have no objectives in life and just let everything go. Society  has also part to blame for it. Just because a certain child is raised in a bad neighborhood or not rich, we discriminate against them and unleash anger in the not-so-fortunate ones and they end up showing hatrid towards the discriminators. Sometimes there even jealous and want to be like the discriminators. So they end up stealing to the top- if they make it that far.

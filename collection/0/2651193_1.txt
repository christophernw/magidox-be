Actually, a sonic boom is a pain in the butt if you are a civilian.  If a pilot flies too low and too fast, you won't just hear the boom, you will feel it and perhaps even suffer some form of property damage.  If you feel the boom, it will seem like a minor earthquake.  If you are too close, the sound could shatter glass, set off car alarms, even knock items off of shelves.. . Too avoid sonic boom but continue to fly at sonic speeds, the pilot must fly at a high altitude.

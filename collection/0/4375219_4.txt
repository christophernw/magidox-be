There's lots of different Christian understandings of fate...one of the most controversial minor doctrinal issues.  It ranges from hypercalvinism (anything and everything is preordained by God and freewill is a total myth) to armenianism (God doesn't really preordain anything and He doesn't know exactly what's going to happen He just knows every single possibility of what could happen) though the most biblically sound and the majority positions lie somewhere inbetween.

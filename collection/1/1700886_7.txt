My college days with travel ran 12 to 14 hours. This made me, sleepy tied and hungry.(I was not able to nap in the train, but was able to read and study on some trips).. . So my routine was, use rest room, drink water, unwind for 15 minute, eat supper, take rest , set alarm.. . Get up freshen up a little and hit the books but mainly do writing type work. Practise math, rewrite the notes neatly so I can read it without much efforts latter, as a science student I had 18 hours of practicals per week.. . But 1 day was short but I had NCC on that day and on Sunday also.. . You must do your best. Get little inventive, use holidays and Sundays wisely.

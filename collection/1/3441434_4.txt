I believe that the eyes cannot hide emotions.  That's why they're the windows to someone's soul they show the real feelings of a person. Also, the eyes show wear and tear, they can almost reflect a preson's life.  Their eyes have seen all that they have been through and will see their future, so you say their the windows into the soul. The eyes have seen ther person's best and worst and reveal their true feelings.

I have a VERY picky boyfriend who wouldn't eat anything but beef when I first met him, but I got him to start eating pork chops!!  I put them in a cassorole dish and cover them in cream of mushroom soup then bake on 350 for about 30-45 minutes depending on the thickness.  They come out very tender and juicy!!

i used to have them and you buy aldara cream and after every shower the skin is soft around the wart then you file it down with a nail file and then put the cream on and it should go away in 2-3 months. your lucky it tok me 7 years to figure out that treatment.. .                                 GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!

I don't know how to use them in a frame but if you put them in a vase with oil they will stay. Here's a really cute smow globe with the petals. Take a clean glass jar that has a lid, you can find one in the fridge or at your local $1 store they always have decorative ones. Take the lid and glue a figure or momento of some sort. set it to the side and let it dry. Put the flowers, you may have to cut them up a bit if its a small jar, in the jar and some sparly confetti and fill with a clear oil, or you can use distilled water, and make sure that you don't fill it all the way to the top, b/c when you screw the lid on, it will make the watercome out some if its too full. Then glue the jar to lid. Here is the website I found that on. I have done may of them and they are adorable. Good Luck!

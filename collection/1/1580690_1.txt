if all you know about your car's troubles is that it makes "funny sounds" I'd get someone else to look at it before putting oil in it.  Also, if you do need oil, you need to make sure you use the right amount (overfilling will hurt your engine) and the right viscosity.  If you mix one weight with another, the oil will not lubricate the way it is meant to.  Also, know if your car is using conventional or synthetic oil and try not to mix the two types.

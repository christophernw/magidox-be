Supernova (plural, supernovae) are relatively rare events, at least those that we can pick out with telescopes. On the other hand, lots of supernova remnants, frequently in the form of ring-like structures, have been photographed. Another nebula is formed, and many have been recorded, by aging stars that throw off massive amounts of surface material, again in the ring shape.

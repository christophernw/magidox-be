I guess the candidates we hae had are not appealing to the 18-35 audience. Really, the truth, who wants to hear Bush mispronounce so many words, names, and lie. In order, for the 18-35 audience to want to vote we expect more out of our candidate and we want somebody we can look up-to. I think that if there were better candidate that made us feel that we count the american 18-35 public would vote.

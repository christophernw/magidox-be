Innocence is a term that older people give to young children.  Because the term being an adjective, is speculative depanding on who is using it, there could be several different answers...I'll take a shot.. . Innocence is lost when you enter into adulthood.  When you're a child, you think anything is possible due to complete ignorance.  In some ways ignorance is a good thing.  You can still believe in Santa Claus, or that you might one day be able to fly if you think about it hard enough.. As we mature as people we learn the laws of physics, learn that Santa is not real, and gain a broader perspective of reality.  Innocence as we call it may be lost, but knowledge is gained.  Truth be told, the more knowledge you have, the more it leads you back to innocence.  There's a thought for you! :)

Technically, the platypus is not a "true" mammal -- it is a monotreme.  While it is hairy and warm-blooded and suckles its young like a mammal does, the fact that it lays eggs instead of bearing its young alive disqualifies it from "true" mammal status.  There is only one other monotreme in the world besides the platypus, and that's the echidna, or spiny anteater, which means that the echidna is not a "true" mammal either.  I do hope your son's science teacher makes this clear to his/her pupils!

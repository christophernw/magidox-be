At the current time we do not have enough troops to attack anyone else.  North Korea has one of the largest armies in the world, never mind that if we attacked them China might get involved and join the war against us.  And if you think the war in Iraq is bad a war with North Korea could easily cost us 1000 soldiers every 2 weeks or so instead of every year

Basically because you are better off being a Christian than anything else. Its like this: Lets pretend that you're a Christian and Im not. If you and I were on a plane that was crashing down from thousands of feet in the air and you had a parachute and I didnt. Who's better off? Well Jesus is the Parachute. He's a life saver like no one else.

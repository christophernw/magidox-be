in that year and model, i believe there is what they call a clock spring assy located UNDER the steering wheel.  if your not familiar with the job would advise letting an experianced mechanic do it.  you need a steering wheel puller and would advise a jeep maintaince manual(oem type) follow all instructions to the letter or you can get into very expensive trouble. the part is not cheap, but this unit also controls other items as well.(which will also fail as time goes by )  older style had a replaceable spring and was much cheaper and easier to repair...lot's of luck..........

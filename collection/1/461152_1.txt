when i was an art student i regulary had contextural studies which examined themes for example one week we might be looking at dada and surealism and seeing how dada especialy fitted into the post WW1 society and how it gave way to surrealism ( for example ) . . basicaly it is examining the history of your art in the context of the society at the time.

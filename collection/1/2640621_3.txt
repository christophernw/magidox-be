Your description of the noise could be any of several things that I can think of.  First is the catalytic converter is partially plugged.  Gives a loud "hissing sound from the tailpipe.  This increases with speed.  Also could be ac compressor or a belt tensioner doing this as well.  Bad head gasket could cause that sound to come out of the coolant tank with rpms up and the compression rising from engine speed.  Another "very odd" thing that affects Fords is a tear in the bellows of the idle speed motor.  If you can duplicate this without actually driving and it sounds like it is coming from the intake or air cleaner assembly somehow then a very small tear in the idle air speed control bellows will make this noise at certain rpms.  We have seen this on anything Ford that uses the standard 2 bolt mount idle speed motor assembly.  Lincolns, pickups, escorts, tempos, etc.  Drove us crazy on one before we realized what it was.  If that is your problem you can easily remove it and gently moving the bellows folds you can actually see a tear in them.  New idle air speed motor solves that problem.  As mentioned in other answers are wheel bearings, cv joints, and even the differential in the transmission.  Don't forget the silly stuff like the air deflector below the bumper being loose or some other part hanging that is catching the wind and making this noise, that is if only happens when the vehicle is in motion.   Regardless hope you find it easily.

I don't believe that stress is the main cause although it also contributes.. . I think it is the person's choice to snap easily. I have a short temper matched with an acting out behavior. meaning that I easily get pissed off with petty things and acts out my aggression to others. I do this because of its immediate effect- CONTROL AND AUTHORITY.. . Once a person snaps, everybody's attention is focused to him/her. They shut up and stop arguing or they just give way to the one angry to lessen the commotion. That is why I choose to loose my temper easily.. . I could choose not to have a short temper like when my dad is pissing me off yet I couldn't bulge since he wouldn't be giving me allowance if I did so.. . It's a matter of choice and its immediate rewards. Not stress.

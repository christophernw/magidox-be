the process of finding the derivative is called differentiation. The reverse process is integration. The two processes are the central concepts of calculus and are related via the fundamental theorem of calculus.. . For real-valued functions of a single real variable the derivative gives the slope of the tangent to the graph of the function at a point. In this way, derivatives can be used to determine many properties of the function, such as whether the function has a maximum or minimum.. . The concept of derivative can be extended to functions of more than one variable, to functions of complex variables and to many other cases.. . Differentiation has many applications throughout all numerate disciplines. For example, in physics, the derivative of the position of moving body will give its velocity (speed) and the second derivative of the body's position gives its acceleration.

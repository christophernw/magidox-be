i own a repair shop,and the grease in it gets cold and stiff and does not want to move very well you can go to a lighter type grease in it and this will help it ,but look in the owners manual first and see what there requirements are on  it, im sure it can be changed to a lighter type that wont be as stiff,good luck,i hope this help,s.

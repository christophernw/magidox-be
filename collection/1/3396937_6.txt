Put your dog on a leash, take her to the edge of the kitchen and put her in a sit.  Wave your hand slowly and steadily from one side of the door way to the other and say "curb, curb" in a slow and pleasant voice, make it like cuuuurrrb.  Then move away, if she crosses the line you have drawn, in a loud voice, say "NO" put her back in a sit and "curb" her again.  Repeat this process many times per day, she will get it pretty quickly.  Keep in mind, "curb" only means that she can't cross the line you have drawn, she can walk away if she needs or wants to.

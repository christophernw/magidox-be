This is mainly fishing for approval.  Deep down, most people want to be told that they are thin, attractive, smart, funny, etc..  If they complain that they are fat, the response is typically that they are indeed, thin, attractive, etc...  This is also why SOME people yo-yo in their weight.  When somebody loses significant weight, people compliment them on how good they look.  After a while, people are used to seeing them at that weight and the compliments stop coming.  Depression then sets in and the person is going back to their old habits...

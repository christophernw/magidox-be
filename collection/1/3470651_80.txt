i have the same problem you do, i even get shocked when I touch water.  I think it is just that we are so electric we shock everything.  I try to use a part of my arm or even the bottom of my shoe to close my car door toprevent that shock.  But when I get to a door knob, there it goes. My 1 year old is even a victim of my shocking.  I haven't tried this yet but maybe caring a static guard sheet and rubbing it on our hands could work.  Keep one in your pocket or even just on the passenger seat, so before you get out you can rub it on your hands and be static free.  Not to mention have a very fresh scent to you. (Ha)

I believe that if it was used in the show it would be protected under the copyright of the show The Munsters.. It is a specific word used in a specific way on the show and I wouldn't use it unless I asked permission.. But what you can do is change it a little bit and it will be your word then. All you have to do to make a product different enough to market it as your product is a change of 10 percent.. So instead of it being Dragula spell it Draguala or something like that.. But I sure wouldn't put it in print without asking permission of the The Munsters owners or you might face a lawsuit. Better a little different and yours as a copy and theirs anyway don't you think?

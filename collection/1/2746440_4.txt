Only time will tell. As we are living in the time of Bush's presidency now, we are all quick to make very subjective judgements about how he's running the country and about the war in Iraq. It will only be after about 10 or 15 years have passed that we will be able to look back and see if the Bush admistration actually had a positive, negative, or rather neutral effect on the country.. . Admittedly,though, it doesn't look good for Bush right now!

Interesting question, however, you do not need to shout.. . I asked myself the same question. I could not go by the joy and emotion I felt when I was first saved. I needed something concrete. I found it in Biblical prophecy. The Bible is the ONLY book that contains propecy that you can track and confirm. So if prophecy is accurate, you can trust the reat to be true as well. It is ia simple logic.

Quantum physics is about the characteristics of subatomic particles and it says that energie is not continuously, but in form of quanta (packages)Quantum mechanics is a fundamental branch of theoretical physics that replaces classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism at the atomic and subatomic levels.an atoms the smallest possible particle of a chemical element that retains its chemical properties.Most atoms are composed of three types of subatomic particles    * electrons, which have a negative charge and are the least massive of the three;.     * protons, which have a positive charge and are about 1836 times more massive than electrons; and.     * neutrons, which have no charge and are about 1839 times more massive than electrons.. . Protons and neutrons make up a dense, massive atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The electrons form the much larger electron cloud surrounding the nucleus.. . . then search in other websites........

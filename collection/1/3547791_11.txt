My dog had the same problem.Some of the ticks were so big that I couldn't see down inside her ear.One was the size of a nickle. I took her to the vet,The vet gave me some medicine to pour down inside her ears.I can't remember what it was he gave me,,but it looked like milk. After a few days all the ticks were gone.

Because bad stuff is more interesting than good stuff, and usually takes longer to explain. Think about it. If a close friend asks you how your day went and it was a good day, you'll probably just say it was good. If something bad happened, you might spend quite a while muttering about what your spouse did or how the car broke down on the way to an important meeting or whatever.

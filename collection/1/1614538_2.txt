The quantity corresponding to the spring constant, roughly, is the modulus of elasticity, or Young's modulus. . . Young's modulus E is the ratio of stress to strain:. . E=stress/strain. . stress has the units of pressure, N/m^2. . strain has is unitless, since it is the fraction of deformation, or deformation over undeformed length.  . E has units of N/m^2; 1 N/m^2 =1 Pascal, or 1 Pa. . Typical values of E. . These are a function of the stress level, and the loading history, however a range is given below. . .   Typical E. . Unweathered overconsolidated clays 20 ~ 50 MPa. Boulder clay 10 ~ 20 MPa. Keuper Marl (unweathered) >150 MPa. Keuper Marl (moderately weathered) 30 ~ 150 MPa. Weathered overconsolidated clays 3 ~ 10 MPa. Organic alluvial clays and peats 0.1 ~ 0.6 MPa. Normally consolidated clays 0.2 ~ 4 MPa. Steel 205 MPa. Concrete 30 MPa

If you replace certain parts of the fuel system and get it to the point that it can take the much greater heat levels, then you can run it on moonshine. It's probably not worth the trouble and risk, though. Actual ethanol would work much better, and parts are available that are certain to handle the increased heat from burning ethanol instead of gasoline.

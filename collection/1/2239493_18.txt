Because the word "Infinite" is the only way humans know how to decribe the nature of its magnitude.  In essence, the universe is never-ending because the relaity it exists in doesn't represent our 3-dimensional world. Rather, it exists "forever" and is "unending" because time is factored in.  Look into the stars, and many of  the things you see don't exist anymore...but their light rays are just now hitting us.  Therefore, the universe is "infinite" becuase it will never be "finite" or final.  It simply just mixes time and space forever as far as we're concerned.

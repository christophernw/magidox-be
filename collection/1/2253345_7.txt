Well, in Catholicism, divorce is the inability on both parts to work out the marriage and is widely not accepted purely because both refuse to make the marriage work.  The annulment however, is a single person within the marriage had not intention from the beginning of the marriage to ever make the marriage work.  In Protestant churches, divorce is acceptable if it is because of unfaithfulness.  Annulment would then be the shared determination that the marriage will not work because of one's own personal beliefs and not the others.

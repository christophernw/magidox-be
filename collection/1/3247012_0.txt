the little girl is probably not a ghost, but a poltergist. Poltergists feed off of your enegry and that is how they are able to stay. They don't do any harm other then occasionally hiding thing things. But if you want to get rid of her, the best way is just to talk to her. It may sound silly, but they were probably a human at one point. Most people realease energy right before they go to bed, so the best way to keep her from being inide you room, is just to release all of your energy before you get to your room. To relaese your energy, just imaging you're balling up your energy, and then let it go.

An Air conditioning system normally just cools the air in the room (or vehicle) in which it is fitted.. . It works like a refrigerator but expels the warm air to atmosphere rather than the room.. . The disadvantage of the normal system is that it dries the air.. . Some systems can apply heat too so that a controlled temperature can be selected from a much wider range, and more sophisticated systems can maintain a desired humidity.

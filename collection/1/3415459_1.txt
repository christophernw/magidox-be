It shows you how corrupt they are, that they have to lie and cheat to get elected. Rove is the best weapon the republicans have. He gets paid to spread lies. Vote issues not party. If you are pleased with the war, border security, health care, and moral character of the administration, vote republican. If not vote for a change. Each change will come in your own district. Keep voting the same, keep getting the same results.

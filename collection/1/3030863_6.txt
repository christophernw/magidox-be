Excuse me deary, but if it weren't for the UK, there would be no US, well there would and probably a better one, because the native Americans could've lived in peace. The Americans did NOT really help in the war, they just thought, oh we may as well show our faces now that it's nearly over and the other countries have done all the hard work, but we'll take credit for it. I'm not jealous of stupid, ignorant people, who fight for oil when there's some in a place right by them (Alaska, I believe has oil.). America did NOT save Europe, Europe did, thankyou very much, I think perhaps it's America that are jealous!!

The boil on your vagina may be a Bartholin's cyst, which is an infection of the Bartholin's gland. This will require antibiotics, and possibly incision and drainage. The boil under your arm is probably a staph infection, and possibly a resistant staph. This will also need antibiotics, and may also need incision and drainage. See your doctor!

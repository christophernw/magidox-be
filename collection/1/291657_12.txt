Islam isn't trying to conquer the world.  God tells the Muslim to spread the message of Islam, which says that there is only one God, that he has no sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, etc., and that is is He who controls everything within the Heavens and the Earth.  Islam teaches that our sole purpose in life is to worship Him.  So, you see Islam spreading at its rapid pace, yet Islam doesn't carryout missionary activities like the Christians.  Islam is spreading so rapidly (especially in the USA) because of what it teaches -- compassion, equality, justice, etc.. . Islam doesn't need to "conquer" anything.  The message speaks for itself.

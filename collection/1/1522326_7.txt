Airplane wings have a flat bottom and curved top. As air travels over the wing it takes the air a longer time to travel over the top than the bottom. This creates a lower air pressure on the top of the wing which gives the wing a lifting force.. . Any object that weighs less than the amount of water it displaces floats. A boat is mostly empty space and its wide suface displaces alot of water.

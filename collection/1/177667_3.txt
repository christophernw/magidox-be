Before I help you with this, first ask yourself: "Do I just want foot traffic? or do I want qualified buyers who are ready to buy a car?". . Popcorn, hot dogs and balloons are nice...but they don't sell cars. It's fine if you just want to have a party on your lot, but those types of events attracts slackers, moochers and the type of people who would rather die than pay for anything.. . I can help you with this, but you need to decide what you want to accomplish first. Do you just want traffic or do you want people ready to buy.. . Let me know...

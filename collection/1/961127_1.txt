Wow, I thought this was tongue in cheek until I saw this guy's other questions.  But I have to say that I agree.  If fundamentalists disagree with evolution because of the bible, then they should also find all science disagreeable.  If carbon dating is wrong then we don't understand enough about radiation to control nuclear energy.  Nuclear reactors are just time bombs waiting for some random burst of energy that science doesn't understand to blow them sky high.. . Modern medicine just interferes with god's plan.  Humans were fine with a lifespan in the mid-40's for the past 1,800 years.  Why do we need to live to our mid-70's?  Shame on us.

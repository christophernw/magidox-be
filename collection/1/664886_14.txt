There are very few opportunities to go after other religious beliefs, and you probably wouldn't notice if we did.  It's not as if there are massive numbers of non-Christian religious people a) in North America or b) frequenting popular English-language Internet forums.. . Other explanations:. . 1.  Jews--at least American Jews--are only about one notch above Atheists, religiously.  There's no point in arguing with someone who a) doesn't believe in Hell and b) doesn't believe in converting people to his religion.. . 2.  Muslims will kill you.. . 3.  Most other religions are entirely non-objectionable to Atheists because they are commonly understood as metaphor or philosophy and have no negative consequences on their society.  The one exception I can think of is the Hindu caste system.. . 4.  Beyond just the sheer mathematical likelihood of finding yourself in an argument with a Christian versus an argument with a radical Far East mystic, there is the immediacy of the threat to consider.  We live in a country where over 75% of the people are Christian.  Other religious groups comprise only 3.7%.  3.7%!  (This is from the 2001 American Religious Identification Survey.)  Other studies have shown that about 45% of Americans think Christ is probably going to return within 50 years.  A similar percentage believe creationism should be taught in schools.. . I don't know if you can understand the magnitude of this situation, but just try to think about what it means to be a Christian.  That's someone who believes in God, believes in Jesus, and believes that the Bible is the word of God.  75% of Americans believe that, and there is no scientific reason for any of it.  To an Atheist, that's frightening.. . Just think about how many nuclear bombs are in the United States' possession, and maybe you can understand how--even more--frightening it is for the Atheists in Europe.. . That's why you only see Atheists going after Christianity.

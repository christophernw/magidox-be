Lemon pies will ''weep'' water because of the interaction between the filling and the whipped lemon. If one or the other is overcooked, water beads will form and weep. Egg whites can also weep if they are over-beaten or are from old eggs. Refrigeration (unfortunately) speeds up the process of weeping -- oops! It's so tough to tell where the problem lies that I like to use a pre-cooked lemon

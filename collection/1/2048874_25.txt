of course exercise is the best way, but crunches alone are not enough. while crunches will tone up your ab muscles in time, they will not get rid of the fat (there is no such thing as 'targeting' a certain area to burn fat), so your stomach may actually appear bigger temporarily. if you want to get rid of the fat, do aerobics regularly as well.. . at the same time, you can try slowly eating a little less over a few days. the stomach can be conditioned in this way to feel full with less, since it is elastic. but don't overdo this; its unhealthy to starve yourself.. . a quicker fix: try slimming patches! L'Oreal's PerfectSlim patch is not bad, i hear. but these patches are of course only temporary, and can be expensive to use regularly.. . we all hate to hear this, but exercise is really be healthiest and most long-lasting way. it will not only tone your abs but your entire body as well. plus it builds discipline, and your body will thank you for it ;D

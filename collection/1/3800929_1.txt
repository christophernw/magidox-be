Every object attract and repulse one another. In small bodies such forces have almost no effect because forces are very feeble.Whereas in huge celestial bodies attraction and repulsions are considerable.So earth has been attracting the moon as well as repulsing.Also centrifugal and the centripetal  forces have existed  due to revolution around the earth is  helpful in keeping moon`s orbit.Actually moon is moving towards the earth very slowly.When it comes relatively closer to earth after millions of years moon has to revolve faster to maintain its orbit.Also as it comes nearer to earth it cannot withstand interaction of repulsion attraction of earth hence blasts out into pieces. These pieces will  once again revolve round the earth in different orbits. Small pieces may fall on earth as asteroids.You may wonder  how intelligently the nature is protecting the earth.

It's terrible that you people are so uninformed. That's probably why the Iraq invasion happened in the first place. Nothing you've heard on the issue from your cosy homes on your colourful TV is further from the truth. It's a long and in-depth subject. I recommend you watch some of the excellent documentaries which will give you a better picture of what's happening. You can download the following from the net: . . "denial stops here" - mike ruppert. "the truth and lies of 9/11" - mike ruppert. "beyond treason". "outfoxed". "control room". "mind control" - cathy o'brien

I think you're asking where it really comes from. Like plants and stuff.. . The story goes something like this.... . 1. These hydro-carbons have been captured from the atmosphere, and put into plants, -by photosynthesis, ie the sun.. . 2. These plants die, and make up the top layers of the soil, or sink to the bottom of a lake.. . 3. After so many years, thousands of feet of this stuff exists, and it retains the hydro-carbons. It gets covered up and compressed, it turns into oil. Nobody can really duplicated how long this really takes.. . 4. We find the oil, parse it into different 'burnables" butane, gasoline, diesel, road tar, etc.. . 5. We give back to nature what was originally taken from the atmosphere, ie the hydro-carbons. Some call it "pollution". . . ***. -or-. maybe God put the oil in the ground, for us to find it, and fulfill a destiny for human kind.

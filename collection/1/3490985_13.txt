Let's go through a long and comlicated explanation on this one, shall we?. . Solution One:. Say you can't count on your fingers, and you need to be able to add 2 and 2. Start by figuring out one's. How many one's does it take to get to two? Lets count; 1...2. So  there are two one's in a two.. Now that you now there are 2 one's in a 2, you need to add (1+1)+(1+1). The first set of parenthesis represent the first two, and the second set of parenthesis represent the second two. You would then remove the parenthesis (since it's addition it doesn't matter) so you would then have 1+1+1+1. One plus one equals 2, plus one is three, plus one is four. Tada!!. . Solution Two:. Since you know that 1+1=11, 2+2 must equal 22.. . Solution Three:. If 1+1=Window, 2+2 must be a door....or is it the windowpane??. . . Way to waist five points. Thanks for the easy two though!!

I'll give you a simple one:. 1 package McCormick Taco Seasoning. 1 # ground beef. 1 red onion. 1 large tomato. 1 bunch cilantro. 1 can black olives (sliced). 1 bag shredded cheddar. 1 bag fritos or tostitos chips. 1 jar of salsa . 1 bag of lettuce (already cleaned and cut). 1 16 oz tub of sour cream. (Add whatever you'd like for spiciness like Jalapenos or Crushed Red  Pepper).. Cook the meat, follow the directions on the seasoning packet. Dice the onion. Chop the cilantro Just cut the longer stems off and discard.. Dice the tomato.  . Put everything in separate containers, . toss the salad (leave out the salsa and sour cream)  when you get to the reunion and top with a little more cheese for presentation!. Put the salsa and sour cream on the side so people can choose if they want it or not (dieters will appreciate this) !. . You can add refried beans also, but that gets a little messy and the aren't very good cold (in my opinion).

Unfortunatly some people fight in the name of Islam and call themselves Muslims (most of these people are the Wahabi's).  The do not actually believe what Muslims belief, they attribute non-befitting attributes to GOD and they interpret the Qur'an the way that they want,or they way that their teaches wanted to.  Either way the TRUE Muslims would not just  go off and kill people.  There are MILLIONS of Muslims in the USA, Lebanon, Syria, France, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, etc.... and they dont go off and kill people.  It is just that this specfic group of people get all the media and so unfrotunatly most of the people think that this is how Muslims are because they believe what is said on the news.

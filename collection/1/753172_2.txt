I did not know that is the case.  It seems to me that people hate/discriminate against Hispanics the most.  They claim that illegal immigrant Hispanics take jobs and financial resources such as medicare and social security away from the Americans.. . I do not feel that way toward Hispanics at all.  That is just the attitude I see around me.

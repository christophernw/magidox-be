I personally practice Judaism because it was this practice that was given to my ancestors by G-d when he reviled himself at Mt. Sinai. I practice this because I logically cant understand how some one can make up a religion that claims that 3 million people saw G-d at once and not only that they were your ancestors. I think if some one was making it up they would be laughed out of the room and yet here it is. As for being a Deist I think that is great if it was not for the above I would be too every thing I believe is grounded in the principals of logic and science I take nothing on the basis of faith. As for G-d being dead I find that Illogical for the following reason. Everything that we relate to has a beginning and an end that being said one can ask where did it all come from something can not just appear out of nothingness. In my opinion this is G-d he is unchangeable and eternal and if he were to have an end that would mean he has a beginning as well and your left with the question of where the universe came from.

I called my husband and wish him a happy birthday.  He turned 30 today.  He's currently in training to be deployed to Afghanistan.  I called my grandparents.  The rest of the day I spent drawing various dinosaurs for a powerpoint presentation I'm giving in Historical Geology on Wednesday, while I recorded things off my Tivo to ship to my hubby tomorrow.

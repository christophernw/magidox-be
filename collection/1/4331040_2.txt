probably. . obesity is due to overeating (forget 'hormones' and the like - no one was fat in belsen). . that is when the calories consumed are in excess of the calories burned up on a day in day out basis due to the overabundance of easy high calorie food.. . add to that the fact that in America the whole place actually is dangerous to even walk places just to go do some shopping or take the kids to school - hence an over reliance on cars to go even a short distance then you certainly have a recipe for disaster

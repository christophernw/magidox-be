Hi all.I 'm a bird breeder.THe right way to find the sex of birds is:. Touch the bird's pelvic bone.It is just above the anus.U will be able to feel a pair of bones .........If the pair of bones are very near to eachother and are pointing,then the bird is a male.If the pair of bones are a bit wider ,then its a female.. This test can be done 4 only mature birds.. NOTE : Do it carefully and gently,b'coz it is sensitive and may break.Then the bird may also die.. Be careful b'coz u r handling a emu.

FYI, it's not "Old English"--that's from before 1066 or so--it's "Early Modern English". So one thing that's hard is that you don't get to read it in translation.. . Language changes over time, and 400 years is a long time. When's the last time you used the word "wherefore"? . . Also, he wrote plays, so they were meant to be spoken, not read silently, so I think the pacing's not what you'd expect--plus the original audience would have the benefit of the actors' actions, vocal expression, etc. to understand the story. And they didn't have to write an essay on it! And the language is generally flowery, so quite likely even Shakespeare's audiences missed a bit.

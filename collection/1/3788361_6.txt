Its that time of year where dogs start dropping their winter coats....  Take him to a groomers and get him groomed.  Tell them the dog is shedding and that you don't mind paying extra for a little more brushing than normal - see if they offer a shed-less treatment.. . Try NOT to shave your dog unless it absolutely needs it (such as for a health condition) - a dog has its fur for a reason, it regulates body temperature and prevents it from getting sunburned.. . After you get him home from the groomers, make a promise to yourself to brush the dog at least three times a week.  Buy a slicker brush and an undercoat rake from a pet store - they work really well.  (Don't brush too hard or for too long though, especially with the rake - the dog will get brush burn!)

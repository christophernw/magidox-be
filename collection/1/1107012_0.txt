Just like northwest is halfway between north and west, north-northwest is halfway between north and northwest.  Here's everything: north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, north-northeast, east-northeast, east-southeast, south-southeast, south-southwest, west-southwest, west-northwest, and north-northwest.  A wind blowing from west to east I believe is called a westerly wind.  Winds are named by the direction they come from, not which way they're going.

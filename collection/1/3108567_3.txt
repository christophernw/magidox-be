First part of your problem is right.Addition of two negative intgers is always negative.But their difference between two negative integrs is neither lwys positive nor always negative.It would depend on if you are subtravting the smaller number from the bggr negative number or not.For example if you subtract -35 from -24 you would get a positive answer.-24-(-35)=-24+35=+11 . But if you subtract -24 from -35 you get a negative answer.-35-(-24)=-35+24=-11

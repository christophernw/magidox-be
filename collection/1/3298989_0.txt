I would say the veins are close to the surface and you may be blowing too hard and causing an eruption.  You also may be picking inside your nose which leaves scab which may bleed with a little push. If it bleeds too much you can be in trouble. Be careful and if it seems like too much blood and you're unable to stop it, go to the hospital emergency for wrapping.

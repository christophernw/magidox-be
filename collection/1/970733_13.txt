You are grossly mistaken.  The government is indeed concerned over the drug problem in schools, and they promote legislation of laws that protect students and prevent drug sales within the vicinity of the schools and to minors.  The problems that cause youths to use drugs are not the schools... maybe parents should re-examine their own lifestyles and what they say and do in front of their own children?  Maybe they should also demand truth and less corruption on the part of their religious leaders and elected officials by demanding accountability?  Those are the ones that SHOULD know better yet are giving the worst examples to our youths.. . The issue over the Bible in schools is that the religion should be practiced at home and in one's place of worship, not to interfere with the academic pursuits for which the schools are intended.  Why?  Because I may not subscribe to your religion or you might not subscribe to mine or, for that matter, the fact that I am an atheist means that I do not go to any place of worship because I do not believe in supernatural/superstitious matters and do not want to be bothered with these matters in school... I would be attending school to learn about academia, not religion or religious views or religious matters or supernatural phenomena.. . Would you like YOUR child being influenced by another religion's propaganda?  I don't want my children influenced by someone else's personal beliefs, either!. . Places of worship do not teach our children history, biology, math and other academic subjects so it is only fair that the students take advantage of the limited time they have in school to learn about those academic subjects that will prepare them for employment or higher education or vocational education.. . Roe vs. Wade was about privacy issues between a woman and her doctor or caregivers, not anything else.  What a woman and her doctor or the procedure(s) that take place are not the government's business, that includes abortions as a medical procedure (because the primary patient is the woman, not the fetus).  Why do people twist things around?  If more people would adopt children, especially those that are against abortions, we wouldn't be discussing this issue (that's a solution no one wants to contemplate).. . There has been enough bloodshed and killings and tortures as a result of religious views/differences and religious strife throughout history around the world to also bring that into our schools.  If you want your children to learn religion, teach them yourself or have them attend your place of worship, but leave those topics out of our schools!. . Your question was loaded in favor of an anticipated reply; sorry to disappoint you.  Best wishes.

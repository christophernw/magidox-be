Galatians 5:17. For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want.. . . -It is our nature of sin- We are forgiven through Christ Jesus and made perfect through Him but our flesh is in constant battle with our spirit. However those who are saved are convicted by the Holy Spirit when they do sin- allowing them to repent and be "aware" of it. We do not want to sin- but sometimes our flesh is weak.. . Mark 14:38. Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."

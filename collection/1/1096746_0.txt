I would echo the first answer. With any dog, you'll want to give it adequate attention, care, and a good dog food. Make sure it gets exercise each day, but give your dog plenty of mental stimulation, too, with training and with puzzle toys. Establish a relationship of trust and respect with your dog, socialize it with other dogs and people, and you have a happy pet.

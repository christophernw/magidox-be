I am a Muslim. I am even against protesting against those cartoons. Muslims were indirectly advertising the cartoons world over. Also, there is no meaning in boycotting danish products. The most a muslim should have done is to stop reading that newspaper.. . There were lot of religious leaders that have condemned killing of innocent civillians. Attacks on civillians done by anyone is terrorism.

Same reason why the grass is green and the sky is blue. . If you think about it red symoblizes danger (as a rule) if you something something red it is telling you not to do it. Or red ALSO catches your eye quicker than any other color (proven through a 12th grade science project) . . Green is a positive color and yellow is a negative color (per color therapy). . It's possible, I don't know :D Just my theory and yammering on ;)

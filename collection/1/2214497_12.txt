Dogs should never be chained for long periods of time!  They are social animals who want to be with their families.  Chaining a dog outside is cruel and illegal in some states.  If you have to keep him outside at least go out with him and play with him. Or take him for a nice walk first so he doesn't feel isolated and alone outside.   Alot of dogs have choked to death on chains when people leave them outside all day.  Chaining is really bad for them I feel so sorry for an animal I see chained up what a lousy life for them!!

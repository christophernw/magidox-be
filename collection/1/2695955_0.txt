Everybody always says that the best way is to use a crappie 'jig'. It looks basically like a small insect, with a hook. You bounce it around as you slowly reeel in your line, jerking it lightly. . . Personally, I say you get yourself a crappie rig, which holds two hooks away from each other about 6" or so. Use a couple of small nightcrawlers. . . Like they say, if they're not biting on worms, they're not biting on anything.

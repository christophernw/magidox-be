you can safely use if your careful a wire brush attatchment on a drill, if you go to yout local auto store draper sell a pack of 3 which are specially designed to clean in to all the nooks and crannies of the engine, i presume your going to clean the valves as well , pop a drill in a vice and then pop the valves in there, use a scrapper or a pen knife (wearing goggles of course) and simply scrap the despoites off then startting with 120 production paper work your away up to 1000 wet and dry and this will clean the valves a treat and help give better swirl as well.  If you need to remove the old head gasket from the mating surface of the head a good tip is to get a piece of glass and wrap production paper round there and use it as a flat surface to clean the head.

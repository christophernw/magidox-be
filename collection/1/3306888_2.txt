Humans are not alone. we are naturaly drawn to eachother even the loners (i'm considered one myself) need human contact at one time or another but God Created us for fellowship (together time) 1 John 1:7. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin. God is by your side whether you want him there or not

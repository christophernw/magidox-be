Take you car to Auto Zone and they can run a system diagnostics test to find out what it could possibly be. The test is FREE!  It could be something as simple as your air filter being dirty. If Auto Zone tells you its your O2 sensor, check the air filter first before replacing the sensor. That was the problem with mine. Good luck

Maybe it's because they'd rather worship no God than be associated with a faith that calls others "self-centered" "coward" "infidel" and "stupid."  Way to set an example, guys.  If you want people to take you an your faith seriously, give the name calling a rest.   I may be a masochist, but I'm not a big enough masochist to join any faith where some followers think it's well within their rights to call people who believe or believe differently stupid and self-centered.  . . Yes, you figured it all out and the only thing stopping you from proving God is real is your mom.  Your name isn't Norman is it?

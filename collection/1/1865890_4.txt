One person voting, in the grand scheme, doesn't mean anything to anyone but you.  What you are doing in participating in the process.  You are exercising a right that you have to have a say in how your government is run.  You are saying "I'm doing my part!  I'm participating in my government because I have a stake in the outcome."  Finally, those who don't vote forfeit their right to complain about the government.

In everyday use, a "theory" is an unsupported speculation. Like many words, however, this term has a different meaning in science. . "A theory is a scheme or system of ideas and statements held as an explaination or account of a group of facts or phenomena; a hypothesis that has been confirmed or established by observation or experiement, and is propounded or accepted as accounting for the know facts;a statement of what are known to be general laws,principles, or causes of something know or observed". . Evolution is a fact. But the fact of evolution is explained by evolutionary theory.. . To claypigeon-- I do believe God created life but he did it through emergent complexity and evolution.

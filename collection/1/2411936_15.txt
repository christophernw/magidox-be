Many christians do this because they are using religion as a crutch for masking their own insecurities and undoings in the first place. There are many so called Christians that are only "witnesses" because in order to deal with their own issues or problems they just call it "God's will" which obsolves them of having to take any responsibility. But in the end, like many with insecurities about themselves, jealousy at those that are different eventually finds it's way through. It is this jealousy that gets masked as hatred towards other things that don't coincide with what they preach. It is no different then the little boy on the school playground that makes fun of or picks on the little girl because he has a crush on her but doesn't know how to handle his feelings and is embarassed by them. These so called Christians bag on other's because it is easier to find fault with them then try and deal with their own insecurities and questions that come about with a differnt point of view.

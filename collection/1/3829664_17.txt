confirmity.. . I'm an athiest but its jsut as easy to go along with the parties and stuff. . . I notice you mention parties and pressies, these have nothing to do with the religous festival anyway.. . If you said you join in with going to church or something that would be a valid question. But you're not talking about religious activities anyway.. . tree8588 is plainly wrong, you are not a hypocrite. You would be a hypocrite if you went to church and pretended to celebrate christmas as a christian. You're just joining in having a good time, don't bother to analyse it - let the fanatics do that for you.

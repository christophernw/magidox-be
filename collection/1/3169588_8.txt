I have an alternative solution. If you weight lift, doing chest flys on an inclined bench (hold the weights with straight arms next by your chest, and for three seconds keep your arms straight and lift the weights until they are touching over your chest, then for three seconds bring them back down) 10-12 times every other day, that should help. don't use weights that are too heavy for you (you can't do 10 reps if they are too heavy, start with 3 lbs. each), and don't do it more than 4 times a week. Good luck.

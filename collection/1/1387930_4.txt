"Driving Under the Influence" is what the letters DUI stand for.  It is legal grounds for arrest and conviction for driving a motor vehicle while having a specific level of alcohol, drugs or chemicals in one's bloodstream that could alter one's judgement and reaction time in a sudden emergency situation.

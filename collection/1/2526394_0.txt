Whittling is the art of carving shapes out of raw wood with a knife, as in the whittling of a toy boat. It is a tradition that has been practiced worldwide for centuries.. . Sometimes the terms "whittling" and "carving" are used interchangeably, but this is incorrect. Carving implies the use of chisels, gouges, and a mallet, while whittling implies only the use of a knife.. Whittling is typically performed with a light, small-bladed knife, usually a pocket knife. Specialized whittling knives exist and are most desirable because their chunky handles are easier to grip for long periods and are held close to the blade, allowing precise control and pressure.

My new softball team (I've played in 5 games for our tournament and one scrimmage and now 2 practices) was crabby today, more like 1 girl sassily spread the bad mood.  She was creating disunity on the team and I didn't participate in it.  I cheered for my friend who's not played with these girls as long so she was probably nervous.  I held the door for a couple people at the post office.  I was polite to everyone on my softball team that was nice to me and thanked them for their tips instead of sassing back.  Other than that not much and tomorrow I should be nicer to my brother.. *LATER the NEXT DAY*. Well thus far I've really only played 2-square with my sister and I was making her laugh a lot, so that's good.  I need to make more of a difference than that though.

How can you want to be a doctor and not be interested in anatomy? Maybe you need to reevaluate why you always wanted to be a doctor. Was it just the money and prestige? Maybe you need to redirect your goal to an area of medicine that does interest you and will motivate you. Forensics? Coroner? Research? Sounds like simply practicing medicine is what you're questioning. The preparation today will seem worth it if the end result is something you're passionate about doing in the future. Seems you need to refocus on what it is you really want to do. If you aren't willing to make the sacrifices, then maybe you really don't want it as bad as you thought.

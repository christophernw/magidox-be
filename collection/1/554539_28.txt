I read to relax and escape from everyday life.. I try to learn something new when I pick up a book.. I read instead of watching the late night news or talk shows like Jay Leno, David Letterman and Conan O'Brien.. I also read because I am able to! . I think that sometimes reading also helps time go by on vacations or plane rides.

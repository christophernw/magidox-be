Rabecky's question show a complete misunderstanding of the 2nd law.  As a previous poster said, the 2nd law ONLY applies to closed systems.  The earth is a very open system.  We receive huge amounts of energy from the sun.  The local entropy decrease we experience on earth is paid for by the huge entropy increase of the sun.. . In addition, entropy is not disorder.  Disorder is only a rough approximation used when speaking with non-technical people.  It's a mathematical and chemical concept that is actually hard to understand.. . Creationists have been misapplying this for years.  It never stops.

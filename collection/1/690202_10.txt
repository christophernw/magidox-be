Because it's hard. You should know better than anyone. But I don't get the whole natural plants thing? How can some random plant come up with the precise chemical compound to fight something in human beings? I mean, you got Asprin, and what else? Figuring out a way for the human body to constantly fight cancer would be better. With nanobots or something like that?

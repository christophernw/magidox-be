Magick, like energy can not be produced, but is already in everything. . . Magick  is a fire creating heat, trees coming back to life after a long cold winter, food turning into energy, a new life in a womb, the warm fuzzy feelings we get when we see someone who is loved. . . The practice of magick is to gather the energy already present in the world around us, and direct it towards a desired goal. Magick is not instantaneous either, it takes time, patience and practice. Magick is a tool to help, You can do all the spells you want for employment, but if you dont get off the couch and look for a job, the you wont find one. It is much like prayer, you may not see the results, but you can feel it working, and if nothing else helps have a positive frame of mind, which always helps.

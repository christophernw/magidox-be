You're sensitive, there's nothing wrong with that. Just get pissed and work it out, and realize that the kid's opinion doesn't matter. Actually, my guess is that it kinda stems from a bit of jealously over this kid's relationship with your brother. Maybe you are actually wishing you played a bigger role in his life? *shrug* Something to think about instead of dwelling.

All that believe in Christ and truly repent for their sins, do not purposely set out to sin again and again. That is simple manipulation of a situation.  If your heart is true to your faith, it is that faith that keeps you on the right path.  It can be measured comparatively to love, loving someone means you never want to do anything to hurt them, only wanting to do things that uplift them. So in a true relationship with God, straying off of His path for you is the last thing you want to do, and with each step in your faith walk,  you walk towards God, not in another direction.

My power would be the ability to stop time, to stop everything & everybody. Superhero wise, this would be a great power because it gives you the time to get to the bad guy & save the world. But personally, there is just not enough time in the day for me. And if I'm running late for something, I could just stop time & get to where I'm going, then restart time again.

Well, watch out for the dry socket thing....its not a fun time!!!!  I got it about a week later.....dont suck out of a straw when you drink something, and try not to get food on the side of your mouth...it will irritate it!  Dont use the gel-like toothpaste either...it has too much of the chemical in it, use regular ol'white Colgate.....

religion literally means to " re connect" or "re-tie," which refers to the help we might get re-connecting with our Creator on earth and in heaven (from priests-monks-ministers-rabbis and the community of that church). . Christianity is the collection of various branches of christ-based religions studying and hopefully learning and living Christ's teachings, with His promise (as God the son) that it will help us return to God the Father.

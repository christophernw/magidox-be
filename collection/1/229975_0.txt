Cranberry juice is better for you as far as using it to keep UTIs from occuring. Cocktail is mixed with other juice, so not as much help. Drinking the recommended daily ammount of water is better than anything else for helping to prevent them in the first place, because juice has so much natural sugars in them that they are not really that good for you...even the ones that claim to be "No sugar added"

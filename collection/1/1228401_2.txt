In my experience, it is definitely true that I don't want to shop until I see something I love.  It's like junk food:  if you don't buy it, you won't eat it.  If you really want to stop spending money on clothes, don't look at those sites or go into clothing stores!  Take the sites off of your favorite list and commit to boycotting them (or setting aside a short amount of time periodically and only using them at that time.). The other thing I like to keep in mind is that I don't have to be compelled to buy anything, even if it is a great deal or would be useful or is super cute.  Always lean towards feeling you shouldn't buy something if you have even the slightest reservation about it.. My third piece of advice is to always wait a few days after you see an item until you buy it.  You can rid the purchase of being an "impulse purchase" and find out if you really truly love it.. Hope this helps!

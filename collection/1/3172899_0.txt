The cleaning may be causing the problem! Once a piercing is healed your normal daily bath or shower is enough.Extra cleaning may irritate the skin. You say sea salt and saline solution-saline IS a salt solution,so you are using an irritating hypertonic solution as well. With no discharge, redness or tenderness I can positively say it's not infected.

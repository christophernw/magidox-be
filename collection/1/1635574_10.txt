Substitute the "ah" for quiet time, this will give you enough time to think about what to say next, instead of trying to fill out the blank time with "ah". You will sound more professional, and the audience will get the feeling you are more educated and knowlegeable of your subject; whereas if you keep "ah"ing your way through the speech, the audience will believe you have no knowledge and are trying to fill in the void. Take a breath while you stop to think, so it flows smoothly with the audience.

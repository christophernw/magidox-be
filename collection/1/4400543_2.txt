The amount of babies a species has is directly related to the need for survival of the species. Fish lay thousands of eggs because the vast majority will be eaten as eggs, young or adult. Some will survive and the species will continue. Others, like humans have typically one baby because the baby needs a lot of care to survive. It is only in recent history that humans have had so much abundance that most children survive.

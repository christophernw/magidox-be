You would wan to consult with a lawyer who has experience in estate planning as well as IP. The paintings would probably fall under the category of IP, so therefore, if they were not copyrighted they could be fair game, especially after the death of your cousin. Good luck though, but I think you might find this is going to be a difficult battle.

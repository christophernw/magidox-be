Do you think that the left wing of the American Boot-on-your-neck party (the Democrats) would do better in Iraq than the right wing of the party (the Republicans)?. . It's really difficult to fight a war against only some of the people in a region: it really ties your hands.  If the US were willing to just go in and kill every man, woman, and child in Iraq, the war would be over pretty quickly.  But Americans, rightfully, wouldn't stand for that.

pH stands for the "power of Hydrogen".. . On a scale from 0-14, it is a base 10 scale (as you move from one number to the next, it is 10 times stronger or weaker).. . Substances that range below 7 are considered acids (containing an H+ ion).. . Substances that range above 7 are considered alkaline or bases (containing an OH- ion).. . Substances close to 7 are considered neutral.. . The further away from 7 you get, the stronger an acid or base gets.

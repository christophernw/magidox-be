Well.. not sure what you are after.. I think that the laser driver circuit is designed for extremely close controls causing little or no fluctuation to the laser diode.. . I am not a specialist on this subject bukt I believe a laser driver circuit is to generate a bias current based, at least in part, upon a reference average power signal and a measured average power signal, and to generate a modulation current based, at least in part, upon a reference swing power and a measured swing power signal.

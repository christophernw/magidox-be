That's a good question, but i think the answer is obvious - without the grammar, how can you form your own sentence? You would have to learn off by heart every sentence that you wanted to say, in every tense! quite difficult I think if you find yourself wanting to say a sentence that you haven't yet learnt :) With the grammar, you can make the sentence in whatever tense you like. Plus, without the grammar, you might be misunderstood.

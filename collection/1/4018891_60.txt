As the word "Dragula" is in a script of "The Munsters," it means, the  U.S. copyright law protects EVERYTHING in a script.  . . I am sure you would say the same thing about everything in your script.    . . Protect yourself, call the U.S. copyright office, they will clarify for you.  . . As I am sure you know, there have been several recent lawsuits regarding copyright infringement.  Writers do not take this lightly and are suing writers.  You don't want a lawsuit when the writers find out about you appropriating their "word."

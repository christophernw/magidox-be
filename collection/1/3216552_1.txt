I agree with you on the bible.People do not seem to relize that God did not write the bible that man did.Their are so many things about it that just confuse the hell out of me. I think he wanted to see if we would choose him on our own based on all the different ideas of him floating around this world. We are just rats in a maze.Wouldnt it really be something if we were some science experiment for a more intelligent being

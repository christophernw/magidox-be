I'm assuming you are refering to the right handed people as my lefty friends do it the other way. It is easier to navigate the chopsticks with your dominant hand, in this case, the right one. Using the spoon is simpler as all you need to do is scoop, therefore using your non-dominant hand is sufficient for this task. I'm not sure of the cultural implications.

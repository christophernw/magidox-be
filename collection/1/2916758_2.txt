You know all these programs for acne are a scam to get you to buy all these products... the fact is that you and go to the drug store and get a bar of surgical soap.  It is the same soap that the doctor scrubs his hands before surgery.  It cheap and it works... Just softly put the suds on your face and work it in and splash it off.  It will kill the bacteria on your face.  I spent a lot of money on doctors and this little bar of soap work for me and I have not had any more trouble...

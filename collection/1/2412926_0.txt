It means that the amplifier is drawing more power than the circuit can safely deliver.  As a rough approximation, a 30A circuit can supply about 30A*14V=420W.  If you put a bigger fuse in there, the wiring will not handle the power draw and will likely start an electrical fire.  You need to put in a whole new circuit, from the battery to the amplifier, with wire sized to handle more than 1000W and a fuse appropriate for the wire size.

God is perfect and without sin.. The Bible says we were made in HIS IMAGE.. There is just one difference, though:. MAN was made to have the 'power of choice'.. MANKIND is the only creation that was made this way.. God did not give us a 'robot' mentality.. God gave us the ability to CHOOSE if we want to worship and obey Him or not.. And we made the wrong choice in Genesis 2.

As a matter of fact, Cyclone, the world is in the process of doing just that.  The good news is that everything is right on schedule and going according to plan.. I got the feeling you are pretty disgusted right now with the vanity of existence, and the important thing is that you get through that.  What you are witnessing around you has been here all along, and each 'successful' civilization has eventually destroyed itself.  . It seems you've reached a point in your life where you may be ready to consider asking God the creator to reveal Himself to you.   The destruction and pride you see all around you is due to man's refusal to communicate intimately with His creator.  If you truly seek this revelation (or introduction) to Him, He will put all the pieces of the puzzle together.  And you will come to understand He made you to enjoy life in Him.  You can have joy and wisdom and live completely fearless when you walk in that relationship.  And it ain't about church, OK?. Good luck.. P.S.  I just read Philip's answer & he made some good points.  Shoot, Cyclone, you may be the one we're all waiting on!!  :D

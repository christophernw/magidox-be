It is my christian desire to seek the unsaved and help them to find Jesus.  I am not going to burn in hell, but rather have life everlasting in Heaven.  I know that some think of Christianity as a "fairy tale", I know that God is and was and always will be, I know this because I feel the presence of the Creator, the Lord God Almighty in my heart.. . John 3:16. . For God so loved the world that he gave His only begotten Son so that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have life everlasting.. . God Bless

I think it's wrong people not being able to smoke in a pub.That's why people go out.All because someone doesn't smoke,everyone has to suffer.. In the old style pubs,there was always a public bar and a saloon type bar,for people,who didn't want to be around smokers.What's the point of having a /or going to a pub if you can't drink,it's pathetic.

The Primitive Baptist church is a different organization from the mainstream Baptist church that most people know. My ex's family are members of this church. It's very small, smaller even than the Church of Christ. They are pretty old-fashioned, the music and beliefs. Main preaching in faith and love. I think they only partake of the communion once a month. At the end of the service, they get up before dispersing and meet each other, shake hands and wish everyone else well, which is cool, but germ-spreading. That's all I can remember.

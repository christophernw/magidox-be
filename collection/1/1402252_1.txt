Age, genetics, high blood pressure, a lot of things can cause aneurysms. Some people are born with a predisposition for developing them. It's a weak spot in a blood vessel and it can rupture. Depending on where it's at and how fast you can get medical care, sometimes they are fatal. I'm sorry to hear about your friend, but in all honesty there really is no way to tell what caused the aneurysm. Smoking causes vasoconstriction which can worsen and aneurysm as well as causing your blood pressure to go up which can lead to an aneurysm. Certain drugs, like methamphetamine, can also contribute to the condition. Anything you do that increases your heart rate, raises your blood pressure or puts any kind of increased load on the blood vessels can increase the chances that an aneurysm will rupture. These things may or may not have caused the aneurysm though. There's simply no way to know for sure. Sorry and God bless.

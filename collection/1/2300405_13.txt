because it has starred in a movie (watch the grapes of wrath) it had its own tv show (route 66 ,hot guys in a hot corvette) it has a catchy theme song(tell me its not hard to resisit singing along or tapping your feet or snapping your fingers to it) most celebrities NEVER get all that.then you have nostalga,in the new movie cars the interstate is made to seem cold and impersonal where as ROUTE 66  is cool happy and retro chic.and some of the attractions along route 66 have achieved cult status too, like the cadillac ranch (25 caddys buried next to the road as a tribute to planned obsolesence) and the big texan steak ranch (home of the FREE 72 oz. steak dinner) it goes from downtown chicago to the santa monica pier-you think there might be something to that GO WEST YOUNG MAN ,huh?

Because He loved us SO much that he decided to die for us - in order to give us the chance to get to heaven. We wouldn't be able to go to heaven if he didn't die.....only the Jews would be able to.. . Love is passion....His passion in going through the crucifixion was so great that He was willing to be treated in most humiliating, cruel and unusually punishing way.....that any human can tolerate, it's unbelievable. He prayed to God 3 times not to go through with it, but finally accepted God's will for him....because to be crucified was his whole purpose in coming to the earth.

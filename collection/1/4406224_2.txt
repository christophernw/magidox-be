Start in Matthew, then read the next book, then the next, and when you get done with Revelations, Start in Matthew, then read the next book, then the next. Continue to do this until you die, or Christ comes back, which ever one comes first.. . God only reveals to those who have a True desire to understand. A person who reads the Bible once, and finds it confusing, and never picks it up again, does not have a True desire to learn God's Words. But one who rereads and rereads it many times, even though they are confused, DOES have a True desire to learn His Words, therefore only those who have a True desire to learn His Words, shall recieve the understanding of it.. . In His Holy and Precious Name, Jesus Christ. . DiscipleDave@aol.com. http://members.aol.com/discipledave/book/Index.html

O is the element symbol for oxygen, it's not O2. O2 is a molecule consisting of two oxygen atoms. "oxygen" is a diatomic molecule --- O2. Usually, the elements are abbreviated for what they stand. Oxygen begins with O, nitrogen begins with N, and so forth. But this does not always hold. For example, Hg is mercury. Makes no sense at all, but if you study chemistry you will come to remember these symbols.

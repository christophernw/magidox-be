I think the origin of homosexuality has relevance to the national debate on issues like gay marriage and the roles that homosexuals play in society.. . Many homosexuals claim that the failure of government to grant them rights that are afforded to heterosexuals is a form of "discrimination." To evaluate the extent to which government can "discriminate" against homosexuals - I believe that the issue boils down to a single question: Are homosexuals a protected class under the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution. I think Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Lawrence v. Texas follows this reasoning.. . The 14th Amend. limits the government's ability to discriminate on the basis of gender, race, legitimacy, etc. These are all 'innate' characteristics that are immutable, unchangeable, and form the essence of who a person is.. . For homosexuals to claim that the 14th Amend. protects them to - homosexuality must be an innate characteristic that people have no control of. Only then can homosexuals limit "discrimination" under the 14th Amendment.. . It is at this point that the origin or cause of homosexuality becomes relevant. If it is something beyond any human control - then this argues for 14th Amend. protection. However, if it is a "choice." Then 14th Amend protection for homosexuals may not be warranted.. . Unfortunately, I think the answer to the question of what causes homosexuality is more complicated and belies this simple classification.. . But that's just me. I could be totally wrong because I'm just a sillybuns. Take care hon and praise Allah!

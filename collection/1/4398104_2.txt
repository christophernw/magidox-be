Try jumping off a chair backwards and landing on your back on a house brick.   Your terninal speed will be less than five mile per hour.  . . When the the pain has subsided and the tears have dried up calculate the hurt by a factor of 10.   You will then have an indication of sliding backward into a kerb / car or whatever at about 50 mile per hour.. . Whilst the bruising heals you can start saving for some body armour.   Which won't make you bullet proof but might just enable you to feed yourself and wipe your own ass if ever you should have a bike crash.. . 5kN or 50kN it all hurts.

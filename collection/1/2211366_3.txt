Because there are no Nobel prizes for theoretical physics, only for applied physics. Alfred Nobel rigged the rules so that the prize had to be tied to an experimental result.. . There is a somewhat juicy and apocryphal story behind this odd rule. It is said that Nobel's wife had a not-very-well hidden affair with a famous mathematician. When setting up his prizes, Nobel asked around to see if it were possible that his rival might win a putative prize in mathematics. Everyone agreed that the man was brilliant and might easily win the prize. So Alfred decided there would be no Nobel Prize for mathematics.. . Then someone pointed out to Nobel that many mathematicians did excellent work in theoretical physics. So Nobel changed the rules of the physics prize to require an experimental result.. . As noted, Einstein did win a Nobel Prize, but it was for his work on an experimental result called the "Photoelectric Effect.". . And one more point, relativity is a very important result. It changed the face of physics. But just as important and perhaps even more earth-shaking was quantum mechanics. So I don't know if you can really say that it was the GREATEST discovery of the last century.. . If we look outside of physics there are even more great discoveries. I would argue, for example, that the greatest scientific work of the last century was discovering the structure and purpose of DNA.

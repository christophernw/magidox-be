Drosophila is a genus of small flies known commonly as fruit flies. There are many species and they have been extremely important for the development of genetics and evolutionary science. As they are easy to breed in the lab and their life cycle is very short, they have been used for many kinds of studies. Natural Drosophila populations have also been important for better understanding of population genetics and evolutionary forces.

In some cases chronic depression is caused by a persistant hormonal balance in the brain.  Chemistry, in particular the levels of certain neurotransmitters/hormones is very influential on emotional state -- this is why certain drugs give feelings of euphoria and other emotions.. . A good example of an uncontrollable emotional response to a change in body chemistry is if you've ever drunk too much coffee and find yourself unable to stop moving around, or feeling nervous and jittery.  Alcohol also has a similar, although opposite effect.. . Imagine if you felt drunk all the time -- only instead of being happy it was a bad drunk where you feel sad and hopeless and self-pitying.  In cases of chronic depression this isn't due to any external factor but simply a hormonal imbalance.  The only way to change the emotional state is to attempt to "balance" these hormones through the introduction of some other chemical, which often has immediate and astonishing effects.

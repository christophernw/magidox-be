http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/becker10.htm . don't make the common mistake of turning an ab workout into a cardio doing 100 crunches.  go run for 30 min if so.  you want to build the ab muscles and lean them out but doing 100 crunches isn't going to do this you have to lower your overall bodyfat % for that.

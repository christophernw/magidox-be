Tragedies happen for no particular reason. It is the law of averages. If you keep crossing intersections and you don't watch, you can do it for 200 times and brakes will squeel, but you won't get hurt. One day you will be hurt. Sickness is the same way. It sneaks up on a certain % of the population for no reason. There is less of this than any other time in the history of mankind. There is a lot of it in poorer countries even today, because  they don't have the technology. In the 18th century death was common with children. In the 20th it much less common. Has nothing to do with anything but science and technology.

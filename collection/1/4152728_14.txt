Ever seen One Flew Over the Coocoo's Nest?  In that movie, the man has nothing good in his life, no job, no house, no food, and so he fakes insanity so that he can be taken into a mental institution to live a better life.  I think that this is mostly a hollywood idea, but for the same reasons some people stay in jails on our tax dollars living for free.

Unless they want one, you can't. Sorry. You'll just have to wait until you are 18+ and living on your own, before you can make the decisions on pets in the household.. Until then, you'll say the animal is yours, but in all truth, your parents are the ones paying for the food/medical bills/etc. Therefore they're the ones responsible, and maybe they just don't want that right now.

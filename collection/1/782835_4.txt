You can't remember something if it doesn't MATTER to you. The key to remembering is to RELATE the fact to something that's important to you. For example, the word, "ciudad" in Spanish means city. Is that important to you? Say it..."Mio ciudad es Corpus Christi" or whatever. How could anyone remember meaningless facts? The key is to associate them with something meaningful. Good luck!

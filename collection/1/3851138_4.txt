Salt acts as a solute to the water. Solutes make it more difficult for ice crystals to form, and thus lower the freezing point as more energy is needed for the crystals to form. Instead of water having a freezing point of 32 degrees F (0 degrees C), the point is changed to a higher value and as a result the water melts at higher temperatures.

The base is minced beef cooked in a sauce like BBQ sauce. You can add carrots and onions brunoise to the beef. Then top with smooth mash potatoes and bake in the oven. You can add grated cheese before baking so there is a layer of soft molten cheese on top. Serve hot with rich gravy and green Petit Pois (Green Peas) and baby carrots. I lived in England for many years and it is a classic English dish. When it is done well, it is simply superb! Enjoy!

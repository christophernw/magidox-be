windmils in Holland (which was famous for them already in the 16th century)were to grind wheatgrain to flower for bread,. these mills were stone towers, with a frame work with adjustible sails to be sincronised with the wind and the turret could turn to follow the wind direction.. and the millers were the rich men of the middle class of those times. .  the design of these mills, made it to england with dutch settlers.. . today alternative method are used and the few that are left are private residences ,restaurants or tourist atractions. ,there maybe one or two still left that grind flower,but it would be more for educational purposes.. . in spain were also flower Windmills,these were made out of wood and had also sail cloth sails that could be adjusted depending the wind (and don quixote fought one of them ). . .and farmers borrowed the principal to pump water for drinking or irrigation ,but these are entirely different structures of metal and pipes. . the wind generators of today are not mills but are propellors that drive turbines to generate electricity ,they are not what is know as the Windmills.. . and all the people that say that wind mills were for power are wrong they were mills

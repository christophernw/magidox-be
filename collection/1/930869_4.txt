Another slant on the phrase:  Someone is selling a product, another person acts like he or she will help you out because you would never be able to sell a thing.  That would be patronizing the seller.. . Another example:  You are in a beauty shop, the beutician says "Oh honey, I can help you out!  (As though you had such terrible hair or whatever, that only she can make it look better.). That would be a condescending attitude and the customer would be thinking, don't patronize me!. . "Don't patronize me, I can walk," says the parapalegic when met with people who want to "do" for things he can manage on his own.

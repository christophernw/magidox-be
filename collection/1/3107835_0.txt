Some animals come out at night that dogs bark at like raccoons, coyotes, and possums.  Also, with reduced visibility dogs may find things more threatening because they can't sense them as well.  It could just be that during the day there are a lot of other things going on so you don't pay attention to the dogs barking as much as at night when it is fairly quiet.

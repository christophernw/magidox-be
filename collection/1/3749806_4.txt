Make them into a syrup; a simple method is to take some lemons, zest them (but keep the zest), slice them quite thin, place them in a layer on the bottom of a preserving jar, cover with an equal thickness of sugar, and repeat until the jar is full.. . The lemon juice will be absorbed by the sugar & create a thick liquid. This can be used with various fruits & herbs.  Good luck!!

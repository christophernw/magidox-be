Well, it's something about Karma.... Someone said ..."i had stated "what goes around, comes around". The cops said that could be though of as a threat. I said "really, then that means from the statement, that I intend to do her harm, and if that is the case, then the very saying itself being what comes around goes around means that I must have been physically harmed by her in the past in order for it to come back around. Therefore, you need to arrest me for threatening and her for committing harm (assault) on me. They stood there confused; I donâ€™t think the donuts were of the intelligence boosting sort.". . Another said ..."Usually people who say What comes around goes around means that they couldnt give a toss' and it was bound to happen. He was basically saying that people like us (who like differnt music) should deserve to get beaten up! ". . Another one said ..."What comes around, goes around" means that if I get a dirty deal, then I will give a dirty deal to others. If I get hatred, then I will give out hatred. However, "What goes around, comes around", puts you in control of your own destiny. If I give kindness, I will receive kindness. If I receive hatred, I can still give out kindness. Whatever we sow is what we will reap. If you plant tomatoes, you can expect to get tomatoes. However, if someone gives you thorns, you don't have to plant them at all. You have the power to control both what you give and recieve by determining what you will give first......... "

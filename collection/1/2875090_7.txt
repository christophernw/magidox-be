In physics, buoyancy is the upward force on an object arising from the displacement of the fluid (i.e., a liquid or a gas) in which it is fully or partially immersed. This force enables the object to float or to at least to appear lighter. Buoyancy is important for many vehicles such as boats, ships, balloons, and airships

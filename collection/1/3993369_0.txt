If you are positive that nothing out of the ordinary happened (such as the dog got into poison, or garbage) you can give him/her 1tbs Pepto or Imodium AD per pound with a syringe. Feed it a bland diet of plain chicken breast, scrambled eggs, cottage cheese..ect. Call your vet if it doent clear up in a day or two, or if it gets worse and is accompanied by vomiting.

If you have patience you might try placing an extra litter box in the tub when you're not using it for a period of a couple of weeks, to gradually encourage him to go in the litter. It's a good idea to keep the tub itself clean with bleach and deodorizer so he can't sniff where he's been. If that doesn't work, I think I would just accept his behavior as an inconvenience and learn to live with it.. . I'm so glad you don't believe in punishing the cat for this, or putting him outside. Cats are complicated creatures and have their own emotional problems sometimes, but in the end they're worth the trouble. We have to be very careful dealing with litter box problems, because sometimes punishment, scolding and that kind of thing can make the cat neurotic and the problem worse.

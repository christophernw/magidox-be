You know....you see words...sometimes people tend to think that "oh that kid is being a smart aleck or being disgusting or whatever"  Maybe when the person responds to that other person they mean well too. They are probably not meaning to come off as being rude. YOu really cannot judge that by things that you read. . . Everyone has the right to their own opinion. If someone really is being rude, then they are being rude. Unfortunately, it is a bad part of life. Everyone is different. How do you know it's the adults that are always slamming other kids? You don't know that for a fact. You honestly don't. You can't tell how old someone is by what they put down. . . There are things on here that YEAH they should be reported, but personally if I was going to report someone I would not broadcast it. I think that people do that to try to push their authority around and to try to use scare tatics. that is what I think. . At any rate.....people are the way they are. As long as you are not rude and as long as you think you are doing the right thing, then that's all that counts. don't worry about what's on another person's plate. Worry about your own. When that plate is empty of all of lifes flaws and troubles then you will have the right to go and correct someone else.

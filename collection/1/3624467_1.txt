There are a lot of theories - that we are getting in touch with our subconscious, that we are clearing bad happenings in our lives, that we are just clearing all the things we took in during the day.. . They do know for sure that you cannot live without sleeping, but it does take awhile (a year or more) before you will die from lack of sleep.

I believe people feel intimidated by the thought of learning a new or second language.  I know that when we lived in Belgium for 9 years, I HAD to learn the language there because I needed to be able to "function".  However, some that were in the same circumstance, only learned a few key words to get around.  If people would understand that it broadens their horizons a bit and even makes them stronger for attempting the challenge, I think they would not be so afraid to try.  I have learned that in most countries, it is necessary to take ENGLISH as a second language.  Some of them are forced to in their school system because of the realization by their government that society functions on more than "one level".

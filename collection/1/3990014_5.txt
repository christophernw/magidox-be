According to some stories the claim is because most figures in History are White.. . But as far as I am concerned there are a ton of Black people who are just as important to History as the White people in History.. . Im like seriously why do we need a Black History or White History Month.. . White History is American History. . Black History is American History. . Lets look at important persons in History not by their skin color but by their accomplishments.

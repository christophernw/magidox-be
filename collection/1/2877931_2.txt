Man, since hes was taken down something like 400 ppl have died in bombings and shit cause of the reactions due to his conviction. 400... he was convicted for the killing of 180 or something like that. Ummmmm wouldn't it be smarter to just not convict him and let those ppl live, bad to worse. iono You choose i mean yea im glad hes out of power, but its kinda like, maybe they should've hung him and not told anyone?

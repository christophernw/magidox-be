becuase of the may expensive creams, and flavors they use to make them, truffles most of the time are handmade too, which makes it more expensive. Also,thier a very popular delicacey. ut not all truffles are expensive. I went to a simple candy shop. filled with home made candies where the truffles were 38 cents each. that's not a bad price, and  thier delicious and creammy.

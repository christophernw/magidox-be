I would like to see some figures on that.  In the city I work in it does not matter about money.  We treat everyone the same.  Court is a different story.  Once I arrested a very wealthy man, I mean multi millionaire.  When he came to court the attorney he hired convinced the judge to have the charges dropped to a city ordinance so that the guy would not have a criminal record.  Then the judge looked at me and asked me if I had a recommendation for a fine.  So, right there in open court, for what should have been about a $300.00 fine for disorderly conduct, I said $4,000.00.  The guys attorney laughed out loud and said he thought that was quite steep.  That's when I got to speak my thoughts.  I told the attorney that his client was lucky that the judge even reduced the charges in the first place, then I told the attorney that if his client could afford to hire a high priced attorney like himself that I'm sure he could afford to pay a $4000.00 fine.  The judge even looked at me funny and I told the judge that the client's net worth was over $64 million and that $4K was a drop in the bucket.  The judge fined him the $4K.

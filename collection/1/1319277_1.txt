As vinod b stated, the "slogan" for the Nazi Party was "Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein FÃ¼hrer" ("One People, one State, one Leader").. . There were *many* other slogans used by the Nazis prior to and following their gaining of power in 1933 Germany.  Just take a look at the propaganda posters in my source(s).

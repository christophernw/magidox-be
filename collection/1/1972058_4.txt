There are different ways of changing the PH, but not too many are stable, and stability is most important.  Additives sold in the pet store tend to be unreliable because they don't change the reason why the water was high or low in the first place and it is a temperary adjustment.. . If you have high PH water it's most likely because you have a higher mineral content in the water.  If you lower it with chemicals then the minerals will drive the PH back up in time and the result is fluctuating ph, very stressful on the fish.  The only reliable way to handle this is to use a Reverse Osmosis filter, since it removes these minerals.    You can raise a low PH by adding the minerals into the water through the use of salts, easy, but you need to do it with every water change.. . In the end most fish are adaptable to a wide range of PH and the water should only be adjusted for the most delicate species, those that should be avoided by beginners anyway.  Also keep in mind that most of the fish we purchase have been bred in tap water and are already used to it.  If you truly want a successful tank, don't overcomplicate the process, as more complication means more can go wrong.

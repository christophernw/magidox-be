Wouldn't by definition "allow unlawful immigration" be an oxymoron?  The problem with the economy is not that we allow illegal immigrants, it is that we send work overseas and pay for everyone else's problems before solving our own, among other things. . . Coincidentally that is how everybody in this country got here by emmigrating to this country or their ancestors.. . Try not oversimplify the problems that we have in this country by blaming all of our problems on one group.

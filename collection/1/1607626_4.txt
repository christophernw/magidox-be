Let's say your dog gets run over.  You're sad.  Two weeks later, your best friend's dog gets ran over.  You have empathy for them, because you know what they're feeling. Two more weeks later, your cousin's hamster dies.  You're sympathetic, but you've never had a hamster die, so you don't know exactly what they're feeling.  Sympathy is feeling bad for a person.  Empathy is feeling what they feel.

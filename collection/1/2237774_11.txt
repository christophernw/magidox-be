you are either over or under cooking them,and that theory about adding  salt to the water when you boil them has no affect. i usually boil mine for 7 to 15 minutes depending on how many i have in the pot then cool them off and take a knife,use the side that's not sharp and tap them in a straight  line all the way around long ways and they peel fine. but i peel them when they are still warm.

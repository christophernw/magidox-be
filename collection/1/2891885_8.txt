I think people like them for the freedom they represent. Riding can be extremely relaxing.. They are lovely animals and all have different personalities.. I once wanted to breed Friesans, but now I'm not so sure.. When you spend time around horses, if you're like me, you want to spend more time around them, but you can't mind getting dirty. And they are a ton of work. You're supposed to clean their stalls daily.  I think if people realized just how hard a single horse is to take care of,many would change their minds. But they are fun.

your fico score reflects many items including whether you have open accounts and also if you have balances compared to open credit. if you close that card then max out the new one w/ the better rate, that puts you in the identical situation creditwise.  if you leave it open and use it and pay it off bit by bit, then it will make your fico score rise.

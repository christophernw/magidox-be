There's no telling. I wondered myself. But Nagin did at least figure out quick that he was unable to provide the needed relief and tried to get FEMA to help for a whole week before they showed up. I think he actually cared, which is more than I can say for the rest of them.. . Did you know that FEMA and the federal government kept rescue relief from getting there all that time? A group of people even managed to order 5 buses and the feds prevented the buses from getting to the people so they could leave. And then when this same group of people tried to cross a bridge to leave the city, after they figured out that no help was coming, the police fired guns at them telling them to get the {explicit word} off the bridge.. . The majority of the city was blacks, so why should blacks care if their mayor is prejudiced against whites?

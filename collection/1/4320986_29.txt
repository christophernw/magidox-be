Whaddya mean, immoral acts would benefit me? Perhaps give a shallow feeling of gratification in the short term, but in order to biuld a society in which others refrain from such acts I must refrain from them myself.. . Not that difficult - material possessions are shiny, granted, but the whole money-chasing thing seems like a pointless waste of the one life I'm given.

I'm in the same place, and have been for years.  I go from being sad and depressed to utterly raging in anger, and have absolutely no control over it.  I'm currently in the process of having myself diagnosed, possibly with bipolar disorder.  I'm not saying that you have it, but what I am saying is this;. . Grab the bull by the horns!  Talk to your husband about it, let him know how you feel.  He will understand.  Then go and see your doctor.  He/she will not be able to diagnose you fully, but will notify a consultant and refer you.  I am seeing mine next week for the first time.  Even though I have not yet been diagnosed, I feel MUCH BETTER having started the process, and even more so having started the process myself.. . Don't wait until something happens, or until it becomes unbearable.  Please!!!  By tackling this problem, you will feel stronger, and your loved ones WILL support you.  I promise you that!. . You can always mail me if you need any support!. . Oh and by the way, you are completely NORMAL!!!! :-). . Take very good care!

The Bible proves itself thru prophecy, you may want to do a web search on Bible prophecy, pay special attention to the dates it was prophesied and the dates it was fulfilled with 100% accuracy, also do web searches on the Bible and History, the Bible and archeology, and science and the Bible, and the homosexual deal isn't in the ten commandments it is in the scripture it says that a man shall not lay with another man as he lays with a woman for it is a abomination to God, it also says that a man shall leave his mother and cleave to his wife, also this is why Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed

Right now, we're just having a little tiff with the French.  Viewed from the long perspective of history, it's just a little lover's spat.. . The problem isn't so much that Americans don't appreciate the French, it is that the French have begun ridiculing and denigrating us.. . Even worse, France (along with Russia, and to some extent, Germany) was bribed by Saddam Hussein in the Oil For Food scandal.  Saddam was covertly paying them huge amounts of money in order to avoid real action by the UN Security Council.  Had these countries been firm with Iraq, we probably wouldn't have had to go to war with Iraq.  Saddam would have had to cooperate, but he figured he could buy them off indefinitely, and eventually our attention would be distracted.. . England is best friend in Europe, but countries like the Czech Republic have been good allies too.

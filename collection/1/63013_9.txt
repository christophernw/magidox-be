I don't know who wants to pay more for water? And besides that it really isn't good for kids unless you buy fluriode treated water. Kids need the fluriode for good teeth and tap water comes treated with that (as long as it isn't well water). I'm serious about this, be warned. Kids who have grown up on bottle water are more likely to have more cavatities and tooth decay. So, think about that the next time you reach for aquafina or whatever other bottle water you drink.

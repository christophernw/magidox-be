There are lots of reasons -- and it may be more than one reason. Growth spurts, illness, allergies, headaches, stress, depression, jet lag, adjusting to medication, SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) -- I had my worst ever case last May, when we had 3 weeks of nonstop rain! -- nursing a baby, pregnancy, certain days during the monthly cycle, & "kicking" caffeine are just a few. Generally if there's no fever I wouldn't worry about it -- just give your body & mind what they need.

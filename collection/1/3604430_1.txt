Heat is the kinetic energy of molecular motion. The molecules of a hot object are in rapid motion; the hotter, the higher the average speed and the greater the thermal energy. If the object is gaseous the motion consists of free-path travel and collisions with other molecules. If it is liquid the paths between collisions are shorter, and if solid the motion is vibrational with no secular movement.

I like using tea leaves because there is a theroy that every one subconsoiusly knows what there future is and with tea leaves your mind uses matrixing and basicaly it is the same as taking an you ink blot test, you see something but you dont allways know what it means untill you look it up.. I also like to think of a specific question that i want answered or what i want to look into and randomly pick up a book , a page, and a parragraph. I like using poem books, or my favorite physics book (dont ask). I also like using a bead on a string and ask it questions to divine.

The key to your question is in the word itself..holidays, i.e. holy days.. . Like the words Christmas and Halloween which have changed from Christ mass and All Hallows' E(v)en(ing), the word used to be Holy days.. . Religious festivals were begun to honor the gods....or God. In the case of Passover, Holy Thursday, it is obvious. Military celebrations in ancient Rome often were occasions to give thanks to the gods for victories.

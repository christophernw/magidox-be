Okey according to what they teach us in school this is what they tell us about contacts and kids wearing them. usually its when the kid is responsible, since you have to clean your contacts every day, but if your parents can afford it there are these contacts that you can throw away every night they are called Acuvue one a day, you wear them one day and you throw them out; so you dont have to clean it. So, when a kid becomes responsible around 12 or so. Girls are usually younger than boys, but usually around 12. There area  lot of other factors to consider when wearing contact lenses.  There are some things in your eye that the doctor has to look at to make sure that you are a good candidate for contact lenses, like if your eyes dont get dry too easily etc etc. they know what to look for. Also the shape and the size of your eye has to get measured so they know which contact lens will be appropriate for your eye.. Boys like girls w/ and without glasses. If a boy likes you, he should like you with and without glasses. Contacts are great for sports and for people who's glasses are very thick *like if you have a lot of prescriptio in your glasses, sometimes contacts can make you look much nicer.  So, go see your eye doctor and see what he says.  And remember that boys will like you for who you are, and if they dont they are not worth it!

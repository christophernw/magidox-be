You can do this way. Boil water,not so hot. Add robb to the water by melting it. Put your face over the bowl containing the water and cover your head with a blanket..allow the steam to go through your nose(make sure you remove blanket when you cant take it any more because it goes directly)then after like 2mins remove blanket and there should be a good result

A mythical beast.. . I am not sure if a gentleman ever existed, but I do know others attempted to emmulate this gentleman creature with often poor results.  In todays day and age, if one ever spots a gentleman, they are instructed to shoot it quickly by order of the woman's movement aggenda.  Such a monster is not allowed to exist, holding open doors for women (as they can not open them themselves), carrying heavy objects (as the woman is purely a feeble creature and unable to lift anything over 15 pounds), and work gender specific jobs (such as carpentry and metal fabrication (as all women can not even begin to understand the relation of the hammer to the nail)

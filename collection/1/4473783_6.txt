I just want to add to this confusion somehow.  ich is like what you say when you touch an unknown slimy substance. liebe is way beyound me to even guess at how to pronouce.  but dich is like dick.  Oh! I am going to give liebe a shot   like lee  and what passes as the pronounciation of 'B' in english ( it is not the name of this letter but how you would explain its pronounciation.)  By the way ich habe keine aunung !

If your point is we should direct our focus on providing more charity for the poor, then generally I agree.  However, if you look at historical impact of chartiy, it doesn't have such a great record.  The whole world has been involved in some sort of charity or another, yet there are still poor people in the world, and quite frankly the number has increased.. . What is needed is a new approach to help people break out of poverty.  The only proven method that I have seen work is the brain child of the guy who recently won the Nobel Peace prize.  His name is Muhammad Yunnus.   In the 1970's, working as an economics professor in Bangladesh, he became frustrated that none of the policies really worked for the poor.. . So he decided to examine the situation himself and learned that giving out tiny loans to very poor people at very low interest rates gave those people financial freedom.   I am talking about loans in the amount of $20 to $30.  This may seem nothing to us, but in a third world country this is a small fortune.. . In any case, over 30 years later, he has successfully loaned out over $5 billion with a 98% loan pay back rate and pulled millions of people out of poverty.. . The point is that hand outs don't work, you have to enable people to break out of poverty themselves.  It gives them self esteem and generates more confidence in themselves.. . This is the kind of program we need in the US.. . Here is a link to a story about him:. . http://www.pbs.org/opb/thenewheroes/meet/yunus.html

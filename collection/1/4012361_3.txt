Bring her inside.  The best cats are house cats.  Less trouble to get in.  . . Make sure she has a bed to have her kittens.  A box and blanket is fine.  When the kittens are 6-8 weeks old put an ad in the paper for the kittens.  . . Charge a small fee like $5.00 this will pay for the cost of the ad and extra money to help with the cost to have her spayed.  Best to get shots before she has her kittens.

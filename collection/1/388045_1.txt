That's "an" electronic combination lock.. . And "have" to either pick the electronic.... . And ATM stands for Automated Teller Machine (or Automatic Teller Machine) in which case saying "atm machine" is redundant.. . Considering your lousy command of the English language, I think you SHOULD try to break into that ATM.  Try using a blowtorch and crowbar.. . You DO know that all ATMs have cameras installed, right?

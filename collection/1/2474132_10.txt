Word of mouth, and patience. I used to take my VW Jetta to a different mechanic each time, hoping that one day I would find a good one. Finally, on the recommendation of a friend, I took it to a dinky little garage in Chicago that I would never have gone into on my own, and told him about my chronic overheating problem. Unlike every other mechanic who had looked at it, he quoted a low price ($25 installed!), told me the specific part that needed to be fixed (without looking at the car!) and when he swapped the part, it was *fixed*. For good. Never had the problem again.. . That guy kept my Jetta running years longer than it should have, and always charged me a reasonable price. Keep looking until you find someone you're comfortable with, and who can simply fix the car -- that's the most important thing, right? Cheap prices don't matter if they can't fix the problem in the first place.

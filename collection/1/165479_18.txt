In the not so nice sense they're usually considered to be: . . People missing multiple teeth, not taking care of themselves or their homes (grease, cockroaches everywhere, etc), speaking with so much southern twang and slang as to be considered unable to understand and/or ignorant. . . . In the loud and proud sense: . . Anything involving cowboy boots, wrangler jeans, stetsons, country music, southern accents south of Virginia and as far west as Texas, rodeos, shotguns (full length, not sawed off variety XD), hound dogs, and possessing one or more cheating ex wives.

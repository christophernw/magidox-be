Vegetarian does not equal vegan.  Vegans do not eat any animal products (ie- eggs, milk, and cheese are off limits to vegans).  Vegetarians do not eat meat, but still eat eggs, milk, and cheese.  Most vegetarians and vegans choose their lifestyles for reasons other than the environment.  For example, I am a vegetarian and I do it because I find the conditions of commercial farms appauling.  I also do it for health reasons.

I think the best way to approach this situation is like this. First, did you intentionally run over his dog? Probably not. Secondly, did the dog dart out in front of your car therefore not giving you sufficient time to swerve out of the way? Possibly. Answer those two questions and I think your answer is clear. . . You may not be a malicious person. Therefore, you probably didn't meant to run over his dog. This makes you a reasonable person. Go and talk to your neighbor. You're both grown ups and should start acting as such. Try to find out if the dog was your neighbor's best companion. Learn a little about the dog, your neighbor and you may find out a little about yourself in the process. Your neighbor will see that this was indeed an accident. There is nothing that can be done to bring the dog back. However, there is something you can do to rebuild a relationship with your neighbor. You never know, one day you may need your neighbor in your time of need.

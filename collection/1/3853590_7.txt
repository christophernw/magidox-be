I think that any form of bigotry should be avoided. . I don't think that most people are against Judaism. The other religions are accepting of everyone and Judaism isnt something that you can just convert to. . Jews have throughout history been an easy target of the Governments that have created internal strife to strengthen the will and unity of others against them. The Romans Soviets and Nazis are only three examples. This is using the differences of people to unite them in defense or as a scapegoat people. . The Gypsies have suffered the same fate. . But because of their long history and strict beliefs which are different than most. The Jews have been an undeserving but easy target. I applaud all that they have survived and endured. . . I believe in God!. I don't condone judgment against any religious group or race!. I think the world is in need of Compassion, Mercy, and Forgiveness daily.. . It is a Great day to be alive!!. . Good luck and God Bless!!

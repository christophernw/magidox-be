Your best option would be a degree in Communications or Journalism.  Look for a four-year program from an accredited university, preferably one that will offer you a Co-op placement (where you work and get paid at a real magazine during the summer).  You'll also want to look for opportunities to showcase your writing skills, from writing for the local newspaper to publishing an intelligent blog.

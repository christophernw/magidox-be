For one, it is too difficult to monitor who is registered, who is legal, and who has already voted. For two, if you're too lazy to get your sorry bum to the polls one day a year, you really don't deserve to vote (especially since there are options for the home-bound and people who simply cannot make it for non-laziness related issues -- early voting and mail). And this doesn't even mention the fact that voting is supposed to be private and secret.

I have that same pouch,from having two children. I recently purchased a Cross-Crunch.It works pretty good!We also have an Ab lounge sport!They are awesome,and they really work!My daughter,who is only like 8.Does 100 situps a night on that thing.And she has lost six inches in her waste!In about 2 mths.I had to take her out and buy her all new clothes.I love the ab lounge sport.Cuz,it gets you up off the floor!And it's fairly cheap,I think I spent 99$ for it.And it's great for people who have back or neck problems!I am working on my stomach!Because I had two emergency C-sections,With both of my daughters.Who are 12 and one is 8!Did you ever try 6 second abs?I was wondering how that works?Is 8 min abs the same thing?Well,anyhow Good-Luck,And congradulations on your wedding!You can do it!

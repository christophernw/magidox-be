First off, ovarian cysts are normal.  If you didn't develop cysts, you would be unable to ovulate and have babies.  Most ovarian cysts will go away with your menstrual cycle.  If you had both a trans-abdominal and trans-vaginal ultrasound, and it showed that the cysts were "simple cysts" with no malignant characteristics, you can be nearly 100% true that is the case.  Ultrasound is an excellent way to evaluate ovarian cysts, and it is very accurate.. . Secondly, these cysts can grow and it can become very uncomfortable and even painful. When a cyst builds up pressure, it can rupture.  Usually, the pain will subside after a rupture because the pressure is relieved.  But, your symptoms could be totally unrelated to the ovarian cysts.  The flank pain (back pain) could very well be related to the renal system (UTI, hydronephrosis).  Your pain could also be caused by the appendix or other digestive system problems.  . . So, you should call your doctor.  Your doctor may request another ultrasound to see if your cysts have grown.

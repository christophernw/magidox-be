A guilty conscience is when we do something that we know we shouldn't, and is wrong, and we keep thinking about what we have done without getting a moments peace...our thoughts are focused on this one thing constantly being reminded, and we worry about consequence.. . No conscience is when we have no concern for others, or ourselves, and even if we do a wrong we feel no responsibility for it or for others, we feel no remorse, basically the idea of doing something wrong does not register in our minds, as being wrong,  and we care nothing about consequence.

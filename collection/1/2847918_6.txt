Hi,. Good Question .  Asthma is a lung condition that causes wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. It is triggered by irritants or some allergen, like - cold air, viruses, tobacco smoke, dust, pollen, moulds, and animal dander. Some people have coughing or wheezing only during exercise (called exercise-induced asthma). . . An asthma attack may last a few minutes or for days. Attacks can happen anywhere and at any time. It is very important to get treatment for asthma to live a healthy, active life. . . The Asthma occurs due to folloing reasons.. . In asthma, the lining of the airways in the lungs is swollen, even when there are no symptoms. When exposed to irritants or allergens, the airways become more swollen and begin to make excess mucus. The tiny muscles in the walls of the airways begin to contract. These reactions decrease the airway openings, making it harder for air to move in and out. The whistling sound of air moving through the narrowed air passages is called wheezing. The extra mucus in the airways causes coughing. . . The symptoms . . The patient has difficulty in breathing, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and tightness in the chest.. .  A breathing test or a lung function test may also be done. This may be done before and after taking medication to measure the response to medication. A single attack of wheezing or difficulty in breathing is not always asthma. Certain infections and some chemicals can cause wheezing, which lasts for a short time and then does not occur again. . . . . Feel Free To Contact. Enjoy Life. Dr.Mojo

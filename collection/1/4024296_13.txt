well, in the english language skills, we have four namely listening, speaking, reading, and writing. speaking and writing are outputs of listening and reading. we canot speak or write without any idea or knowledge on something which we acquire from listening and reading. therefore, listening and reading are very essential in becoming and developing a great writer unless God gave you the TALENT on it but even if you have already the "talent" on it, still it's a humbling thing to develop or hone more ones talent for God's glory. Bring back the glory to him!

This is a good question. Some people don't even read the Bible.. Churches today are business like, congregations in them are getting low.. Those who were flooded were warned by the Angels of God.. The destruction of the deluge was an order from God.. A God that loves us so much.. If it didn't took place (The Great Deluge) we probably are much worse than Crucifying the Son of God, Jesus Christ.

Well, you don't ask for much, do you?. . Have you ever heard of the Pax Romana?  That's the term that was given (in Latin, since that was their language) by the Romans to what they were doing in building their empire:  they were bringing the Roman Peace to the world.  And that's what peace would be for much of the world: surrender to a dominant authority.. . No, thanks.  I prefer Liberty.. . Different countries have different ideas of how they should live, who should rule, what laws are just, etc.  If you want peace all over the world, the only way I can see would be for one country to dominate all the others, and impose its will on all the world.  What country is honorable enough, and bound by just enough laws, for that to be a good thing?  And what country has the military and economic power to enforce such a dominance?  . . Do the answers to those questions frighten you?  No?  They should!  America is the only country that could conceivably impose its will to that extent.  I live in America, and I would not want George Bush, or anyone elected by the American people the way they are now, to rule the world.  I love my country, I think our Constitution is the best, but we are nowhere near honorable enough to be trusted with world domination.  We don't stick to the principles in our Constitution well enough just running this country, let alone the whole world.

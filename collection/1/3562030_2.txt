Best looking car in its class. much better than the Fiesta, and has a little more space inside as well. Giugiaro has done a great job.. But the engine feels rough and underpowered, especially the 1.4, and the gearbox shifting is not a patch on the Fiesta. Expect GM spares to be cheaper than Ford (definitely) and Honda. Why do you want a sedan?

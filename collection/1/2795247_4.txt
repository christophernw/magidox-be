I dont understand it either. I think its because they want to keep the gays at arms length because if they really took the time to get to know one they might like them and have to question their faith.  I think deep down they know there is nothing wrong with it but they are too lazy to question their doctrine. Basically they are bullies and want everything their way. The most extreme want a new social order, thats why they talk about "materialism" all the time - unfortunately the new social order doesn't include gays.

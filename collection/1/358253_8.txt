Ok so how do you know they don't? lol. And perhaps you are a little mixed up with regard to magic itself.  What YOU imagine when you think of "magic" may be something entirely different to a wiccan's definition of magic.  Are you sure you understand exactly what the wiccan's are referring to when they mention magic?  Perhaps not.. It is to your credit that you call a spade a spade when you feel you have seen a spade.  It shows strength of character and I applaud you for it.  But don't forget that sometimes in life, between the black and white are many shades of grey.... Namaste,. from A. x

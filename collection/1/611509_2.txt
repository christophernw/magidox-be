I used to run register at a grocery store, then moved to another and ran the front office and that isn't ANY better.  When I moved to a big chain store and applied for the job, I said 'nightshift, NO front end work, all I want is stock.'  Being a cashier has got to be the crappiest job in the world.  That's why some appear to be in a bad mood when you get to their register, and upon seeing that some customers just blow up because they expect to have a perfect customer service experience.  What some don't get is that those in the service industry ARE human too and are at WORK and probably don't want to be there.

Sin is the affect of an earlier problem.Sin occurs mainly after temptation has been acted upon by our spirit and body.Sin is something that if not repented of will lead to death not in the bodily sense alone but spiritual as well."The second death" as it is called is what punishment is aquired for the acummulation of unrepented sin.Actually if a person is baptized into Christ and has repented and living the Christian life as best they can there will still be sin.Thing is we then have the privledge to ask forgiveness of sins as long as we try not to sin which is what repent actually broken down means.To turn from sin.Sin actually is no worse than another sin for instance Christ only really spoke of one and that is blasphemy and it is the worst of all.Sexual sin is a biggy but only because when you are baptized into Christ's body then you have the holy spirit within you.So having sex you are involving the holy spirit which lives inside of you which is definetly not good.Sin for the most part is equal.For instance some so called christians say that homosexuality is worse than other sins but in reality if I looked upon a woman sexually it is no worse than if a man looks at another man that way or vice versa.Just remember that sin is an act not something we are born with as calvinists and catholics believe.A baby that cannot walk talk or have sex cannot sin!Therefore it doesnt need baptism as a baby as they say besides a baby cannot confess Christ as Lord nor repent of sins for it has none.Hope this helps

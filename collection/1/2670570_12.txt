The answer to your question is Politics. One of the two main political parties has their man in the oval office. The other party must run everything into the ground to make the sitting party look bad..         The Republicans are in right now, so the Democrats must criticize anything and everything to make the Republicans look bad, giving Democrats running for office a better chance of rounding up more votes. Truth is of no importance to a politician..         If the Democrat party gets their people in office, will the economy improve ? No way, everything they do will be criticized by the Republicans. There's no escape. This has been going on since and before the early days of my long life. There's no way out. It's the worse possible method of electing government officials in the whole world, except for all the others.

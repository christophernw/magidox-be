You dip the metal you want plated into a solution containing ions of the metal you want to plate with, such as chromium (chrome).  The dipped metal is attached to an electrical current, which induces a redox reaction.  The actual chemistry is a little more complicated, but the easy version is that those metal ions become solid metal attached to the electrode (the metal that you dipped in the solution).  The new metal is now permanently bonded to the old metal, and you have a set of chrome rims.

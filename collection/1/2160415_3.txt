My best suggestion is to skim through all the pages, and take notes on a sheet of paper on the important highlights. Or, take the highlights, and put random questions onto index cards, and quiz yourself. This is a great study tool, and works like flashcards. Also, if you have any notes, it is a scientifically proven fact that rewriting notes is like reading it 11 times.

Wow, Holy analog, Batman!. This question only applies to wind-up analog watches and print advertisment.. On an analog watch face, 10:10 makes a "Vee" and shows the hands, the quarter-hour positions and all the numbers (with the 10 and 2 only partially obscured). Watch vendors determined that this was "the" way to show the faces and it became standardized as a market tradition. This has carried over as a tradition to digitals in print adds (not always, but often) showing the "10:10". Of course, since they are battery operated nowadays, most watches show "correct time."

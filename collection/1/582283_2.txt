The question is, why would you want to do this?   . . This will not increase your fuel economy (and will likely decrease it).  The water doesn't burn so it doesn't release energy like the gasoline will.   Yes, an engine may be able to TOLERATE some water in its fuel, but you aren't going to be able to cheat and get it to go farther by diluting the gas.

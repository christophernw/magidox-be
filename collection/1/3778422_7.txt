You should talk to your Doctor. Migraines are taken seriously anymore and there are plenty of medications to help control them. I have had them for 15 years since I was 15 years old and have had no success treating them myself or with all the different pain meds I was put on..  I would get 3-4 a week at the worst. . I finally talked to a new Dr. last year and was put on daily preventative medication called Topamax and I have not had one migraine in almost 7 months.. It is so nice not to deal with them anymore.. Ask your Dr. about all the different options. Believe me life is much more enjoyable when you are not stuck in bed in pain all the time.. . Good Luck!

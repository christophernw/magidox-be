This is not a correct question. 'Vegetable' is NOT a scientific term. This is a culinary term that broadly describes any fresh plant part and that may or may not be a fruit itself. For example eggplant is a fruit and a vegetable. Potato is a stem and a vegetable. Carrot is a root and a vegetable. Do you get it?

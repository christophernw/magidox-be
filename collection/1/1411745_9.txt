Because God fore ordained that because of sin only a pure sacrifice would be acceptable. Sin requires punishment. Most people think though that they can presuppose upon the grace of God and that he will do just that, forgive them when they die. . . By the Lord Jesus Christ paying the price for our sin, we now have a responsibility to live for him because he is the only one that can free from the bondage of sin. Besides that, if God said you're forgiven without any price being paid we wouldn't take sin seriously and think that sin is no big deal. By the Lord dying, it shows us just how awful sin really is and what it does, it destroys. Sin will destroy all of us one day. Ten out of ten people die. The question is will sin destroy your body only because you have repented of your sin, or will it destroy body and soul because you have thought sin isn't that bad and you don't need to repent?. . Something for you to think about.

It is not as bad as childbirth (from what I'm told). Nor is it as bad as a kidney stone (from what I'm told).. . However it is the worst pain you have ever felt (apart from those two above) together with a deep sense of nausea, and a strong urge to be a fetal ball for the rest of your life... . . :). .

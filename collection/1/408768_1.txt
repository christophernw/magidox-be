I think when people have found a good thing they want to share it with others...the one thing that "proselytizers" don't always get is that when you force your belief system on someone else it can be construed as not respecting the other person's beliefs...this is insulting to the person.  Another issue is that someone is not likely to change their core beliefs because of a logical argument...religious ideas are usually deeply held and emotional...a logical argument is never going to change an emotionally held belief...nor is an emotional argument going to change a decision arrived at using logic...I personally think we all need to find our own path...

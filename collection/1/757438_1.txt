Car insurance is required by ALL countries.  It's a measure of protection for other motorists.  If you have an accident, and are found at fault, your insurance pays for it.  Your insurance (dependent on type), will pay for damages done by natural causes, or damage by hooligans.. . Sorry, I can't help you with the cheapest companies in the UK.. . The benefits are you don't have to pay medical bills and damage reparations for an accident that is caused by you.

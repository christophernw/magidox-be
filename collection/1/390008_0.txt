keep your feet clean and dry constantly, if your socks get sweaty, change them to a clean, dry pair. Try getting new sneakers too if they smell bad, or if they get sweaty after playing leave them outside with the laces undone so they can air out and dry. And also after playing sports wash your feet in the tub and dry them then put clean dry socks on.

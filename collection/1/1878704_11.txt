It is a book that was just made into a movie-it is fiction- but hidden in D'vinci's paintings is a code that when they de-sifer it claims to be proof that Christ was a mere mortal and the whole consept of him being the son was God was a haux.. Some want to expose the Hoax to the world and others want to protect the secret so that religion stays in tact.. I need to see the movie to get the whole story but that's the basics.

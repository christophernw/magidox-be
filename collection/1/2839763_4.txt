Hi "Just Me". IÂ´ve had both. Anxiety is like being really nervous the whole time. Panic attacks as it name says is an attack. People who suffer from panic attacks have to conditions, first unbalance brain neurotrasmiters and second a spirit attached to his aura that once in a while attacks. When you feel this attack your heart starts bumping really fast, you cannot breath, you get really dizzy, you do not feel blood circulation in your legs and you feel panic or feeling like getting crazy. I hope this helped. Argentox2@yahoo.com

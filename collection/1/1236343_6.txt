I am an Atheist, and I am not empty inside. If I have an opinion, then I give it, and if I am curious, then I ask questions. I do not start trouble, and I do not try to offend anyone. I have defended religion in some answers, and I have stated that I feel that religion can be a good thing in some cases. I can be a spiritual person without believing in god. I am, and always will be a curious person, and will follow my mind wherever it leads. If it happens to lead me to an understanding, even if the person answering or asking feels or believes differently than I, then I have not wasted my time. If someone attacks Atheists in general, then I will defend my beliefs. There is nothing that I want from anyone. I am very content, and I hope that anyone, no matter what their belief system or religion, can say the same.

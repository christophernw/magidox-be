The DaVinci Code is a novel written by Dan Brown. The story is about a 'conspiracy' where the answers are found in clues left by famous people like DaVinci. It claims that the grail was not a cup, but a person, and also challenges readers by giving the idea that Jesus was married & had children. You need to read the book to get the full jist of it. I would recommend the version with the visual aids. It's pretty sweet.

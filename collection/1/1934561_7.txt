People usually begin with accepting what other people say as honest, straight foreword, and true.  As the years go by and they gain experience to which they can compare what others say, their acceptance of what others say diminishes.  That is, they become increasingly discriminating.  . . Part of that learning process should come from the schools as in teaching how to think, how to develop facts, how make conclusions, how to research what others have concluded in the past.  This teaching process of the schools has diminished during the last 30 to 40 years.  . . As an increasing percentage of the population has a lessening of this discriminating capability, they become easy prey for those who are spin artists and out and out propagandists and the demigod wannabes.  . . A lot of the questions and answers here in Yahoo Answers are for fun.  With the person putting in the question or answer knowingly making them a little silly or even trying to poke fun at others (a difficult thing to do with the written word).  However, it is clear that there is a significant number who don’t know, and most critically, apparently aren’t interested in learning.  . . Knowledge is power.  The more you learn the more powerful you are in terms of controlling your own life.  With knowledge comes the power to do something to change that element in your life that you don’t like.  While none of the answers here are in depth, they do point toward sources of gaining additional knowledge.  All you have to do is follow the path.

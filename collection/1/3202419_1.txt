The difference between a bank and a credit union is membership fees.  Most credit unions require you to keep a minimal amount in a savings account to have a checking account.  Credit unions also can provide more options for you, such as car, home or vacation, christmas clubs.  Credit unions are owned by the members, who are the shareholders.   HOwever, most credit unions only allow a certain percentage point on loans, in that case, banks may allow you better rates.  Banks have better CD rates usually, due to more customers.  If you hold a credit union account you are a member.  To open a credit union account you have to open a savings account and checking account.  Keep at least $50 to $100 at all times in the savings account.  ATM Charges are another reason to go with a bank over a credit union.  Credit unions have less offices and ATM's, however, banks like Wachovia are all over.  No charges on ATM transactions are nice and add up quickly when you use them as much as I do.. . Good luck and good day.. . David.

This question assumes that your interest rate is fixed for the life of the loan.  The the interest rate combined with the amount you have borrowed (the principal) all work together to make sure you pay back the principal within a certain amount of time (say 20 years = payback period).  Payments are generally a mix of interest & principal. therefore, when you first make a payment, the interest is calculated on the entire amount of principal, so the interest payment is at its highest here.  Part of that payment likely goes to pay off some principal.  Therefore, your second interest payment is calculated on a slightly smaller base principal amount, and so on until by the last payment, there is very little principal left, so the calculated interest will be much smaller!  make sense?

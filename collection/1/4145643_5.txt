What are your objectives? The Canine Good Citizen Test is a good model. You want your dog to walk on a loose leash, pay attention to you, come when called... There are lots of methods but the head-space is the same. Establish yourself as leader of the pack. Understand your dog does not think like you do. Timing is everything! reward your dog with water, food, and affection. Check-out classical and operant conditioning. You are already "training" your dog. Your dog is learning what is acceptable and what his/her place is in the pack. Not training is training. Good-luck, I hope you find some useful info.

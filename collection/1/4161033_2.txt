If she has established a residence there then I think you will need to go through the actual eviction process. Your local court should be able to help you with that. The situation will be easier if her name is not on your lease/mortage (I don't know if it is or not...just making a comment). You could just tell her to get out but if she is receiving mail there then she has all right to be there until there is an actual eviction.

to sweat means - lets say you have onions - to sweat them you are heating them up on low heat till they become translucent.. . . deglaze-  deglaze is when you use the little bits in a frying pan leftover from , say ,  steak- you then add a liquid to that while the pan is still on on the stove. about med high should do. make sure to scrape up all the tasty bits on the bottom. that is where you get most of the good flavor.

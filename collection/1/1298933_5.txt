Well, I guess you want to hear first of all about the tragedies and comedies played in Greece when Romans had no culture yet. The Latins developed the comedy later on, so we could say they owe it to Greeks.. Then, the art, way before the Roman empire, had reached its perfection in Greece. Even the Latin religious system was borrowed and adapted from them.. . That's way I agree with the idea they were "followers", from above.. . Later on, they "conquered" even Europe, by their rules of symmetry (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classicism).

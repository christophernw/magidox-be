If he kept barking at the same part of the ceiling and became upset, maybe there is something dead in your attic.  . . Maybe something outside was casting an ominous looking shadow on the ceiling.  People think dogs only see black and white.  This is not exactly true.  They don't see color as vividly as we do, but they do see it, so they can distinguish shadows.  . . Try bringing him back into the room during the day and see how he acts.  If he's still weird, check the attic for dead mice.  If he's fine, it's probably a shadow on the ceiling.  If you can't do something to change the lightplay, he may just have to sleep in your room.

You could say the nucleus is everything to a cell.. . -It controls cell division-a cell without a nucleus cannot reproduce because the nucleus contains chromosomes which hold all the 'information' about a cell.. -It basically controls all the metabolic activities of the cell, like the type of enzymes to be produced, protein synthesis etc.. -In doing this, the nucleus determines what a particular cell will be like e.g. a guard cell; root hair cell. Without a nucleus, I guess all plant cells would be identical because they wouldn't know what each of their function is.

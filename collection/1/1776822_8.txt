Jehovah's Witnesses believe they have to knock on every door to tell every person about Jehovah.  They have a very interesting twist on the bible not to mention the fact that they believe Jesus and Satan were brothers.  Satan, Lucifer was an angel...Jesus is the Son of God.  . . So, just be kind, simply don't answer the door or just ask them to stop coming to your door.  Most will respect that but if they presist just ignore them.  Getting upset with them doesn't benefit anyone. They are used to  being rejected, they can handle a, "no thank you."

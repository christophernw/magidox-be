First of all, if she told you about it it's a good sign.  This means she has it on her mind but is looking for a way out.  Just love her.  Encourage her.  If she told you it means she trusts you and speak to her about getting help.  She may not want anyone else to know, sometimes a stranger is the best person to help.  There are many trained professionals for this type of problem.  And remember, time heals all.  Tell her that.  Get her some help.  If she refuses, you may have to get it without telling her.  Good luck.

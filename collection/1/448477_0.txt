partial pressure of oxygen in your arterial blood (not venous). normal range would be around 80 to 100 mmhg (millimeters of mercury). for somebody suffering from COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) we lower the criteria to 60 because we don't want to over-oxygenate them. they have a condition that will trap carbon dioxide in their lungs -- and that will lead to respiratory acidosis (acidic pH in the blood).

most interviews are boring.  don't focus on what they are asking as much as focus on what you can tell them about yourself.  if you go into an interview chatty and friendly then they won't even ask you 1/2 the stupid questions. maybe thats just me though.  i like to think of interviews as psych exams.  so if you just be normal you are doing better than most -- trust me on that one -- there are some freaks out there.

unfortunately anti-illegal immigration advocates throw terms like "beaner" and "wet back" around. that is why it's turning into a racial issue. in addition, a lot of these same people generalize immigrants and assume that brown=illegal. or that immigrant= Mexican. the ignorance being spewed by people forces the focus away from illegal immigration to racial profiling

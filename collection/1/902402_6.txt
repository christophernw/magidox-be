People just believe in creationism because they find it simple and easier to wrap their little brains around. They refuse to accept the actual truth that evolution is what brought us here. Someone stated in one of my questions that there is no proof of evolution. That Darwin's theory couldn't be scientifically proven. Which is bull. Over 99% of our DNA being similar to a chimp's is proof enough for me that some imaginary all seeing creature didn't create the universe or living things for that matter.

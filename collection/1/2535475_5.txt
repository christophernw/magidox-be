I knew a couple for years who had nothing insured apart from their car, they just didn't believe in it. Many people think insurance is a ripoff. . . Over the years they saved many hundreds in premiums. . . You don't know how good or bad an insurance policy is, until you have to make a claim,. It's a lottery. . . It depends on your personality. I am a pessimist and I have LOTS of insurance.

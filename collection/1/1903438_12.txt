Everyone has their own reason, for some it's their children, their significant other, their 64 impala, whatever, but I think ultimately it's happiness.  You are on a life long search for happiness, once you find happiness you will know, but you have to find it.... It won't find you,  It's a journey that may take your whole life time, some will never find it... You must look though and open your heart every chance you get.  Usually with happiness comes many hard times along the way, but you will love to live for those speedbumps on the road to happiness.  The reason for living may be right in front of you.  It may be across the world but you will find it and answer this question for yourself one day.

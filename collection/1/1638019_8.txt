America is in a fight right now.. Bush thinks our freedom is at stake.. . People who question:. Maybe some of them voted to authorize the war.. Maybe they make their attacks at a bad point in a war to win an election.. Maybe not all those questioning have a alternative plan.. . The enemy watches and commits the next BIGGER atrocity to get on TV.. . See a connection.. . That's just how it is.. . Lets keep the questions constructive and our freedoms intact.. . Free speech but lets be Smart. . What do you want for America?

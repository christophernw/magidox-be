No really. Fanatics come in all areas. Once a fanatic, always a fanatic. Did you ever see the fanatical drunk who reforms and suddenly is fanatical about everyone else being sober? The fanaticism itself has nothing to do with the belief system, but with the personality. The belief system is just how the fanatic manifests his or her personality. Atheism, non-Atheism, drinker, non-drinker, vegetarian, meat-eater, doesn't matter, those are just external manifestations of the inner person.

Sucks- Q. every decision I make. Want more than I have. Never satisfied. Too many ideas not enough follow through. Love handles suck. I don't excercise enough. Feel guilty staying up late on Yahoo even though I have the day off. My dog wants more attention than I give. Still love my X. Didn't fold all my clothes today. Don't call my brother enough. Dont see my sisters enough. Dont see my nephew enough. Dont see my neices enough. Date too many girls. My car is dirty. It's not sunny enough in the state where I live. Dont have the balls to up and move somewhere else. I think my eye Rx is expired. Missed the toilet w/ P today. Cant decide when to euthenize my old dog. Waste time on yahoo.....  Otherwise Its not bad!

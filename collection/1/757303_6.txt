if you feel it is a hot headache, rub a drop or two of neat lavender oil around your hairline and temples.  if the headache seems more connected to a feeling of cold and constriction, a simple paste of ginger powder and hot water can be applied to the forehead and temples, and the sinuses as well if your skin is not too sensitive, and kept on for 10 minutes or so.  i find this works really well.  let me know if it works for you.

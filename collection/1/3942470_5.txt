The reason we have so much racism is that we’ve given up individuality for identity politics.  At the same time we’ve totallly abandoned reason for irrational belief systems.  So we not longer have a nation of individuals, we have clusters of people who’s only identity is their ethnic group or religious affiliation or sexual orientation.  So how do people from different groups communicate or resolve conflict?  They have given up reason so rational persuasion is impossible.  The only thing left is force.  Racism is the flip-side and natural result of nation of people who’s only identity is (insert ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation)-pride.

While I know there are those who wouldn't agree, a Seventh-day Adventist is a Christian who takes the Bible as his/her sole authority. Some of their distinct beliefs are:. 1. In the 7th day of the week (Saturday) as the Biblical Sabbath. 2. In a hell as an event, not an eternal punishment. 3. In death as a sleep and totally unconscious, NOT an immediate reward of either heaven or hell. 4. In the soon return of Jesus to redeem the faithful and destroy the earth, then recreate the earth in its original perfect form.. . For more beliefs and info check out the following:. www.adventist.org -The official site. www.bibleinfo.com -A SDA site answering Bible questions. . Also, there are cults that have sprung off of the Adventist church, so don't get them confused. Seventh-day Advenists are actually normal, descent citizens.

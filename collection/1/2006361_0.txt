It's a kind of marijuana that's more potent because it doesn't have seeds. It was first grown in south america ( SINSEMILLA -not sensamia-means "without seeds" or "seedless in spanish") and sinsemilla/hydroponic pot (hydro's are cultivated in water) is the strongest weed plant of all, and is very expensive.

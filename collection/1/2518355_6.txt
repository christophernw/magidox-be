Easy, go to a bar and order a $5 drink.  If you don't like it, you're not wasting much money.  Vodka is always best with a fruit juice, not a soda and not water or straight.  Try a good vodka such as Grey Goose (you pay for what you get when it comes to vodka) with grapefruit juice or cranberry juice or orange juice.

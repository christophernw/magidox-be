if God didn't want us to eat animals, how come He made 'em outta meat?;-). . but seriously.  have you ever seen a lion on a strictly vegetarian diet?  they won't live long in the wild.  have you ever tried to put on muscle using only a vegetarian diet, and no supplements?  it will not happen.  meat provides essential nutrients and nutrient combinations that no food that doesn't come from animals can provide.  sure, humans can live just fine without meat, but doing so removes a large portion of what they were designed to be able to do.  . .

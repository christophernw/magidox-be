This car would make an unwise choice, as it lacks what is now considered essentials safety kit.. . At the very least, I would expect airbag(s), side impact bars in the doors, anti-lock brakes (to help avoid crash in the first place).. . If you must have a small Vauxhall, get the newest, best specified Corsa you can afford.

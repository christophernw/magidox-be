It depends entirely upon what the charges were, and your behavior since they were recorded. In the long run, you are better off putting it on there, because anyone with a valid court order (such as the military conducting a background check) will pull your criminal record, and if they find it and you didn't own it on your background check application, that actually looks worse than the fact that you have had charges filed against you as a juvenile (or adult for that matter).

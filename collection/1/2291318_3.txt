A black hole is so massive that its powerful gravitational attraction will attract light and let none escape therefore we see nothing but a black (lightless) hole where it is located.  On earth if you throw a tennis ball into the air it will return to earth due to gravity.  On(?) a black hole you could toss a photon (light) into the air(?) and it would return to you because of the powerful gravity.  However the powerful tidal forces of a black hole would tear you apart and you could never perform the experiment yourself (although we could never know for sure because we could never see you).. . On the other hand a white hole(?) would emit light; for example a star, to provide your symmetry.

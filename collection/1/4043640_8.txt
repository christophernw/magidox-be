Make sure you write and phone often,I'm sure your friend will miss you too and I bet he will be glad to stay in touch.I take it from your question that you are gay,your friend knows this and still chose to be your friend,even tho' he isn't,so a few miles should not make any difference to your friendship.Tell him how you feel and try to stay positive.

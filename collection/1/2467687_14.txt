To understand why Atheists get so upset and argumentative with religious people, you have to understand that Atheist are constantly being assaulted by religious people. Therefore, the Atheist goes into attack mode every time a religious nut makes a comment. . . Go to this website: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_pink_unicorn. This website is how an Atheist sees religion. I would compare it to an adult arguing with a kid that Santa Claus is real. The child knows that Santa is real, and would never question it. He has proof, the presents underneath the tree, and Mommy and Daddy say he’s real. Why would he question it? Now imagine that kid gets together with millions of kids and starts demanding that there be a Santa memorial in town square, or that it be put in the constitution that all kids must be good because that’s what Santa said. What if those kids also started a pseudo-science center with the main goal of discrediting the laws of physics because they say that Santa could not do what he does, which means the laws must be wrong? I know this is far fetched, but to an Atheist, this how they see a Christian. A little kid crying about Santa.

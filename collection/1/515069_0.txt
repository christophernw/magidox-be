Baby back ribs is a play on words.  Baby meaning that the ribs are a smaller size and of course back is because of the position of where the ribs come from.  When I was stationed in Germany I found out that Europeans don't eat ribs, they find it barbaric.  Which was great for us Americans because their butchers would sell us a whole bag of ribs really cheap or even free.

I think it's because they don't feel the need to learn another language, they take for granted, that english is "the universal language" so why should they bother to learn another one. Also, americans have a tendancy to think (a little like us in Canada) that people have to live their way (not the way around): it's pretty rare to see an American arriving in another country and try to learn basics phrases to show they appreciate the hospitality of the country they're in.

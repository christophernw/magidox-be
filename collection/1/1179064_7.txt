Often aches and pains, especially in the legs are caused by vitamin deficiency. This is especially true if you have cramps in them. Try eating some bananas, they are loaded with potassium. If you don't like bananas just look for some potassium pills at the store. You should also try massaging them (your legs not the bananas,lol), stretching before bed, and warm baths to help relax the muscles. Once you get them to stop you should try to eat healthier or at least take a multivitamin.

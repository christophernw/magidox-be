Because our galaxy has a rotating, supermassive black hole at its center.  As it rotates, the gravitational pull drags all the matter that surrounds it with it, creating the spiral.  I believe this process is the best representation of 'frame dragging' as discussed in some of Einstein's theories.. . You might consider the galaxy as one huge accretion disk spiralling around the central black hole.

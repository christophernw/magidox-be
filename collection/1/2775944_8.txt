The most typical cause of vertigo is a issue with the inner ear.  See a GP or neurologist to help determine the cause of the vertigo, some can be cured but some can't.  I have vertigo caused by fluid in my inner ear so I take an antihistamine to 'dry things up'.  When the vertigo is bad I take dramamine or wear 'Sea Bands'. Also, change positions very slowly....like when getting out of bed.  Hope this helps.

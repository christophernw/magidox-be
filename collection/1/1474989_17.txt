I am very sorry for your loss and I have been there before so I do understand what you are going through. It is a part of the grieving process to run the gamit of emotions, denial, hurt, sadness, anger and you just have to let yourself feel the feelings but know that it is no shame to seek help from this and if you do feel this anger towards God, there is lots of help available from professional grief counsellors available out there to help you work through all your anger, fears, etc.  I wish you the best in your journey and hope you make it to the other side where the joy and gratitude can fill your heart.  I mean joy from having this special person in your life and gratitude for the many things good that this person brought into your life even in her very short time.  It is perfectly okay to be mad at God and to question God so don't take on any guilt if you are, regardless of what others say.  I know this sounds very contrite under the circumstances, but I really believe if God leads you to it...He will lead you through it!

You can do cardio every day. It's great for you. . . However things like weight training or anything hard should not be done every day. When you do weights, it breaks down your muscles. Then your muscles grow back bigger and healthier. That's the whole point, to build them up. That's why you need a break in between muscle training/weights workouts. Of course you can do it every day if you alternate different muscle groups. Allowing rest for some while working others.

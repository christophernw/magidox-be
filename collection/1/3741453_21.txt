I think (therefore I am)... my opinion is that Jesus' death and ressurection happened because he continued to stand up for his deep dedication to God, and believing this, will give us the right to be in his presence...and in God's presence because there is no doubt, he was resurrected (Muslims believe this too...as to many other faiths); it's just my belief that the only way for us to be 'saved' (from hell) is to live our lives in a goodly way, and to 'keep our eye upon the sparrow' (God) in our daily lives.  In other words, I think we save ourselves (or not)...based on what Jesus death showed us all.   But, to say that his death & raising 'saved' us...is too trite...and far too easy of "a way out" of all the punishment for sinning against God.  SAVED? .. what are Christians, those who are beyond being punished?  Give me a break!.

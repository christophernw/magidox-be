Many people think they don't need God to explain the origen of the Universe. They think that unless something is proven is not true. If we only believe what we experience then all knowledge should be put into question, there would be no absolutes. How come are we (evolving from apes as we have) be able to question ourselves about the origin of the Universe? We are the living proof that there is a divine spark in each and every single person in this world.. . I think faith and reason are not against each other.

Well.. When you love someone so much.. but the person you love is a man, too.. That means you're a gay... I think usually people became gay because of his social life.. Maybe family, friends, or the other people near him.. But it might happened not from the social life, but well.. it's rather difficult to explain, I think it just happened.. You can't choose which person you'll love right?. . To realise a gay person? I think it's quite difficult.. Maybe if he tries to get your attention.. =) JK.. You can't judge a person gay or not just by look for a while.. You have to know him well.. and from his attitude or what he speak.. it might show..

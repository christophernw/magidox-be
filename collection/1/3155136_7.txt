Please don't apply anything with oils in it!! PB is definitely out! Looked on Internet for home remedy's when my daughter burnt her foot.  Lots of call for Aloe Vera, Mustard and Egg Whites (the most common).  Tried all, the only "home remedy that worked was egg whites." Beat Egg whites into froth. Immerse elbow in egg white for at least 15 to 20 minutes. Let egg white dry on skin and reapply until you have coats dried on your skin.  The coated egg whites keeps the burning sensation down to tolerable levels. My Four year will testify to that!  Not sure if mustard really works, since my daughter didn't like the smell after it was applied...and had to be washed off quickly, plus its more messy. This also worked for me, when I accidentally burned my finger while cooking. Immediately applied egg white.  Don't keep icing, or submerge in cold water, it doesn't relieve the pain, only prolongs it.  If it blisters, don't break it! (you'll open it to infection)

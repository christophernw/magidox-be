Make fun of the guys wearing Abercrombie & Fitch $50 polo shirts, then walk to the other end of the mall, buy a $50 'I am not a consumer whore' t-shirt from Hot Topic, then parade around the mall -- a bastion of capitalism and conformity -- wearing your new shirt and talking loudly about how you're stickin' it to the 'establishment'.  Follow up with high-priced fasion accessories, and makeup to further confirm with the 'non-conformists'.

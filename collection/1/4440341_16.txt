DON'T DO IT! I'm not saying your friend is untrustworthy but that's a huge responsibility to take on. By you co- signing for him you're saying that you will pick up the tab if he doesn't. You wont be driving the car, you're not married nor even relalted! Also if he needs a co- signer that means he either has no credit or bad credit which means he has had a history of not paying up to businesses, if he's not gong to pay to them what makes you think he's not gonna screw you? You def shouldn't do it, save your good credit for yourself and family in the future, you earned it, he didn't. And he knows that. He's probably just trying to take advantage of you. I think that it is so rude of your friend to even put you into a situation like this.

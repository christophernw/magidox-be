The best way is when he bites, to let him know that this behavior is not acceptable. Tell him "No, no, no!" in a firm, but still friendly tone, and put him in his cage for a 10 minute time out. This will let him know that this particular behavior will not be tolerated and he should (in time!) stop biting.. . Just remember to BE PATIENT! If he's around 6 months old to a year, this is adolescence and he is testing his boundaries! Just don't give up ... your sweet little baby is still under those feathers and that sharp beak ... he's just hormonal.. . And contrary to someone else's advice, you should NEVER tap a bird on his beak! That is a living organ, just like a finger or toe, and is full of nerve endings. You could really hurt your bird that way. Kisses on beaks are great ... but not punishments.

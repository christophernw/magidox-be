Of course -  full auto rifles equipped with EOTech sights and night vision. That way, more people could be equipped (versus small amounts of larger items). They had night vision way back when, but the scopes were so huge, their maneuverability was an issue. I'm a gun enthusiast and My AR15 has both, they are great gadgets, and we have talked endlessly about what an asset they would have been back in the day.

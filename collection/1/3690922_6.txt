YIKES!!   Thats pretty hard core, just have to wait it out or move. Do other things, not ho like, and people will start noticing that and eventually it will go away. I'm sorry to say that they might always be around and some people just like to joke people, if it makes you feel any better,   I would think these have to be some pretty lame guys who would do that anyway. Who got the sloppy seconds and thirds?. Basically they just screwed their guy friend in my opinnion.. Gross

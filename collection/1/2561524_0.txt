sometimes i wonder if you even need a pulse to get a driver's liscence... you have to be a complete moron to cut infront of an 18-wheeler, slam on the brakes and then wonder why your car is a greasy spot in the freeway. there is an applicable saying: build a better idiot-proof <something>, god builds a better idiot. i have a question for you folk: are people who drive stick more alert to their driving, and thusly hit less things, than those who drive automatics?

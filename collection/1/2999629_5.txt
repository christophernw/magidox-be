I have tried this experiment several times, and have come up with the following best three ways;. . 1) Wrap it in lots and lots and lots of paper. Toilet paper is the best. When the egg starts looking like the size of a basketball, go ahead and drop it.. . 2) place the egg in the middle of a contraption that is designed to take the damage rather than the egg.  An example is to make a soccerball-type patterned ball out of drinking straws, and also place the egg in the middle  of the ball by making a cradle out of the drinking straws as well.. . 3) Make a huge windmill-type thing - where the windmill, as it turns, arrests the accelleration of the descent of the egg.. . Good luck, and let us know how you go!!

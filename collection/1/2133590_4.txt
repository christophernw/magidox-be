If you cause water to evaporate (typically by boiling it), the salt(s) which is(are) dissolved in the water cannot evaporate (well, below some pretty high temperatures...) and will precipitate as a solid residue, while the evaporated (boiled) water will be pure, and, if condensed and collected, you get some nice pure water

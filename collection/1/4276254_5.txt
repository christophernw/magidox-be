A mountain is a landform that extends above the surrounding terrain in a limited area. A mountain is generally higher and steeper than a hill, but there is considerable overlap, and usage often depends on local custom. . . . In England and Wales the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has defined "mountain" (as a mass noun) as all land over 600 metres, for the purposes of right to roam legislation. This is a close metric equivalent of 2,000 feet (609.6 m). The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 does not appear to draw this distinction, and in Scotland the term "mountain" is more subjective, often being used for hills exceeding 3,000 feet (914.4 m) listed as Munros, as well as many lower hills which are distinctive or mountainous.. . So using the Dept. of Rural Affairs definition, at 600 metres   Craig y Llyn in Wales. . . As to the lowest hill, I have one, which is listed on the Ordanance Survey Map, which is not more than a 1000 metres from where I live, Hubbard Hill at the stunning height of 5 metres, Grid Ref. TF 417 623, often used by the Lincolnshire Mountain Rescue Team for practising difficult rescues at low altitude!. . Highest hill - The Cheviot is the highest hill in the Cheviots range at 2,674 ft (815 m).

First of all infant baptism is witchcraft a lie it is not scriptural but diabolical.  The bible says in Mark 16:16 "He that beliveth and is baptized shall be saved: but he that believeth not shall be damned."  A baby doesn't believe you can't baptize an infant.  The only way that a baby is saved is if the parents are living holy (sinless) and doing what the bible says.  1st Cor. 7:14 "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by husband: else where your children unclean; but now are they holy."  One or both of the parents must be holy according to the Gospel of Christ.  That means free from sin, holy, perfect (Blameless doing what the bible says) righteous, sanctified, by the word of God.  Jesus said in John 15:3 "Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you."  Being in religion catholic, protestant, JW, Mormon same things all witch craft and deceivers that don't believe what the bible says but believe what philosophers say. . . We are told in the bible to come out from among them and be not partakers of their sin.  2nd Cor 6 14-18.  Those churches will not at all take you to meet the real Jesus in the air but the second death the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone. (Hell).  Get born of God and you will sin not.  Get in the bible today and convert to what is written and you will have no taste for the Romans catholic, or protestant or whatever system man has going.  Revelation 1:3 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand."

If there is hot air coming from one vent and cold from another, I dont see how this can be associated with a Thermostat or coolant levels, since the hot air would be coming from the heater core.  If it was the thermostat being stuck open, then none of the air would get warm.  Sounds more like a diverter, in the ducting of some sort, not opening to the proper position.

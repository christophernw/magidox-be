Since you're asking in the Alternative Health section - I'll give you the answer from an Alternative Health perspective.. . The skin is the least important organ in the body. If you have skin syptoms - leave them alone. They are an outer expression of an internal disturbance. If you 'cut them off' (or get rid of skin symptoms in a suppressive way) the disturbance WILL either reappear OR find another (more dangerous - as in internal organs!) outlet.

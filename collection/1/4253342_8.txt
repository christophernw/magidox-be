Snape is not evil and I believe that he was following Dumbledore's orders when he killed Dumbledore. Didn't Dumbledore say something along the lines of "Severus... Severus... please..."??? I call that an order... because Dumbledore was dying already, and he wanted to save Draco Malfoy from a life in Azkaban. Remember that he had a drink from the lake? I think that that was the drought of the living dead, and that Dumbledore was already starting to die as it was. So no, I do not think that Snape is evil... I just think that he is an annoying kinda slimy git... who I have a luv/hate relationship with...

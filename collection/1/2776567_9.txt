pregnancy is different for everyone, but usually you stop menstrating, had sore or tender breasts, and are really really tired all the time out of the blue, and some times you will be moodier, and nauseous or sick. If you are worried because you ahve some symptoms, take a home pregnancy test...even the ones at the Dollar stores for $1.00 are usually accurate.(its rare to get a false positive...) if you still arent sure, talk to your dr. they can do blood, and urine tests... Good luck either way...

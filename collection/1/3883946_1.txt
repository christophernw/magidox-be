I personally think that humans were not created to just praise him. He already had supernatural beings to do that.  I believe the tree was placed there for obedience. He gave Adam and Eve the choice to obey him. Worship happens in many forms and obiedience is one of them. We as humans were given the power to choose to obey or not to obey.  Adam and Eve were ment to live forever but they chose to dissobey and and thier punishment was not only working in the dust and painful child birth, but death...not right away but death did come to them.

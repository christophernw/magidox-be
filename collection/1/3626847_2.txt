well i dont know how much experience i have but i can tell you about my truck. the engine light is on all the time since i baught the thing and i havent had a problem with it yet i believe its just a computer problem, if you turn your car off and unhook the battery cable at the negative end and wait 30 seconds it should reset but if not it could just be the computer.

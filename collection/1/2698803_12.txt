Easter to me means rebirth and it reminds me of how fortunate i am that my GOD chose to give his only begotten son to die for my sins.Think about that could you give your only son to die a horrifying death?I know that I fall short of the glory of god but i'm so happy that he loves me and never gives up on me.

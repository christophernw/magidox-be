Steroids are substances which regulate your bodies functions.. . So something is either a steroid or not - It does not become a steroid because someone (ie a government) decides it should be called one.. . So if certain uses of Steroids are illegal - then it is possible to use a new substance which is a steroid illegally even if nothing very much is known about it

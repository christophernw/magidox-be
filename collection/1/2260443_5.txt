At root, blasphemy is about hate and envy. . . For example, let's say you know a woman who has a wonderful character, who is kind and loving to others and has a pure heart. When she smiles, her face lights up with spirit. She is warm and people are attracted to her as a result. . . Some people hate to see that spiritual beauty in others. They are themselves filled with inner self-loathing and are envious of others who have an inner spiritual beauty. As a result, such people will try to destroy those they envy. . . An excellent example of this is those who crucified Jesus. They didn't do this because they didn't believe in him; they did it because they knew very well that Jesus was who he claimed to be. And they hated him for it. They envied his divine beauty, which attracted the multitudes. They wanted the limelight and weren't willing to let Jesus have it. So they plotted to have him killed. . . That is blasphemy. It's about hatred and envy of the light that shines in those with an inner spirit. In religious terms, its hatred of the Holy Spirit. It's not about those who are ignorant of the Holy Spirit; it's about those who can see it and oppose it because it threatens them.

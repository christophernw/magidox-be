spray hairsrpay directly on to stain-- make sure to have a towel underneath the satin (in between the material) so that the ink doesn't bleed through to the other side let it sit for 5-10 minutes dab off excess spray... if it doesn't look almost gone spray again and let it sit.. dab off excess and wash-- poof no more ink! :)

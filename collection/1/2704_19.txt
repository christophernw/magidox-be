I asked myself that question a millions of times but I realized if a man wants me because of my looks and not how I feel or of my intellegents then I don't need him at all cause you can find a good man out there who loves you more than your looks and who will appreciate your goodness and love you unconditionally, cause there are girls out there who may look cute but are really ugly on the inside, and then the guy will get his feelings hurt and then he will realize that beauty is only skin deep, but it takes guys with knowledge to find that out!

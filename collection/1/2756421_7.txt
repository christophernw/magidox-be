The existence for Yahoo Answers finds its reason into getting questions answered and not in gathering as many points as you can. Giving points for answers and ratings supports that and brings a competition element into answering questions as well as possible. Rating questions however would not contribute to Yahoo Answer's purpose and maybe even work contraproductive. Yahoo Answers now is for everyone, smart and not so smart, if you are rating the questions, that could be a reason for people not to ask questions because they don't want to be considered not so smart.. So, I don't think it a good idea.

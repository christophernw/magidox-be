south park has a show about chef's balls which are edible and. . saturday night live  had  a skit with one of the baldwins on a cooking show that was pretty racy.. . i have no idea what you are doing wrong...it might be the cheese you are using but as long as they taste good and no one dies of food poisoning- all is well- right?

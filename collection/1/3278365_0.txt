From the Oxford English Dictionary, accessed online through my university: Used as n. allusively of a man whose amorous activities resemble those of the Italian adventurer, Giovanni Jacopo Casanova de Seingalt (1725-98), author of memoirs, in French, describing his escapades and amours in most countries of Europe. So Casanova-ish, Casanovesque, Casanovian adjs.; also Casanovism.

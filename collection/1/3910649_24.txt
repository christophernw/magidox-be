Fake nails is a good idea, like the girl said above. I tried that and it didn't work, but it's the only good idea that I have for you. I don't know how I stopped. I just looked down at my nails one day and realized, "hey, I haven't bitten my nails in months and look at them!" - it was pretty cool. I haven't bitten my nails in 3 years!!! :)

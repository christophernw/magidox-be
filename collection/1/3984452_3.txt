You can claim tax exempt if you are a fulltime student and your parents are not claiming your on their taxes.  If you want more money on your  paycheck now claim a high number of exemptions, ( I claim 7 and they take about $20 for federal taxes and $5.00 for state taxes).  I do this from Jan - June.  Then on July 1st, I do a new W-2 form  and change my exemptions to 1.  I end up still getting a tax refund for earned credit and get more money on my paychecks.

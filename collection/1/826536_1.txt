I just saw a TV special about strokes.  When you begin to get the symptoms, immediately take an aspirin.  Then go to the hospital and get what they call a "TPA" within 3 hours from the onset of the stroke.  The TV special stated that this action will mimimize the effects of a stroke or ensure that you do not get any negative effects.

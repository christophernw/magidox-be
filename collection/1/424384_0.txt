In addition to the above answer, when you can get credit, there are two types, installment and revolving. Revolving is like a credit card for a store, or a VISA, one where the balance can go up or down. And installment credit is like a mortgage or a car, where typically, the balance will not increase, unless modified, and the payments will stay constant. Both are an important part of building your credit.

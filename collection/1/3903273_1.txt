I'd get on well with Eve if she is still open to temptation.  From what I hear, she might be quite a babe.. . But there is no chance I will go to "paradise"... (a fact for which I am truely thankful).  After I die, I'm gonna come back to earth and do it all again, have more fun than I did this time, and start even sooner!

it just depends on how strong the perfume is. if its a body SLASH, then u can spray it all over. if its super strong, spray in the air and walk into it. if its not strong but not super weak either, spritz ur neck and wrist or just one or the other. just bc u cant smell it doesnt mean others cant. i usually always use 2squirts on the neck and wrist. hope i helpd!

First of all unless you are sure you have the proper equipment I wouldn't mess with phosphoric acid.  The phosphoric acid and the zinc oxide could be enough depending on what type of metal you are trying to clean.  If the metal you are trying to clean has a higher reduction potential than zinc then your good otherwise you will need a catalyst.

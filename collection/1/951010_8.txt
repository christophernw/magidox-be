There are plenty od oil refineries that are not being used. There is one at Port Manatee in Bradenton FL. It was never put into operation. Sunray DX has one closed in Duncan , OK.. There is plenty of crude for more refineries. Gas prices would go down if supply was increased..What part of profit don't you understand?

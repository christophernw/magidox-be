Unlike us, dogs have a very powerful and keen sense of smell which allows them to gather information which we fail to catch from smell and the like.. . More than just urine, dogs can mark their territories with secretions that are mixed in their urine, as well as mark places where they leave their "mark" to drop their mess, so to speak.. . Dogs love to sniff to check if another is in heat too.  And frankly, I think dogs find humans interesting and love to smell them to try to make sense of us.

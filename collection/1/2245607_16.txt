Scrubbing the wall w/ one of the specialty products to defumigate the area is a good start. But no need to spray repellent which can mix with what is allready up there and make it smell even worse. (happened to me once) just put a small bowl of your cat's dry food in front of it. Cats don't spray where they eat! It doesn't have to be there primary bowl either. As to why he is doing it, there are many reasons, from territory to boredom. If the cat is not fixed, it will help, but not all cats stop spraying afterwards. If you keep your cat busy it would keep boredom away also. But you know your cat, and should be able to figure out why. Once you do the battle is half over, just fix the main problem.

America was named before Mexico and Canada were declared separate countries within what came to be called North America. Hence, the U.S. is officially the United States OF AMERICA. Just using "America" is shorter. America isn't the whole continent. NORTH America is the continent, as opposed to South America. . . Blame Columbus for thinking he'd found the West Indies. That's why Native Americans have been called Indians, after all.

Some people think England is great, some people think it isn't so great, it's all a matter of opinion.. . Personally, I think England is great - even though people slag off my country, I think the goverment is good as we get free education, our education system is one of the best in the world - why do so many people some here and pay thousands to study?. . Of course, there's a lot of things that could be improved too but doesn't most countries?. . come on England!

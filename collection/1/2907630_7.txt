The sun is not yellow. It looks yellow to us because we see it through the atmosphere, which absorbs the longer frequencies of light and scatters blue and nearby frequencies. If you see pictures of the sun taken from above the atmosphere, it is brilliant white.. . The moon is mostly gray and a good reflector (has a high "albedo" as they say in astronomy), so it reflects white light. Depending on where the moon is around the earth, you can also see earth's light reflection lighting up the moon, though not nearly as brightly as the sun. Most of the reflected sunlight is from clouds and ice/snow, so it is also white.

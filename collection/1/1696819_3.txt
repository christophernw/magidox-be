As near as I can find, only America and England the people do not eat horse flesh.  It is mainly because of 'our' closeness to horses.  They are pets like dogs and cats.  In Europe, especially France and Germany, horse meat is popular whereas in certain Asian countries, dogs and cats are eaten.  Horse meat tastes like a cross between beef and venison.  It is high in protein and has little fat.  The meat is stringy and needs to be prepared carefully.

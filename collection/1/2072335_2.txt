Only stupid people think that.... a terrorist is someone who spreads terror for no reason, or for not a justifiable reason (like the Oklahoma bomber, or priests who molest little children or televangelist who rip the money from people making them believe they'll go to heaven)... like for example Bush going to Iraq to steal the oil, if that's a good reason for u, then u're stupid... if not, then Bush is a terrorist but too powerful so no media can call him that explicitly. . On the other hand, the Muslims who do what they do (I'm against violence anyway), they do it because they believe that America is the reason for suffering in the Middle East, and Arab leaders are nothing but employees for the White House, so some Muslims decided to take matters in their hands and fight back.. . The bottom line is, when terrorism is executed officialy (like America in Iraq), people like u tend not to call it terrorism... but when it's a fight back, then u call it that.

I am a Seventh Day Adventist, and our denomination is big on health (as the body is a temple of Christ).  There are many, many health benefits of this sort of diet, and it really exercises self-control, a necessity for the Christian lifestyle.  Some believe that God intended for humans to not eat meat, and just want to go with His plan.  However, not all Christians are vegetarians.  An all-natural diet and means of healing really do cleanse the temple of your body, and it's got to be clean if you expect Christ to want to live in it.

In babylon the people tried to build a tower to heaven, they thought thats how you could get there,  They did this day and night. God created everyone to speak in different tongues, so they would know that that is not the way to heaven. They finally had to stop because they couldn't understand each other, can you imagine what this may of looked like? At first people all thought they were drunk with wine.

It's when someone or something shows or tells you things that you don't know you are hearing or seeing until you are brain washed by them. Like on an episode of the Simpsons when bart joined a boy band and he was singing a song that was actually Join The Navy backwards. So all of these kids are seeing this music video and for some reason they feel like Joining the Navy.

i'm not a girl but everyone around me is and i kno they suck.  but they have that medication Seasonale which makes u only have 4 periods a year.  that's the best ur gonna get so take it or leave it.  lol.  i'm not sure if that's a birth control pill...ne way.  check with a doctor.  u probably can't get it if ur like 12...but yea,  talk to a doctor...

Here is part of the Word of Wisdom (our "intake" guide I guess). .  1 A Word OF Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, assembled in Kirtland, and the church, and also the saints in Zion— .   2 To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days— .   3 Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints. .   4 Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation— .   5 That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only in assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him. .   6 And, behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of the vine, of your own make. .   7 And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of your bodies. .   8 And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill. .   9 And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly. . . We believe in modern and continued revelation, this is found in the Doctrine & Covenants.

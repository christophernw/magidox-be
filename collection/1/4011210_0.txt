Monica confided in the wrong woman.... I've forgotten the gal's name, but instead of the friend she claimed to be, she turned out to be a spiteful, nasty l'il harpy who used the confidence to garner her 15 minutes in the spotlight.. I always thought Bill's extracurricular activities were Hillary's problem, not mine and I remain annoyed that so many taxpayer dollars were expended on a silly little pocket scandal.

Maybe because they know they are wrong,  so its all they have.   I pray someday we get someone in the WhiteHouse that will kick all the illegals back to Mexico.   Bush is putting the Guard down on the border, and that should help stem the flow,  but he wants to offer amnesty to the 30 million or so here illegally already.    The House will block it though,  and maybe a real bill will be announced.  One that will not include amnesty or allow anyone that came here illegally a free pass.    Make them all go home and come back legally,  no matter how long they've lived here.  Doesnt matter if they have children born here either.   Illegal is illegal,  period.  . . Go home Paco!!!

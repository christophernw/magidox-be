Snape didn't killed Harry before he escapes because possibly that he just wants Voldemort to personally kill Harry. He did protect Harry for the past 5 years in Hogwarts so that he would gain trust from Professor Dumbledore that Snape was not a Death Eater. Until in book 6, Half-Blood Prince, Snape and Dumbledore had a small argument...and Snape just made the Unbreakable Vow to protect Draco Malfoy from anything by his mother. Furthermore, Snape let Wormtail to live in his own house! Possibility that Voldemort asked Snape to take care of Wormtail....we just wait till book 7 comes out and see whether Snape is evil...

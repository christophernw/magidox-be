There is a large movement against the current Israeli modus operandi against the Palestinians.  However, it seems as though you are rather ill-informed about the current conflict and world views which support and condemn Israel and the Palestinian territories.  Contrary to popular belief:  Palestine is not an independently-recognized country, as it does not have full sovereignty, nor does it control itself.  The Palestinian Authority is only permitted to have its own police.  It is not permitted to, nor does it posses its own military.  It is controlled and regulated by Israel.

This is a rhetorical question right?. . Apparently it has been a little while since any of these fine people have listened to Kings speech when he asked that all people be judged based on the merits of their character rather than the color of their skin.. . The same reason OJ was not guilty, the same reason Marion Barry was re-elected. The same reason Sandra McKinney would probably get elected if she ever ran for Governor of Georgia. The same reason Alcee Hastings was elected to be a US represetative after being impeached as a judge.. . Despite all their claims of racism, Blacks apparently, would rather free an obviously guilty black man than convict someone who was black who butchered 2 white people. . . They would rather have a black crack addict than any white as mayor.  . . Blacks would rather have a black representative who assaults a white cop at the white house than a white representative period.. . Blacks would rather elect a black representative who, as a judge, was impeached for perjury and corruption and was only the 6th Judge ever removed from the bench than ever trusting "whitee" cause they're just not honest.. . With that clearly racist history, why would you even think they would want a white mayor when they can have a black one whose full extent of aid to them during Katrina was turning down federal help until it was too late and unlocking the front doors to the super dome.  . . Whew - that must have been at least 2 full minutes of back breaking, grueling work.  And to think he did it all single handedly!!!!. . The wondeful thing is - they got exactly what they deserved.

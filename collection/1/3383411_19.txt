Hey, white people are fat too honey, probably more obese then the minorities.  However, if what you are saying was true it would probably be because minorities are often paid less and end up buying less nutritious foods becasue they are often less expensive.  And they are so busy working that at their underpaid jobs that they don't have as much time or energy to work out. And people of minorities are often less educated because of lack of funds then whites.  But thats one of the things that people haven't learned from history.

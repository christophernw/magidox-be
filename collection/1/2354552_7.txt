i think it's the same reason y soda cans get wet when u put them on the counter fresh from the fridge.  but, i do not know the reason except that it has sumthin 2 do with difference in temp.  i also know that i like coke.  and 7up.  and lemonade, but that's not soda.  i don't like root beer.  now i remember! it's called condensation.  it's when the air like does the opposite of evaporate or something.  oh yeah!  it goes from air to liquid when the temp changes!

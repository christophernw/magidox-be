I dont know why people worship the bible, that was written by people through the inspiration of God, then assembled and decided which text go in it and which texts don't, when seeing many other just as holy texts, then think a pope is ridiculus because God can't mediate through people.. . It's not about the worship it's about God's influence through individuals.

I am an Indian too and would definitely like to see India with more Greenery and less of concrete.First and foremost we need to prevent cuttin away of forests for makin roads and buildings.If construction of buildings is essential due to increasing population then we only need to keep plantin more and more trees.In my opinion i feel that the gift of nature i.e hills,lakes,forests should not be destroyed...We should encourage the citizens to keep the rivers and lakes clean instead of contaminating them(specially in rural areas)And wherever possible the Muincipal Corp should palnt trees and shrubs and maintain them....More trees less pollution in the air thus fewer lung infections.. So what i finally have to say is .....trees trees and more trees...and stop wastin water.....water also should be metered just like electricity and charged monthly( like in foreign countries).

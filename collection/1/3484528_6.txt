i disagree with punishing the cat. cuz the cat isnt going to understand what it is being punished for. especially when the cat is doing something that is its nature. you dont want ur cat to start fearing u and lose its trust.. p.s. never spray a cat with water on its face, cuz water should never go in a cat's ears!

First of all tell her not to smoke in her house. My husband smokes and we do not smoke indoors. To really get rid of the smell the best thing and it sounds weird, but go to Wal-mart to the sporting goods section and get the scent killer that hunters use. Make sure you get the right one, some of them add the scent of the forest floor. But it works great!

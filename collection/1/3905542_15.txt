my sister and boyfriend are bipolar i don't know if all bipolar disorders are the same but i can tell u how they act. My lil sister is loud and constantly needs attention sometimes shes very happy and then other (in the same day) shes sad with tears and all. She often makes noises and things just to get people to look at her she doesn't focus in school and has bad grades. My boyfriends type of bipolar disorder is manic depression. He is always unhappy and rarely feels a reason to smile, its hard to make him happy but i found ways to, he often takes things to extreme, like if i was to say that he was ugly jokingly, he would really think he was ugly and began to ask himself things and say no wonder people don't like me, and just make it his focus of the day, sometimes we used to get into arguments and then he would say he had to call me back just because he needed that time to himself and we wouldn't talk to the Next day. I don't know if this helps any or if this is understandable but i hope it is.

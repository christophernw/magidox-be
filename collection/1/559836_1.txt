Scientists are in denial about alot of healing techiques. They are in denial about herbs curing disease, and alot of them don't believe in God or support any religeous theory. They are so ignorant that they believe the universe created itself! What does that tell you? Its best to stick with what you know works! And not listen to people who don't believe. Myself, I believe there is a God and I believe he can heal! I don't need science to explain that to me! Its my constitutional right to believe what I want. If I know an herb can possibly cure a disease, then I can tell others about it! Its my constitutional right!

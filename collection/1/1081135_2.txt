http://www.medicinenet.com/fluoxetine/article.htm. In this link you'll find all the information you need on Prozac.. . I would recomend going to the doctor before starting to take it again.  You see, there are many kinds of depression, and usually, when you feel "depressed", you are just tense and to overstressed.  Only a doctor can tell you if you are clinically depressed, and medicate you.. . Just go to the doctor, in the long run, you'll save money if you do it now.  Better than finding out that the pills didn't work for you this time.  Don't take unnecessary chances with your mental and physical health.. . Good luck!

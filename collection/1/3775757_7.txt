Sometimes there dosen't need to be a reason to be depressed. There are some illnesses that cause the brain to do this,not you. I know first hand about when you say today's society because I have been diagnosed with depression and there are alot of people out there that don't understand unless they go through it. Don't worry though there are alot of people in this world like me that understand exactly what your going through. If you see that your depression is getting worse you need to talk to your parents and go to see your doctor.

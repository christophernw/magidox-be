You can check to see if any Motorcycle shops or your state has any motorycle safety courses.  Some shops provide bikes for you to use and learn to ride on during the course, not sure on the state.  The state that I live in you have to own your own bike to take the course.  Call around to your neiborhood motorcycle shops and see if they have courses.

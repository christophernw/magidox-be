When the light from the sun hits the earth some of the light (The higher frequency or blue light) gets trapped or rather scattered by the smaller molecules in the atmosphere.  This scattering makes the sky blue because these particles reflect this blue light.. At night the light we are seeing is  the light of  the sun reflected off of the moon and it is much less intense.

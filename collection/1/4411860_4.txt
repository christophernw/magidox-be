The gospel of Judas was written about 180 A.D. However it was written by a group of heretics call Gnostics who believed that Jesus was only a man and not God. . . The Catholic Church of both that time and now do not believe it is true or inspired by God like the real Gospels are.. . For other non-canonical (not accepted as inspired by God) gospels see: http://aggreen.net/bible/noncanon.html

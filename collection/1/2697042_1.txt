maybe your wife uses some kind of product on her hair which is in all the hair tools - like a hairspray or a leave in conditioner and the cat hates the smell - cats hate lemons anything citrus smelling - they jump miles from it!! they may have aversions to other smelss too - you know how you can taste hairspray as well as smell it when its sprayed - maybe thats what it is - I may be wrong - it was just a thought!!!!

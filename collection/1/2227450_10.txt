Well, for one thing, if you're going to convert to a new religion, you should probably go the whole way--there's a difference between a way of life and a religion, and Hinduism is definitely a religion in every sense of the word.. . Now, as to the guilt, it's simple.  If you are doing the right thing for yourself, you don't feel guilt.  I certainly didn't.  I was raised a Christian and converted to Wicca, something that's almost completely opposite, but to me Wicca is the religion that fits perfectly.  If you do not have that some comfortable feeling, the knowing that you're right in this matter and that what you were taught was just that--teaching, not belief--then you will not truly convert and will probably return to your former religion eventually.  Sorry, but if you believe in Jesus etc (and I thought it was God you were supposed to believe in, not Jesus, but oh, well, I haven't been a Christian in almost ten years so goodness knows it could have changed), you aren't going to be anything but Christian.

Are you sure it's a female??  Males do mark their territory by dribbling urine when they walk.   Sounds like this rat is marking.. . A scared rat of either gender may release his/her bladder.   This is just a case of only buying socialized animals & handling them often to where they're not terrified when outside the cage.. . Don't rub her nose in it. This will just confuse/scare the rat... she's not a dog.

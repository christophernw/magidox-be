My grandmother came from Louisiana so I grew up eating hominy which is kind of like a large corn kernel, and grits, which is made from hominy, We used to call them "hominy grits', but I guess now everyone says just "grits". For me they are a comfort food or a nostalgia food. I had them so often as a child, I sometimes crave them even though I actually prefer their cousin, cream of wheat. Sometimes grits are dull and flavorless. Then I give them a "3". But there really are ways to make good tasting grits. You can put cheese on them and bake them. You can cook them with milk and butter and honey. You can saute them with finely chopped onions and peppers and add tomatoes or salsa and cheese. You can even make a killer pancake out of them by adding butter, flour, salt, and honey or sugar and an egg and make a patty, dip it in flour and pan fry in butter until golden brown and then pat dry on a paper towel and serve. Here you can give a big 10.

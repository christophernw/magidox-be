>>>Why do christians say god loves everyone but then turn around and protest against them.<<<. . I would say that any "protesting" done by Christians is done against particular ACTIONS -- not personally against the people who engage in them.. . Take "The DaVinci Code," for example.  Both the book and the film seek to cash in on bending certain truths about Christ and Christianity.  . . Naturally, many Christians are upset over this to the point of protesting it.  But that doesn't mean we wish any harm to come upon Dan Brown, Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, or the folks at Sony Pictures.  . . >>Why do they hate other religions for believeing in the same god?<<<. . We don't "hate" other religions.  I certainly don't, anyway.  I believe that religions other than my own contain at least some elements of religious truth -- at least to the extent that they mirror my religion, Roman Catholicism.. . >>>Why do they bag on other people religions when it dosent coincide with there own<<<. . I wouldn't say it's a case of "bagging" on other religions, which I agree with you is wrong.. . However, if there are elements of another religion that we feel is erroneous, we are well within our rights to say it.  . . People do that to Christianity all the time, and while I definitely don't agree with what they say, they do have a right to say it.

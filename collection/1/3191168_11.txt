i llove god i really do .but i'm after shitless of the thought of dieing i've lived 17 years and seens my fair share of poeple die i it is not a process i wish to go through exspecially seeing how my family must have some sort of disease. such as cancer in varies parts of the body, diabetets, and othe medical terms for whatever else is in my family that i can't spell or prononce. . . i'm afraid of dead people, and funerals although i know i'm going to jion them and end up in one. unless other wise exempted from death, by pure fate that god comes back first.. . the only time i would not be afraid of death is if i died and did not know it or someone else death never registers in my brain.

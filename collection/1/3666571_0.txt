Red-eye occurs when light coming into the eye reflects off the retina, the back surface inside the eyeball.  The rods and cones which give us vision are there with a large supply of blood vessels.  The color of the blood gives the reflected light its red color.  The eye of a cat is particularily good at causing red-eye since their pupils are usually wide open in room light.

Let's say you are getting two checks, one for $500 and one for $350. You want to pay 15% of each toward your $1800 credit card balance.. . You whip out your trusty calculator and start pushing buttons.. . First, you push "500 * .15 =" and get 75.. . Push "MS" and you will store 75 into the calclator's memory.  MS stands for Memory Store.  If there is no "MS" button, the "M+" will accomplish the same thing when the memory is empty.. . A little "M" will usually appear on the display so you know that the memory is being used.. . Then push "350 * .15 =" for a result of 52.5.. . Again push "M+", which will add 52.5 to the 75 in memory and you will have 127.5 stored in memory.. . Now push "1800 - MR =".  MR stands for Memory Recall, and it pulls the 127.5 from the memory.  When you press the " = " button, it will do the same as if you had done "1800 - 127.5 =". . The result will pop up and you now know that you will have a credit card balance of 1672.50 after paying 15% of your two checks.. . Now press "MC" (Memory Clear) or "AC" (All Clear) to make sure you don't forget about your stored number later, when you're doing your taxes.

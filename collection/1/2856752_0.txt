Your parents loved the movie, To Catch a Thief, and named her after Grace Kelly.  However, they thought that the name Carey was no longer in style for boys, but their other favorite movie was White Christmas so they named you after Danny Kaye, not wanting to name you Bing for the same reason they didn't want to name you Carey.

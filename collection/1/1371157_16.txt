You are so angry...I was nearly killed by a drunk who ran over me with his car. I did not ask for revenge. But I did call on His name and He came and protected me from serious injury. Not one broken bone or cut on my body. My sweater didn't look to good, but that was the most damaged thing on my body. God saw what was done and He knew why the man ram over me. I did not ask Him for revenge. But I know the man didn't live a month after hitting me and dragging me under it.  Romans 12:19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but [rather] give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. Is it possible those you are hearing from are not true Christians? Consider the possibility that that may be the case.

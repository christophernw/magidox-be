Because the average US citizen is not very educated on world affairs, geography, global economics, history before Columbus and are not seen to be very cultured (appreciating food, art, music that is beyond McDonald's, pop / rap / rock and Hollywood movies).. . Let's face it -- we know our headlines here, and aside from the war they have very little to do with economics, politics, social issues in other countries (unless you watch CNN and even there there is less and less about the world beyond New York, DC and Los Angeles...). . The world hates that it is this young, uncultured/uneducated/uncaring country that has such power and influence over the fate of the other countries.

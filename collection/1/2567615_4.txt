You can't.My Mother has them, and the Doctor told her that it's a neurological problem in the brain. But I've had to help my Mom so many times that the best advice that I can give you, is when you know that you're about to have one get to a spacious area with lots of oxygen, and count from 20 to 1 while taking deep breaths in between each number..    Good Luck!!.  Hopes this helps you out.

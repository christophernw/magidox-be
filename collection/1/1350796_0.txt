I watched my sister-in-law do a jelly roll at Christmas and the whole thing seemed fairly easy.  After she rolled the cake in a towel to cool, unrolled it, spread the filling and the rolled it again she added a little extra filling (she was using a cream cheese filling) right along the outer edge.  She then wrapped saran wrap around the whole thing and set the roll with the edge side down.  By the time she served it, it had set and there were no problems with the seam coming undone.

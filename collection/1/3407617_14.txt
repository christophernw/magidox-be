You really think you can be happy being a prostitute? Skill, huh? Skills are things that can be enjoyed without getting payed $400 dollars per night by some crack dealers. You can't enjoy prostitution without the money. You wanna know why prostitution is wrong? Because it lowers you from a human being to an object which people use to please themselves. You pay a prostitute to have sex... You're basically having sex with your money. Both you, and the prostitute feel bad and guilty deep inside, but the prostitute is alright because she got payed, and you're good too, cause you got what you wanted - sex. But you just f'ucked your money.. . I don't know who Jesus was in love with or whatever, but being in love with a prostitute and f'ucking a prostitute are two totally different things. And if Jesus was in love with a prostitute, then from that moment on, the prostitute wasn't a prostitute anymore. Technically you can't be in love with a prostitute. You can only f'uck a prostitute. That's why they're called prostitutes - cause they f'uck a lot. If you're in love with a prostitute, "f'ucking" loses its whole meaning, because you don't love the prostitute just so you can f'uck her. Hence, that girl is no longer a prostitute. At least not to you. And in Jesus's case, not to anybody.. Well, good luck.

Are you being serious? You can't possibly be being serious. Well in case you are, I am not sure it's fair to say that Bush is a messenger especially not one sent from God. Also, English is not the language of God. I am not sure what language he spoke, but I'm pretty sure english hasn't been around as long as God has. Not to mention that I don't know if Jesus spoke English. I hope you are joking with this whole thing. However, if you are not, you should probably do a little research and give attention to more than one side of this issue.

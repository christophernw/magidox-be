I don't know about that idea with the wire if you are plannin on someone being able to use these rags-of course if unless it's a thin wire or thread. I say fold it in half, fold it in half again. Use the edge with the two loose edges and the "folded" edge out for the flower petals.. and just bend or fold and stitch in like half-inch, inch increments.  Definetly easier to imagine than to describe. Just keep stitching to the center.

the worst problem in India is the caste system. recently it led to the death of a dalit family in Maharashtra by dominant castes. unless it is abolished by law, it can not be solved. the other way is to abolish reservations on caste basis and to encourage inter caste marriages and making mentioning of caste in public places and naming people suggesting their castes.

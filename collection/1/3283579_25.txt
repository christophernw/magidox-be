Mainstream Christianity (Christian bible) is somewhat worthy, but it's full of Mithraism.. . -- virgin birth (on 25 December). -- god-man. -- savior of the world. -- miracles. -- last supper. -- etc., etc.. . Gnostics had no such things because they had the real teachings of the son of man. Romans snatched the best parts and they also added ISIS (Isis was was "mother of god" and "queen of heaven", etc.) . . So mainstream Christianity is Mithraism (Rome); Gnosticism is real christianity (Alexandria).

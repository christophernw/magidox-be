Acne on the gluteus maximus is common.However,there is relief.Use a loofah sponge when you shower.You can get them at any drug or department store.Use it with or without soap.Gently rub the area that you want to smooth until it has a pinkish color,and after a few uses, you will have a smooth blemish free backside.Good Luck.

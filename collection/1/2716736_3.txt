Electricity and magnetism are related through Maxwell's Equations.. . Basically, passing a wire through a magnetic field induces a current (in one direction) through the wire. . . Alternatively, passing current around a magnetic material will induce a magnetic field, creating a "magnet" with some polarity.. . Electromagnets are simply ferrous materials (materials that contain some form of iron, making them able to hold/direct a magnetic field) inside a coil of wire. Current is passed through the wire, magnetizing the material.. . More amperes (or turns) creates a stronger magnet.. . This is the basis for how all electric machines work.

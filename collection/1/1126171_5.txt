I copied the bit below from http://www.moondragon.org/obgyn/abortion/hysterotomy.html. . Didn't know it existed but why would a woman have this other than it says below. Because other abortion methods have failed.. . There you go.. I learnt something new as well!!! THanks.. . . The hysterotomy is a technique of electively terminating a pregnancy. In this method, a surgical procedure similar to a cesarean section is performed with all the same risks and complications associated with a cesarean delivery. It is reserved for special circumstances, such as when other abortion methods have failed, and usually is not the primary abortion method chosen. The fetus in this photo is being lifted by one foot and the umbilical cord is being clamped and cut. . The fetus is usually killed prior to or at the time of the delivery, usually by cutting the umbilical cord to prevent the fetus from getting oxygen. Occasionally a fetus will survive and may have to be killed after delivery by the health care provider or allowed to die on it's own through neglect. Many countries have laws in place to cover any fetus that is born during an abortion and survives the procedure, but cases have been documented of such babies being left to die. Occasionally when a fetus survives, the mother will choose to keep it or have it adopted out.

My guess is that while Asians and Africans were evolving there wasn't the same ecological diviersity as there was in the areas where the Europeans were evolving.  Thus the Africans and Asians didn't need varied features because they had a like environment. Perhaps Europeans had greater ecological and climate diversity where they evolved requiring differing attributes from each other and more hair for warmth.T hey didn't need the melananin, for example,that the blacks have for protection from the sun as Europe isn't as sunny but they needed beards for warmth. Make sense?

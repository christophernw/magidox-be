Because dislike or hate requires energy and thus some concern or significance for the person.  This is why there is a thin line between love and hate.  Apathy however, means the person isn't worth any energy or concern - they are insignificant.  Being insignificant is the worst fear of most people.  This is played out in the media - the only "bad press is no press."

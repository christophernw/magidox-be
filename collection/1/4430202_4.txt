Thanks for asking... I had to work cuz I could use the overtime.. A friend cooked so I had some dinner at her house. I realize that I have become more of a vegan.. I felt sick the next day after eating mac and cheese she made (by the way it was de-lish!) but I just can't stomach and type of dairy anymore.... . So no more dairy for me...

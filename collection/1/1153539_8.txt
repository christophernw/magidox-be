It's really rare that a person would be in a situation so bad that it makes any sense to run away from it without some idea of what one would run TO.   I recommend making a well thought out plan.  . . First, go to a bookstore, and look through the self-help section and get an aptitude test.  You need to identify with some precision what it is you want to actually do.  It's probable that the answer will surprise you, and you'll find it's something you want to do, but haven't dared or felt possible for you. . . Second, find some people that are doing that, and get their input on how you get there.  They can probably give guidance about training and entry level positions, possibly even know someone. They can help you with your skill assessment for the new career.  You may be more prepared than you think, you just have to look at your experience from the point of view of the new field. . . Third, consider WHERE you want to do it.  You may or may not live where you want to, and may be better off moving to a market more open to entry into the new field. . . Fourth, BELIEVE.  Life is full of people who changed careers after 20 years in a field and were successful and happy. It's possible, but only if you believe in it and commit to it. . . Fifth, pay very close attention to your health.  Changing careers is stressful, and if you're not in shape it can be a source of serious problems.

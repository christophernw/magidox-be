Though the book is fiction it does hold some truth. I believe that there is more to Jesus and DaVinci then the Catholic Church is willing to accapt.Jesus was a rabbi a rabbi was (and maybe still is, I don't know that much) married.. Opus Dei also does practice corporal mortification. If you go to their site they deny it then say they do it. They even mention the cilice.. OPUS DEI IS DISGUSTING AND DOES NEED TO BE STOPPED!

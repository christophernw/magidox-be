Dear,. I only ask you to read all the information that other people kindly presented you.. Please notice at the end it is YOUR body that will tollerate the pain and damages not your husband's.He just want to enjoy now if he really loves you he should care about your health,if not he does not worth it.. In some religions anal sax is forbidden as it is harmful in any condition(monogamy,...). Take care of yourself.

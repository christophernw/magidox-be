The full English breakfast is tricky to prepare, cholesterol on a plate and probably only eaten at weekends or when on holiday.. Most English people grab a cup of tea, some toast and marmalade and run for the bus. If they have time they might indulge in a bowl of cornflakes or bird food - known in England as Muesli. (Genuine Muesli is a completely different thing).. Me? A cup of green tea. Don't eat breakfast, it wakes up my digestive system. If I eat breakfast I'm hungry by mid-day and still want dinner at night.

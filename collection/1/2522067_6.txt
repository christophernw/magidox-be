There are many evil, or what Americans consider evil, leaders in this world.The reality is that unless it happens in our country we have no right to judge other leaders. IF we had destroyed Ahfganistan to kill Osama eveyone in this country would be on the same side. The problem is we invaded a soverign country who had NOTHING to do with 9/11. The hijackers were Saudis, Osama is a Saudi. Did we go into Saudi Arabia. No. Why ?Because Bush has many oil deals with them. We went after Iraqi oil not the real terrorists. Liberals are not incapable of confronting evil, we just want it to be sure that it is the real evil.

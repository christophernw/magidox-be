It is possible to enrich tritium-containing water by sub-boiling-point evaporation - heavier water molecules have a slightly lower "steam pressure" (likelihood to evaporate).. . It is not possible (ok, not feasible - the effort is far greater than de-salting sea water) to remove all tritium from drinking water this way. In case of tritium-rich water supply the easiest way to avoid it is using different water for drinking.

Depends on what you are putting together.. For some things, it's not important if you screw in all sides evenly.  However for other things that require proper alignment for functionality and ease of construction putting the screws in equally is important.  For example, when you put on a tire for a car, you should put the nuts on evenly (opposite nuts in) so that the wheel remains balancedwhen you drive.  But if you are simply puttng one board to another that does not require balance for the object to function (like wallboard) then it really doesn't matter.

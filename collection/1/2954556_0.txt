It's Quite simple and it involves 5 basic units. 1.Coal Mines-First of all coal is required produce the required heat.Coal is extracted from the coal mines using large machines called the bucketwheel excavators.Usually power generating stations are located near coal mines to reduce transporatation costs.. 2.Conveyors and Pulverisors-Conveyor belts are used to transport coal to the power generating stations and there are pulverising mills in the power generating station to crush the coal particles which are not uniform to make it fine.. 3.Boilers-Boiler is the main part in the station because it produces the steam to turbine.Boiler is nothing but a very large container containing water.The coal obtained from pulverising mill is used to heat the boiler.When boiler gets heated up(It will take 4 or 5 hours from cold start)and slowly the water inside will be converted into steam.. 4.Turbine-The Turbine is the very important machine.Turbine has blades inside and they are designed suitably.When the steam obtained from the boiler hits the turbine blades it begins to rotate.(For this the Steam outlet called the nozzle is made small so that the foce of steam will be more).The Turbine is mechanically coupled with the Generator i.e.,the shaft of the Turbine is connected with the shaft of Generator.. 5.Generator-Finally comes the generator which generates 3 phase electrical energy.As I've said the turbine is mechanically coupled with generator.So It's called as Turbo Generator or the Turbo Alternator.In India normal Turbo alternator speed is 3000rpm and they are 2 pole machines so they generate power in the frequency of 50Hz(The formula for frequency is NP/120 where N is speed in rpm and P is number of poles).Coming to its working,this generator converts mechanical to electrical energy.It has two parts the stator and the rotor,the rotor is excited with the Direct Current to produce necessary cutting of the waves produced when it rotates.As the cutting starts Alternating Current will be induced and electrical power will be got at the stator.. This is how electrical energy is produce in a thermal power plant.Contact me if you have any queries regarding this.

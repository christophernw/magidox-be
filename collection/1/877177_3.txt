How long have you had this cat? Just like humans, some people and cats just don't get along. Cats are very picky as to who they love and trust. Not to suggest at all, but if you have any evil tendencies, your cat will know and won't want anything to do with you. They'll attack to protect themselves if they sense harm are...sorry to say....evil. Good Luck...for you...and the cat!

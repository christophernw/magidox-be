People are judgemental because we are limited by the reality that each of us live in. I would like to think that through experience our minds become more open minded. That is why I like and contribute to this website. To open my mind to others opinions, possibly giving me more insight into matters to which I have no firsthand experience. It is not only others answers but their questions that open my mind to new avenues of thought.

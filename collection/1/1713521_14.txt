To whom?  I am a Mormon, so of course I have a testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel and believe mine is the only true church.  I think for people who are looking for the right religion, you need to figure out what is the most important to you...  If it is your family, then LDS is the only one CENTERED on the family unit because we believe families can last through the eternities.  The religion is not a "cult", not scary, weird or anything.  We teach love and devotion to the Savior and to be like him.  I believe it is right because I believe that God loves each one of us, his children, and wants us to be happy and that is what this gospel teaches.

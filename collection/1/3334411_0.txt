I have to admit that my friends and I tried to prove whether that works with beer poured from a pitcher.  It probably does, but I know of no true evidence to say that it does.  How does it work - no one knows that I can tell.  The best guesses are that it's physical disruption of the bubble layer, adding minerals (or other dirt) from your fingers, or oils from your skin.

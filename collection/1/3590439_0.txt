Grace unto you, and peace,. from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.. . The Bible compares the "wicked" and the "just",. but also notes "there is no repsect of persons with God".. So either all wicked by law, or none wicked by His Grace.. . Some, who'd call others wicked, are "more wicked",. or as called in Mt 23 "more the child of hell(law)".. . A wicked and adult-erous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas... yet 40 days till yer ass is grass.. . But the Bible also uses a day for a year analogy.. In which things are an allegory, and a mystery.. Lent is 40 work days from Ash Wednesday.. It's a time to let go of wicked shit.. If it's crap(dung), flush it.. . Bible also speaks of "children of the wicked".. Which is allegory for children of the law.. Bible also notes "children of the kindgom". who notably also get "tossed" to<->fro,. as "children" in understanding tend to.. . Bible talks of seven other spirits more wicked.. Revelation notably has seven spirits mentioned.. . Which things are an allegory.. Allegory for "wicked" is law.. . The "grace" of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.

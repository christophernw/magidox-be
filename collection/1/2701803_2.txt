Any Roman Catholic might have a Blessed cross with someone hanging on it==called a crucifix, a statue of a woman that they say looks like Merium (Mary) the earthly mother of Jesus, pictures of some dead people, like popes, and famous people in the trade that they consider sainted by that cult.   Lots of Jube Jube for otherwise intelligent people!

I think you are right to consider that this may be an illness. It could be physical or emotional. If you have a complete medical checkup with no abnormal results, it might be worth your while to see a counselor and find out if you might be suffering from depression. People with this problem often have very low energy and change their habits in an effort to relieve their tiredness. Good luck.

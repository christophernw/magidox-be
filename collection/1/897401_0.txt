Stop smoking or drinking coffee, and when you brush your teeth, also brush your gums and tongue.  Make sure you eat a balanced diet (not too much meat, which can sit in your stomach, and cause the odor to come up your esophagus and into your mouth.)  Also try "breath assure" which is a caplet you swallow, and it releases freshness into your mouth all day!

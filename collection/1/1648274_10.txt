yes!.  while skipping down the stairs,  from the  Ein-Gedie Spa . heading towards,  the Dead Sea   for a float.. . I tripped and turned my ankle over---OUCH!. .  It did not start to really hurt ,  till i got on the bus back to Jerusalem .... then  it swelled up and the pain was bad . .  ( it took about 10 weeks  to heal.). . ;)

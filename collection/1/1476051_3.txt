If you aren't in school and don't have access to a cadaver lab, I suggest the next best thing-- buying two books: "Color Atlas of Anatomy" by editors Rohen, Yochochi, and Lutjen-Drecoll (excellent photos), and "Atlas of Human Anatomy" by Frank Netter, M.D., probably the best medical illustrator ever. And don't forget to by an actual anatomy textbook.... . A systematic approach, including developmental biology, helps. Have fun.

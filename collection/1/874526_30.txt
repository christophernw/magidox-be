The best way is to try and give a 2 week notice, but I understand that is not always possible. If you do not feel you can give a 2 week notice, then I would just be straight forward with your boss. Let them know that you are turning in your resignation effective immediately and that you are unable to give a 2 week notice. There is nothing that they can do to stop you and I have found that some companies don't want a 2 week notice, if you give one they will ask you to leave right away.. . Hope this helps...

Various denominations exist because of the hardness of human hearts.  The New Testament teaches us that one church is established.  In Corinthians 1:10-17, Paul admonishes those in the church to not start denominations.. . If you notice, each denomination pays more attention to certain parts of the Bible and totally ignore others.  For example, Baptists believe that a true baptism includes full immersion into water but allow couples to remarry even if their ex-spouse remains alive.  Catholics will not allow divorce (in most cases) but do not believe that full immersion is necessary during baptism.  Also, neither of these denominations practice what is considered a full communion as written in the Bible.. . Many of the differences end up being tailored around what the local congregation finds convenient.

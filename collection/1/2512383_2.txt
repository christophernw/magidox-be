Centripetal force is the force which pulls a body or particles towards the axis of its circular path.. Equ: F=m(v^2)/r, r being the radius of its circular path measured from the axis of rotation.. This equation is similar to F=ma, where you can equate a=(v^2)/r. . Please take note that there is NO such force as centrifugal force.. For example, you can feel that you are being pushed outward to the left side of the bus while it is making a right turn. . Reason: you have mass, and before the bus turns, it is moving in a straight line. So do you. When the bus is just making a turn, your body has not turned. According to Newton's first law of motion, your body is reluctant to turn due to inertial.

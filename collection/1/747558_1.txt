Set realistic goals.. I'm not sure if this answer will help you, but I wanted you to know, that I've submitted questions with wrong spelling and grammar, most of us have at one time or another, so do not think that you are the only one.. You need to make a short list of projects, that you really want to accomplish.. Set priorities and at the end of the day look at your list and mark off the things that you got accomplished.. Do activities that you enjoy and that make you feel good about yourself as a person. . You may want to start a hobby or become a volunteer.. Are you interested in learning more about a subject? Find out if you can take a class, to learn more about what you like to do..

Just making a goal of cleaning your bedroom and finishing that goal, that is making good use of your time.. You are going to succeed... because you asked the question..,. And that was the first step to tell the whole world,that you want to do something important with your life and with your time.. Because you are important...and you care about everything around you...

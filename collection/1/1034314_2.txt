Don't worry about it.  God loves people, whoever and wherever they are, and He loves His people to love people too.  Don't do anything that breaks God's seventh commandment, live your own life free as God made you to be from lust, and then you will also be free to care for people who are confused and pained with either inherited or acquired tendencies that are different from the life you have.

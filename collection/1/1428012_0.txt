I was wondering the same thing. I have two Pacus (cousins to the pirhanna) that I've had for about a year. I bought them on sale when they were about as big as my thumb. They are now both about 9" long each. No pet store in the area will take them. Petco won't even sell them in the first place because they get so big so fast. I wish I could find somebody to take them or else I'm going to have to buy a bigger tank.

Place a solid wedge in between the roof and the door/window or the B-pillar and the door/window.. . If that is enough then stop there, if not place an inflatable pouch in the slit you created and inflate it, normally by a hand pump.. . Use a long metal wire, much like a hangar to reach inside and push the manual lock button to unlock. If your good, the wire would have a very rough sticky coating on the end of it for a better grip.. . If the lock is a "pin" style that is on the top of the door sill, generally a slim jim would be inserted downwards, and you would catch the lock pin in the V shaped cut in the end, apply pressure and pull up. Works just like the backside of a hammer.

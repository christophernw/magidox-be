Transform movement doesn't actually displace much water, just sends out shockwaves.  The seabed remains at the same level, more or less, so the water just transmits vibrations but doesn't really go anywhere.. . Megathrusts, however, change the level of the seabed dramatically which displaces a massive amount of water.  This displacement is propagated as a wave which may result in tsunami.

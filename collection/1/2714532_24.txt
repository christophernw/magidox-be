The God of Judah gives people the freewill to choose. He does not force(despite that some Christians try to force) belief on anyone. Also it is the job of Christians to show the love and merci of the God of Judah, which they are not doing so well on a whole. Islam seems to view Alah as powerful and imposing. They say he is a God of merci, but they sure don't practice their religion that way. The God of Judah is a God of freewill.

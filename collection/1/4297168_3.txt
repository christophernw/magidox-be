Fury1162 has the answer, get a similar book from the library, just to check out the style. Then sit down and write your story, just plonk it out on your computer, don't worry if your not very good at typing, keep reading through it , you will pick out most errors yourself.. If you have any  very good friends ask them to read it as you progress, be prepared for a lot of hassle from them, but if you can get them really interested they will be a great help, if you can't get them interested then maybe it's not going to be a good book after all.. But whatever, go for it or you will be wishing all your life that you had.. Don't expect to write a best seller, or dream about movie rights, just do it because you want to!

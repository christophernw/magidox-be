there are "no whites zones" in the US. they just don't need signs. there are just some areas that you just wont see any white people.. racism works both ways but there have been so many centuries of white pople believing they were superior to all other races its pretty much accepted now to give back what they gave. Its a double standrd that you pretty much have to accept. You cant cry foul now that the tables have been turned. Its not fair but it wasn't fair to enslve my ancestors (black people), push the native american off their homeland, lock up japanese for being japanese during WWII, assume all arabs are terrorists, imperialize the entire contient of Africa, enact Jim Crow laws,....I could go on all day

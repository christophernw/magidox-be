to live a contemplative life is to be observant of things around you and of the world, and to ponder the (deeper) meanings of things.  it is not always the happiest life; only for some people.  others would sooner shoot themselves in the foot.  but I think that it gives more meaning to life because what is the point of being here if you're not going to look into things at least to some extent?

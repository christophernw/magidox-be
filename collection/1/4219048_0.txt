The federal gun law of 1968 prohibits sales of guns through the mail (and also online).  You can shop for them online, but you have to go through a dealer to actually finalize the purchase, verify your ID and background, etc.  The only time I ever heard of someone buying a gun online was when someone forged a dealer ID of some kind, which is a SERIOUS FEDERAL CRIME.

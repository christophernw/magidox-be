That's kind of closed-ended question.  But, I think there is a perception that we're not very sophisticated?  However, America is so huge that I think it's impossible to for Europeans to overgeneralize and dislike "Americans".  I think, politically, I can understand if they equate the Bush administration to Americans and dislike us because of his administration.  Otherwise, I don't think it's possible all Europeans dislike all Americans.

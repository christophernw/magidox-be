I think the laws have become extreme and although I can see why they are there to prevent passive-smoking, they inhibit people's freedom at the same time.. . There is so much campaign out there to stop people from smoking full stop and not just in pubs but at the workplace too.  I guess this is good when fires can be started from not puting out a cigarrette and that makes sense.  . . But if they are going to ban smoking they may as well ban drinking when there so many accidents on the roads relating to drink.  . . They may as well ban anything that is seen as a threat to human life itself because the way we are going, we are going to be dead anyway from all of the pollution and global warming! - so, yes, I think that banning smoking is ridiculous when governments won't fork out money they tax us, to stop the effects of global warming. . . Instead they tax us more for the problems that they have created!

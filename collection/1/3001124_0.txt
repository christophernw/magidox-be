Usually these numbers have recurred in a persons life several times, and they associate them with good things.  For instance, a child may say 5 is his lucky number because that was his number while playing t-ball.  Once you "pick" a lucky number, you tend to notice it in a good context for a very long time.  The truth is, it could be any number.

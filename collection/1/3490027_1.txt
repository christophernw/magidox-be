first of all you need to stop comparing urself to other ppl....no two persons are alike,remember that, take some time out by yourself and seach ur heart...ask urself ,what has happened to you in the past which may influence you to feel this way,because sometimes things happens to us which affects our entire view of ourselves,and untill wefirst deal with those issues we will be forever trapped within ourself. take my advice....get out of your house...take a long walk..listen to some music...take it slow...u dont have to judge yourself by the characteristics of others..in doing so ,you are ignoring your very own unique characteristics.we are all beautiful sweetheart......never put yourself down ..,

Hi,. . I suggest that you use a gentle soap like  Ecover for delicates and mix it with some luke warm water  and hand wash (the dye will come out of them, so wash separately) . Rinse and pat dry, then allow to dry naturally.  You can brush up the suede with a suede brush to get them back to looking how they were.. . Hope that helps. . Rosie

Light is created from illuminated Electron Shells which creates what is called Physical Light. The Human eye perceives what we call light based on a very limited frequency on the Electromagnetic Spectrum.These become Iluminated Particles that are perceived as a very narrow wavelength on the ElectroMagnetic Spectrum. Ultimately these particles are a finite Source of Energy based on this Side of Hydrogen. On the other side of Hydrogen we have Sub-Atomic Particles that make it possible for what we call Light to exist. The Original Light came into Being by Command of the Creator.

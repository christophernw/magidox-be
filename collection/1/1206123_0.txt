One glass of 100% Cranberry Juice (look at the label) an hour for the hours that you are awake - when you cannot tollerate it straight then mix 1/2 water into it.....you can also get "AZO Cranberry" pills that are 900mg. of concentrated cranberry!!! these work great for me along with the cranberry juice - i take three pills when i feel it coming on and start up the liquid - take 6 pills all in 1 day! AZO can be found in the 'vitamin' section of your local Walmart.

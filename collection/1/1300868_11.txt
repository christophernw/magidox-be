Mormon Temples are the holiest places within the cult; they are not museums open to the  public. Only certain cult members are allowed to go into the Temples. And only cult members of the absolute highest order are allowed to go into the Main Temple. . . Do you think that you want to be a Mormon, and that going into a Temple will reveal what it is like? . . Do not be naive. Run for your life.

Agree with all the people who posted above me.. I mean, why in "posted" the E is pronunced differently than "me"?. The word "blue", as far as I know, is pronunced BLOO.  No E sound there.. The word "there".  What the heck is up with that word.  the TH sounds like a D, and the last E isn't even pronunced.. Who ever thought of the idea of writting two O's in order to make it sound like a U.. Or why would you need two L's in "really"?  Or two D's in "add"?  Or the H in "why" or "what"?. And many many other words.. . By the way, I just want to make a comment on El Sancho.  He said the french don't say "e-mail", but I have a pen pal who lives in france, and we talk by e-mail, and she calls it e-mail too.  So there.

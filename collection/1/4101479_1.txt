Of course,nowadays students are making a beeline for degrees and a science degree is coveted,why do you think this will happen if people din't reap its fruits!??.   A degree takes you places,you can be independant and earn yr own living,it betters your chances of finding an efficient/able/smart  groom, it is yr ticket in landing high profile jobs based on yr specialisation,hence its a good idea to build on this BSc degree with a specialisation degree in demanding subjects today like biotechnology etc,.The more you climb the ladder of higher education,the more glittering future prospects for you both personally and career wise,so don't sit back and doubt that degree,,,strive to build on it more ,interviewers (prospective employers) will hog yr heels!!

Is u'r cat siamese?  lol.  some cats do it as a behavioral thing.  Some want the attention.  We have a cat that meows when he looks for his "baby"  a small piece of tissue, small stuffed animal, small hand towel, whatever he can carry.  Hes weird. No worries, as long as u'r cat eats, doesn drink excessive amounts of water, seems to have no signs of infection around the surgery site (if spaying occured recently) has no vomiting and no diarrhea, no wieght loss and is current on all vaccines.  Shes probably just talking to u.

Law of Thermodynamics: Calories in vs calories out.. No matter what you do, if you are eating too many calories you will Not lose weight.  You can have a six pack but if you have 2inches of fat in the stomach you will not see your muscle tone.  You have to pull back your calorie intake more, bottom line.. All diets have a goal, to make calorie reduction less torturous.  No matter what diet you are on, it all boils down to calories.  Always take a multi vitamin, research shows you would have to eat 4000 calories a day to get all vitamins needed and you do not want to do that.

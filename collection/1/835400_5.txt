You could be allergic to soap. I know it sounds daft but I am. Plenty of soaps are soap free nowadays. I am only allergic on my toes so you may be only allergic on your hands, feet and arms. Mine is a mild allergy but yours may be stronger. Go to your doctor and if he/she can't diagnose you, ask to be referred to a specialist.

This phrase is misleading.  The "dictionary meaning" is a loose reference to what is known as the "denotative" meaning of a word, that is, what the word specifically and concretely names.  There are other meanings, called the "connotative" meaning, which is what the word "connotes," or  what it implies or suggests or is associated with beyond what its literal meaning is.

For higher contrast, use a red filter.  And (as stated before) set your camera to black and white mode rather than doing it later in Photoshop.  Above all, remember that without color the most important things are shape and shadow.  Without either, your photos will be very boring.. . -- Richard Rasner. Nakayama Studios

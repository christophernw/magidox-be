Must be because the word luck has been misinterpreted.. We can think of luck as the kind of thing . that you can have in a casino.. Etymological cnnectins are boubtful,. but it can be said that luck is akin to . the German lucht, Light.  . If one wishes a being 'good light', . it is wishing that the the being . is blessed with the light of consciousness.. . Love and peace to All,. John.

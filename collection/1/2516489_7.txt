When the mother has been infected by Candida Albicans. If you are still nursing I recommend that you regulate your sugar intake&use HEALTHY TRINITY FROM NATREN. I also recommend that you don't do any cleanses until you are not nursing because some cleanses may contain herbs which have Berberine like Goldenseal and Oregon Grape root  Berberine is a natural anti- biotic and before you do any cleanse check to see if whether or not Nursing mothers can use them. The main thing I would do is EFA's(Essential fatty Acids) Omega 3-6-9 or plain Omega 3 from Nordic naturals is recommended.

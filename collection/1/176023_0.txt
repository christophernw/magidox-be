The initial dehydration (probably via E2 mechanism with water acting as base) forms 3-methyl-1-pentene.. . That alkene is protonated by the acid present in solution (required to perform dehydration) to form a secondary carbocation.  That cation can deprotonate back to the starting alkene or to the 3-methyl-2-pentene.  The equilibrium favors the more highly substituted alkene (3-methyl-2-pentene has three alkyl groups on the double-bonded carbons).

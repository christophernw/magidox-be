i don't abuse anyone , allot of it is ignorance , but some people like the elderly who fought for this country and payed taxes all there lives are put on the scrap heap and are not payed enough to get by .i resent the fact that they are not put first before an immigrant coming to this country !  its not you re fault but the  fault of the government !

the CURE depends on the cause - virus, bacteria, vocal abuse...  you'd have to see a physician for a diagnosis and appropriate recommendation for treatment/prescription.. . Relief of the soreness can be obtained through over-the-counter pain medications, like Tylenol or Advil, as well as by lozenges or sprays that contain analgesics (they usually taste bad, though!). Salt water gargles are also nasty to taste, but help kill germs and speed recovery time.

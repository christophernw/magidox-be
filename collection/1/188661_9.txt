Don't strain at the stool or when lifting etc. Also try not consuming much caffiene. Use preporation H or other when necessary. Understand what a hemmoroid is. It is a swollen vein in the rectum that extrudes through the anus. If you are overweight, try losing. I found that walking regularly, cutting out caffiene, and losing weight have been the most effective.

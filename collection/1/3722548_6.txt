To meditate is the action.  To meditate is to know that the mind is redirecting...not stopping.  The definition of meditation is...to think upon.  That is an indication the mind is not stopped.  It also indicates that it is about redirecting thoughts and we all have them, so no one is exempt from the ability to meditate.

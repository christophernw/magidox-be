As an old bag...I was an avid reader growing up. My family always gave books as gifts and my parents are still, at 76 and 78 avid readers. I can't sit still for long without reading or doing something - like Answers - I have to be taking information in.  I have found, however, the younger generation have a need for rapid-fire intake whereas my generation is far more relaxed about our information intake.  Kind of like when I watch MTV and it's flashing pictures at me and nothing stays still and I get angry and click over to watch something that isn't an assault on the eyes. Reading is too slow for most people these days...

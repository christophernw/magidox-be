The colour of gold is directly related to its purity. Crystallised gold and silver have the same atomic structure and their atoms are nearly identical in size, so that natural alloys of gold and silver are common. Pure, or 24-carat gold, is the brightest yellow, but as the amount of silver increases the colour becomes paler. Pale gold containing more than 20 per cent silver (corresponding to about 20-carat gold or less) has been called electrum. Trace amounts of copper, iron and palladium can also substitute in gold. Man-made alloys of gold with rhodium, iridium or palladium, intended to give gold greater hardness when used in jewellery, have been given names such as ‘white gold’. The carat scale is commonly used in jewellery, while in mining, an alternative scale uses ‘fineness’ of gold, where a figure of 1000 corresponds to pure or 24-carat gold. . .

a few reasons..... 1. the chemical and the balance pan will react esp if metal!. 2. prevent contamination... 3.lets you get it all off the scale so you know exactly how much you've got..imagine leaving 1gram of KOH on the pan ...not gonna have the right results.... 4. if theres wind or anything like that, it might get blown off whereas if in a crucible it wont... 5..do you wana clean up a piece of equipment which can cost rediculous amounts of money depending on the sensitivity?

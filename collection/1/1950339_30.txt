Domestic chickens are divided into two types, the overbred leghorn crosses which are too lazy to cross the road and  the other breeds (like 'heavy' hens) which are generally brown egg layers and have at least some sense.  In general, they are only interested in a few things: food, water, shelter(nesting site), reproduction, protection of chicks, and escape from predators.  I'll go with the last category and guess that the answer is to escape the ghost of colonel Saunders.

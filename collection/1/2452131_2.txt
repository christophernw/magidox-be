yes there is a way to do it so it looks like no tempering was doneI done it a couple of times. but it is not worth the conciquences to slow it down   but it is highly ilegal and could get you 20 years or more and a $50,000 find or both if caught.  so I will not even go there. if you are still thinking that get that out of your head!

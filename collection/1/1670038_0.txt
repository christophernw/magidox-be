Follow the Jorge Cruise diet. It's designed so that you safely lose two pounds every week. Plus, it doesn't exclude certain types of food - with every meal you have one carbohydrate, one protein, and one vegetable. His books are straight forward and easy to understand (almost ridiculously easy). Yes, it's somewhat cheesy and motivational. BOTTOM LINE: it works.

The forerunner of the DTMF (dual tone multi frequency ) push button was the rotary dial.  The rotary dial used pulses to send it's signals instead of tones (one pulse for the digit 1, two pulses for the digit 2 etc and ten pulses for 0)  The standard rotary dial started with the one as the first digit and zero as the last.  This was necessary as the design of the dial was spring loaded and the more you moved it the more pulses you got.  When the DTMF dial was created and to avoid confusion or wrong numbers being dialed they kept the sequence the same.

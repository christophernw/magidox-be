She probably has conjunctivitis, a viral infection in the eye.. Just a warm washcloth on the eye is all you can do at this point.. It will just take a few weeks for this to go away if that is what she has. It is miserable but she will get some antibiotic eye drops to keep it from getting a secondary infection.. I had that for three months and I had tiny blisters on my cornea and couldn't see almost but it finally cleared up and went away.. It will probably spread to the other eye.. She should not be around other kids as it is highly contagious.. . It takes time for it to go away so hang in there. Warm gentle washing and warm wash cloths held on it is about all you can do.

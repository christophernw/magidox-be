If you think of it from a biological(and medical) point of view, you must have some condition which causes one or the other. Take your pick of culprits. After you get one or the other, the biology explaination kicks in. The human body strives to keep a neutral ph balance. Not acidic, not alkaline. When you vomit, you are removing stomach acid. The most powerful natural acid in our body. Doing so causes an imbalance towards alkalinity. So the body wants to higher the acidity and lower the alkalinity. Diarherra strips the body of fliuds, thus flushing out the alkalines and causing the acid concentration to rise in the body. Unfortunately this also causes dehydration. That is why it kills so many infants in third world countries. It also works in reverse if you get diarherra first. So you see, that is why the two usually go hand and hand.

Yes it should but only to an extent.  I think as long as you are using a hands free then it is fine because it is just like talking to another person in the car.  there are way to many people that get into accidents because they are using one hand to hold there phone up to there ear.  I was rear ended by a chick that was talking on the phone and had not realized that i had been stopped for about 20 seconds.  today a chick in front of me hit her breaks for no reason other then she had to find her phone and answer it i almost hit her we were all doing like 70 the all of a sudden she slams on her breaks and swerves.  those are not isolated i see it happen all the time my commute is about an hour one way and i see people all the time that can not stay in there lane or maintain speed because they have a phone stuck to there head.  Now i use a hands free and don't have any problem, that is not to say some people don't i am sure some get so distracted from there conversation that they stop paying attention.  I do think that using a hands free will cut down the amount of accidents related to cell phone use

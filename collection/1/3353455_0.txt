I've lived in Arizona for about 14 years now, and I've seen snow down in the Tucson valley about 2 inches deep.  Don't get me wrong, it reaches near 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, but snow is still possible.  The snow seems to come later, though...we get more snow in April/May than we do during the holiday season.  Don't expect a white Christmas.  :)

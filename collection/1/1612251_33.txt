I'm sorry Duckie, you're saying that God is a man! In fact, it can't have any gender, because if it had, it would be imperfect, and God can't be imperfect. So, that's impossible. We, human beings, attribuite that property to God to THINK it. That's ours limitation. It's not the case that it is.. . If we amploy "he" to refer to it, it's for linguistics limitation, patriachal culture, not because some one found a way to check God's sexuality-gender.. . Man and woman are human creations. The idea of "man", as well as woman's, is historically constructed. To be a man today differs from to be a man in 2000 years ago. Tobe a man in the United States differs from what it is in Trinidad and Tobago or in the Indian communities around the world.. . Ah, I ain't speaking on the material stuff.

Because our parents think of us devils. they think that we would go smash things and get drunk on the first chance we get. take yesterday for example. we had a social party thingy at ma work yesterday( i wrk at a hospital i am 18) and anyway we were allowed to bring one guest. i wanted to bring my friend but ma mom made me take her and at the party she was like make sure you dont get a drink. i mean ok so i got a drink ticket but i was not gonna use it. i got it cuz the guy knew me and he was being a friend thinking maybe i wanted a drink.

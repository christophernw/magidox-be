Becoming a Christian should not be some type of fire insurance for someone.  If you honestly have to ask why you should become a Christian then I think you should go back and re-read, re-hear the true gospel message and you will know why.  Not because of a selfish ambition to see what you can get out of it.  It should be so that God can receive the glory and honor that he deserves.  He created the whole world and, sent his Son to die for OUR sins just so we could be with Him and give Him the glory He deserves.

what they all said is true but, all these items are not run by the battery its self... the alternator produces the amperage to run them. the battery is mostly used on intial start up, if you over crank your car starter the battery will drain prematurely. a main reason why the battery drains is that the batter produces hydrogen so in time the acid will not activate and the gas will take over the battery causing your battery to run out. i would check your battery for the replacment warrenty or if it's new how long it is so you can take it in.

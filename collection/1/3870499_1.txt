Your question is valid.. Thre is a very complicated method for predicting events in people's lives. But to predict numbers theat will with a lottery is not possible with astrology.. It IS possible to predict numbers psychically if you know the method to do it.. You get a psychic impression of moving an object to another spot in the house if the number that comes up is 5, for instance.. . So the day before they draw the winning numbers, you would see  yourself moving the book to the chair. . Then after they draw the winning numbers one of the numbers is 5 so you move the book to the chair.. You plan in advance that if say 5 comes up you will move a book to a chair, if 3 comes up you will move a lamp to the floor, things like that and when the next day comes and you see the winning numbers you actually do those things that go with the winning numbers.. That way, the day before the drawing, you can visualize if you are moving the lamp to the floor, the book to the chair, and if you are you know 3 and 5 come up.. You can see how hard that is though.

We all are judged on our own choices.  If we choose to round up people to kill them, we pretty well know what His judgement would be.  But if He stirs up some people to stop those who are rounding up people to kill, then God really deserves some of the credit.  He gives us place to stand in--that is why His Book has persisted and influenced us for literal thousands of years.  Sometimes we don't recognize it.  Sometimes we don't have the courage to act on our convictions.  Sometimes we judge His direction as just an inconvenient thought.  Sometimes He has us stop bad things and we don't realize how bad they were until much, much later.  Like Rwanda, like Sudan, like Iraq before G W Bush stopped that petty little tyrant from sending his sons and thugs out to rip out tongues of those who speak against him; who imprison children to keep parents inline; who torture athletes for not winning; who feed dissidents alive into meat grinders; and who proclaims a general amnesty while keeping his political dissidents in prison and dumping every theif, murderer, and rapist back out on the streets to harrass the public again.  Now, as with before World War II, we have people who opposed God at work, calling people like Churchill and Roosevelt dangerous to world peace when preparing to confront the evil of their day.

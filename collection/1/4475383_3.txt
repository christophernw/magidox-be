I don't about Paul Sorvino but when I used to have terrible trouble (especially in the mornings) I would have to resort to lifting my arms over my head to breath, but it worked. . . I would sit on the edge of the bed, lift up my arms like I was doing the wave and that REALLY helped A LOT (effects seem to last even longer than with the albuterol. Not to mention it helped calm me down a bit as well which is always good when you are having an attack. Looks a bit silly, and it is more for acute attacks, but it does work.. . Anyway, good luck!

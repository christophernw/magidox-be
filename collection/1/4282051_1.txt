"Right" is such a strong term.  You certainly are free to ask and they are free to decline to answer.  As a manager, I would never answer that question as phrased.  As a candidate, I would never ask it.. . How they will react will depend on their corporate culture, policies and the individuals involved.  Answering it would be very problematic (fodder for litigation, bad feelings, etc.) and would not help anyone -- the employer has already made their decision. . . OTOH, I am typically willing to answer something like, "What skills should I focus on to be more competitive in the future?"  Or any of the many similar issues, "What did you really like about my cover letter/interview/experience/etc?"  Or even, "What do you think my weaknesses were as a candidate?". . And of course a general conversation about what general qualifications they are looking for seems fairly safe ground for the employer.. . In other words,  I am happy to talk to the candidate about them (or in general about the position) but I would never compare them to any other candidate. . . Three final thoughts:. a) Be prepared for some answers that may not be a thrill to hear -- and some you do not agree with.  Try to view them as constructive advice on how to be more competitive in the future.  Introspection is a good thing.. b) Accept the employers current decision.  Focus on the future.  It may or may not have been the best one but they had the right to make it and they are not going to change it.  (Provided that they have not conducted the hiring in a way contrary to federal, state, local laws and any applicable contractual requirements).. c)  Communicate that you are looking forward and trying to improve your skills and abaility to be a more competitive candidate in the future.  Don't argue and make the meeting a posiive one.

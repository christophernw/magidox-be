The essential difference between them is that in an ionic bond, the electron almost completely moves to another atom (creating an ion), while in a covalent bond, the electron is shared between the two atoms in the bond. That said, in real life, every bond has some covalent and some ionic character.. . Examples: The bond between Na and Cl in table salt is primarily an ionic one, while the bond between oxygen and hydrogen in water are mostly covalent.

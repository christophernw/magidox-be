Heavier than air aerodynes, including autogyros, helicopters and variants, and conventional fixed-wing aircraft (airplanes or aeroplanes). Fixed-wing aircraft generally use an internal-combustion engine in the form of a piston engine (with a propeller) or a turbine engine (jet or turboprop), to provide thrust that moves the craft forward through the air. The movement of air over the airfoil produces lift that causes the aircraft to fly.

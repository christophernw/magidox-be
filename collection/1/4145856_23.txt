The Mexicans are noticed more because they are the ones that are screaming equal rights for all, even though they are here illegally.  We have illegals from other countries here, but they are more or less quiet because of fear of being returned to their countries.   Mexicans believe they should regain back the land that was taken from them in the Spanish/American war.  If they really want to be here and work, live a good life, then why are they so afraid of going the proper route to gain entrance into the United States?  . . We all come from immigrate families.  Some have been here for generations, others a few years; but here legally.   I don't think many Americans would be against the Mexican so much, if the Mexicans would come in the legal way.  But, since they come in the illegal ways, that's what makes most Americans against them being here.  . . They have broken the laws, why should they get handed a silver platter?  Most Mexicans get 10,000$, a home, and a job from our government.  What ticks me off is this:  Our government taxes us out the arse and will not give those Americans that apply for disability the money, yet they will hand out money to the illegals, to countries that really don't appreciate the "hand out".. . This current administration has gotten us so far in debt, it will take generations to come to get us in the black.  That's if we are even still a nation at that time.. . I know I sort of got off your question, but it still comes down to the Mexican and others that are here illegally that has helped pull our nation down.   Soon our nation will fall from within as many other countries are waiting to happen.. . We were a 'super power' but not any more.  We have lost a lot of allies over this current administrations decision.  Why?  Because it has lied time and time again to not only the American people but to the world.   Liars are NOT well liked now are they?

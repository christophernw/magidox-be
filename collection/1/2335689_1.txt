It is for the skiiers. There has to be enough snow to cover the rocks and things on the mountainside to ski. The resort people depend on the money generated every year from skiiers. So to bring people to the area  they must have snow. The resorts are only open during the winter months and they can only stay open when there is snow. If they don't get enough real snow to open then they have to add artificial snow so it isn't dangerous for the skiiers.

I would take your dog to a groomer at least for the first time.  Have the groomer show you the correct way to do it. Then if you want to do it yourself, you will know how. .  . Cutting dog hair and cutting people hair are 2 totally different things.  How many times has  your son peed or pooped while you cut his hair? Or spin around in circles, jump on you or try to bite you when you are trying to trim their bangs? I'd guess never! At least I hope not LOL

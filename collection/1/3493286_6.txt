VOLUMETRIC EFFICIENCY. The key to producing power in an internal combustion engine is volumetric efficiency. An engine can make more power with the same amount of fuel if it can get more air(or specifically oxygen) into the combustion chamber and then vent that gas. Turbochargers and superchargers force more air into the intake of a motor. Some manufacturers these days are favoring the turbocharger because it is "free energy" since it runs off the exhaust gases where as a supercharger usually runs off the serpentine belt in effect making the engine work harder than it would without the supercharger. In the end, car manufacturers have started using more turbochargers these days to get better fuel mileage out of that vehicle and sell more cars to make more money.

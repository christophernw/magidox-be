Christmas celebrates the birth of Christ but the date of the celebration has less to do with that and more to do with the Pagan winter festival celebrated on the Winter Solstice.. . I would say it's almost 'natural' for people to celebrate at this time because the nights start to become shorter and the days longer.  So perhaps on a sub-conscious level there is a need to mark this time and what better way than a celebration?  Of course on a conscious level, when everyone else is having a good time you either tend to get caught up in the mood too, or you can go the other way and reject it all, but i guess it's human nature to go with the crowd.. You certainly don't have to believe in Jesus to celebrate that time of year - that time of the yearly cycle, the solstice, has been happening millions of years longer than the Christian festival, so maybe it is deeply ingrained in the human psyche.. . That's my thought anyway!. Happy Winter Solstice!

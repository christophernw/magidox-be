you have just encountered the PARADOX. this is the very root of phylosophy. so which came first, the chicken or the egg? well the egg answer isbacked by an apparently compelling principle: every chicken comes from an egg. the trouble is that there is an equally compelling principle supporting the opposite answer: every egg comes from a chicken. the riddle of the chicken and the egg rests on a false presuppostion. niether came first because each chicken comes from anegg and each egg comes from a chicken. chickens have only been around for a finite amount of time, therefore eggs must have preceeded chickens or vice versa. EGGS NEED TO BE HATCHED, AND CHICKS NEED TO BE REARED, THEREFORE SOME NONCHICKEN MUST HAVE SERVED AS A PARENT. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE WAS A CHICKEN EGG BEFORE THERE WERE ANY ADULT CHICKENS. HA

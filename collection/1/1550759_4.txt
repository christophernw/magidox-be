some girls bleed for several days after they lose their virginity...some don't bleed at all, it's just a matter of their body....one possible explaination is if you were using a condom with spermicide (noxonyl-9) and you are allergic to spermicide it can cause soreness and bleeding..or maybe he's just alittle to rough...who knows

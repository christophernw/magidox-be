The "Bill of Rights" was written to prevent a governmental power from circumscribing the rights of perople, which rights the signers declared elsewhere were "endowed by their Creator" and "unalienable".. . The Second Amendment is only written recognition of a human right. So in one sense the "Second Amendment" is 2XX years old... and the principle behind it dates back to the Fall and Eden.

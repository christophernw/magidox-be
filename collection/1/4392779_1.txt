if she where mine i would be feeding her large rabbits, nothing bigger than the size she is at the biggest point of her body, and it is NOT a good idea to let her out of her cage to run arround the house, this is how you loose a snake, or how you loose a pet to bieing eaten by a snake. Supervised play time is a good thing, un supervised, not a good thing, you wouldnt belive how much trouble a snake that big can get into in just a short period of time, or the amount of things they can break. to judge how often you should feed her  feed her when she will eat, and wait untill she deficates, after she deficates feed her again, so basically feed her the next day or so after she goes potty!

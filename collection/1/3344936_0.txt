The rooster (male chicken) is much larger than a female hen and usually overpower them into mating. They peck down on the back of her head and pin her to the ground, stand over her, and press their rear ends together where some genital interaction occurs. The whole process takes all of 5-10 seconds and is almost comical to see.

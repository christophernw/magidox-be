Here in Texas, I once went to the local Texas Alcohol Beverage Commission office or somesuch named State department and reported such a violation at a bowling alley "bar and grill".  The "in-house" bar and grill stayed open, but subsequent to the commissions on-site inspection, it became much more difficult to violate their laws, including selling alcohol to persons appearing under the influence or already having bought numerous beers.

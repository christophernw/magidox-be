I just wanted to clear up something...all you need to be a college "instructor" is a bachelors degree. In order to be a "professor", you need a doctorate. Most instructor positions will hire someone who has some type of teaching experience and you don't have to necessarily start out at a community college if you don't want to. You may want to look at teaching some University 101 classes to start out if you lack the experience.

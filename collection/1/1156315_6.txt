MONEY is NOT the root of all evil.  That would be GREED and SELFISHNESS.. . Money is a necessity.  It buys food, shelter, and everything else we need in life.  People who have absolutely no money are virtually always unhappy.  If you were starving to death, I think you might be unhappy, too.. . The mistake is trying to use money to buy happiness instead of contentment.  That is something it cannot do.  Happiness must be found within yourself and those around you.  Using money to find it is usually a futile endeavor.. . There have been surveys that prove this.  The poor are always the least happy, but there is very little difference in happiness between the truly rich and those who simply have enough money for necessities.

Despite the repeated claims that this war is for merely oil, it may be that this war was merely to establish a permanent US military presence in a puppet state, so that domination of the entire region might be affected.  So, yes, it may be for oil, but not just Iraqi oil; this is for control of oil throughout the entire region. . . As to when our involvement will end, it is unlikely that the US will withdraw until we have found alternative methods of supplying our energy needs. Permanent bases are highly probable at this point.  On the other hand, the US might pull out if the economic and political consequences of this conflict make the cost of maintaining a prescence in Iraq too high.

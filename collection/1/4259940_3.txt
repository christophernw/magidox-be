no, of course not God knows what is in your heart. If you are that uncomfortable doing it though you may want to research another church or another religion. Many churches are judgemental and hypocritical and because the bible says come to him as child they treat all of us as children and tell us what to do because they have come to believe they know what is best. Only you can decide what is best for you. If it's not natural God doesn't want it anyway. I mean it's not like you can lie to him.

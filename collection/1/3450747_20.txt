Go seek professional help... I donot know where your anger stems from exactly but it would have helped me answer this question in more depth. If your father( God forbid) abused you in some way...you may have the right to be angry but the way you express anger may be the problem or a problem to come. Search the net for resources in your local area try words like that pertain to your proble and then limit them for more results...I hope you can find what you need to live up to your full potential... a beautiful strong Woman

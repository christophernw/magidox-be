isn't it that every planet has a different gravitational field, for example, the earth has one of 10N while the moon has another? Also, perhaps the fact that each planet is made up of different elements, e.g. the earth is mostly made up of molten iron while Jupiter is made of gaseous elements, might affect a planet's gravitational field.

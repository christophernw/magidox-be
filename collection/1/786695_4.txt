Not at all.  If President Bush killed an entire region of democrats with chemical weapons as well as a portion of Canada, do you not think that once power was taken away from, he would not be tried in US courts for the US crimes prior to anything else.  He may very well end up in court cases in several arenas.  Similar to the Lee Malvo sniper shootings and three seperate jurisdictions.  The Iraqi courts had first crack at the case.  Not that it will matter, it is kind of lame if you ask me when someone gets a death penalty from more than one jurisdiction... I mean you just got sentenced to death, do you really give a crap if you get sentenced to death again somewhere else?  In Sadam's case, it would simply give him a pulpit to spew more of his hatred.

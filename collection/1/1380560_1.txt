Go to the drug store and buy some over-the-counter wart removal liquid.  Apply as directed on the box.  Cover it with Duct Tape....yes Duct Tape! Leave it on until it is ready to come off by itself and the wart should come off with it.  If it is really big and goes really deep, this might not work, so I'd seek the attention of a physician if it doesn't.

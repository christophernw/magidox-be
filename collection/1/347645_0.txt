no, my friend you got it wrong.... Actually Islam teaches peace and harmony if you read the Koran and as for the terrorists, they aren't considered muslims anymore, they just pretend they are on jihad, but they really don't have any religious motive behind them. They misinterperete the Islamic religion, so dont listen to them and stop stereotyping! the real ones who teach to hate are people like you who post questions with non-relevant facts and try to make others look bad!!!!!

Those people buy alot of tickets in advance for a cheap bulk price, or they are fakes, then they wait till the concert is sold-out and sell great seats at high prices. Ticket scalping is illegal, and they can get into trouble, and you can also (depending on the cop, and if he just gives you a warning). And if you want great tickets, you should go online and see if you can buy the tickets in advance, most of the time they are cheaper, and you can find a great seat.

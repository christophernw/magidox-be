There is nothing bad about living in a trailer. As long as you are kind to yourself and others that is what counts to me. You are not the only one that get judge by where you live. I have friends, family that live in housing projects that work everyday and are good people who are judged unfairly by where they live at. There is good and bad in all areas of the world and to be judged by where you live is cruel and senseless.

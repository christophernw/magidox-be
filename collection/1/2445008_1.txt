No this was before the revolution. The original charter for the colony of Carolina, which was split into N & S very early on, was to include all the land from Atlantic Coast to the other side (which they really didn't know that much about).. They didn't know how big N. America was. Only later on did they realize this, and by the revolution, the colonies' boundaries had pretty much been set. A few might have wanted to claim more land, as much of Eastern Tennessee was actually originally part of North Carolina (albeit more of a territory). This was just not really practical. Only in theory was part of California in Carolina.

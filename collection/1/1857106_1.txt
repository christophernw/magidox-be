Only a guess, but I'd think it's because the huge amount of torque that a differential would need to pass would make it impractical. Too big to carry the loads required? Easier to allow some slip or have individual wheel set drive control? I've never seen very sharp radius curves on rails, either.. But, maybe computer controls for individual drive motors have been used for a while... as sort of a differential?

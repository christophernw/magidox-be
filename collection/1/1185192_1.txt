You already have some good answers.  I would tell them that they can do better and should do better.  I think that anyone who just makes minimum wages could tell them to get an education !  Even if it's just graduating high school.  Getting a GED is not quite the same.  Who wants to work two jobs @ minimum wage just to pay all the bills ?  Money is a great motivator...they can get money the right way by working or they can get money the wrong way, by stealing or whatever.  Just ask the people who are in prison.  I doubt that there's very many college grads or even high school grads.  But they went for the easy way of having more money.  . Oh, and how many homeless people do you think graduated ?  Very few, if any.  If they don't think they can handle college,  there are places where they can learn a skill.. Some kids will listen to you and some won't.

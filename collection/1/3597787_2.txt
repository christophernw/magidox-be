somebody who has experienced panick attacks for at least 5 years i feel i'm in two minds what it was you had! My first panick attack came on like yours totally out of the blue while I was in a dance lesson. I don't know about you but I thought I was having a heart attack and thought I was going to die. I went to the doctor straight away and with one look he said it was a panick attack. I was very relieved but unfortunately got into a spiral of pannicking about having a panic attack, which made me have them all the more. I'm hoping that because you had one that wasn't in public this won't be a problem for you. Panick attacks can become a habit like biting your nails. Try and remember the fight or flight syndrome too. You were obviously startled and not having time to think your brain reacted quicker than your body. It might have just been your bodies way in catching up with itself. Back to being in two minds I dont think it was a panic attack, I think it was what I just said... keep wellX

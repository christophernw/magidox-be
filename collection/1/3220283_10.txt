There are many answers to this complex question.  People emigrate for different reasons and they must be serious reasons if they're willing to leave their country, their family and everything they have.  No one would like to do things illegally but unfortunately, when you are in a desperate situation (poverty, lack of political freedom, persecution, etc.), you look for a way out.  People would love to come to this country --or any other country--the legal way. Unfortunately, the US has a limit on visas and some countries get no visas at all, meaning that people are denied the legal way in.  So they look for other ways to get here in the hopes that here they will find a job, be able to build a better future for their children, have basic freedoms, education, be who they want to be.  People who pay thousands of dollars to hide in a trunk of a car to cross the border are DESPERATE people.  we're not talking about a middle-class US citizen who needs a change of scenery.  These people have no income, no future and no hope.  Unfotunately, some of them come here and do things to ruin it for other hard working immigrants.  But before you generalize or put immigrants down, take a trip to a third world country and put yourself in their shoes.

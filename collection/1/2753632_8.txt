There are a lot of thoughts on it.  One of them is that red was the cheapest paint.. . Farmers made the paint themselves -- skim milk, lime, linseed oil, and iron oxide, better known as rust. The red was the result of the rust.  It coated the lumber on the barns and wore well.  When more colors of paint became available, farmers stuck with the red, more out of entropy than anything else.

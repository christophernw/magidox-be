SO the correct form of your question would be:. . Why should we allow minimum wage to raise in the United States?. . answer:. . It is actually very complex what can occur if min. wage was able to go up more. That would mean the cost of things would go up as well. So people who make min. wage would not benefit too much because the cost of items will go up. If there was a way to allow this to happen and companies not raise the cost of goods to compensate then I think that it should go up.

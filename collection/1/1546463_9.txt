1). The idea of night and day.. . It might seem strange, but on the Earth day and night happen both at the same time. While it is daytime on one half of our globe, there is night on the other half.. . It happens so, because what we basically call "day" is, in fact, a phenomenon of the sun shining on one side of the Earth. Let's make a small makeshift model consisting of our sun, Earth and the rays the sun sends.. . (W/E)========(.....Sun.....). . Earth  Sun Rays           Sun. . W means Western hemisphere. E means Eastern hemisphere. / is the axis of the Earth (which is inclined under the 23,4Â° angle). . As the rays fall on the Eastern hemisphere of the Earth, in Russia (which lies on the Eastern hemisphere) it is day. On the other hand, as the Western hemisphere is on the other side, and the rays do not fall on it, there is night in, say, USA (which lies on the Western hemisphere). But, as the Earth rotates the hemispheres change their places:. . (E/W)===========(....Sun....). . Now it is daylight in USA, and night in Russia.. . 2). Day and night on Earth, and the Space. As we saw on those simple makeshift schemes, the day and night take place because of the rotation of our planet. But where is space in this scheme? Well, everywhere else. Space is to Sun NOT as Earth is to Sun, but as a fish swimming in the middle of the Ocean is to Ocean (although the scale is wrong... or it should be an extremely small fish...) You can't be close or far from space. Your IN IT! So is the Sun. So is our Solar system. So is our Galaxy. . . What is space then? Well, to put it in the simplest way, it is a huge vacuum well... space (in the sense of room here). Well, not exactly vacuum. There are stars, some with solar systems like ours (yes, planets. A few weeks ago Poles detected a planet around a different star. Apart from that we can proof existence of planets around other stars by tracking the changes of the star movement - it moves across the space in a slalom instead of a straight line. But that's a different story.) and lots of other stuff (comets, pulsars, black holes, asteroids, neutron stars and lost of others), whole galaxies soaring across it. But between them, there is vacuum. Now, another thing that has to be straightened out is, that our Sun is a star. It looks so big in comparison to ther stars because we are so close to it (and as we all know objects that are further seem to be smaller), and, being a star, it's not too big really.. .  Now, trying to light the space is more or less like going to a shore of the Atlantic Ocean and pouring a glass of a cherry juice into the waves in hope, that it will make the whole water taste of cherries. And that is because light is made out of photons, which are, well a kind of particles. And even if the sun produces them every second, it's impossible to make enough of them to make something that would reassemble a day because:. . 1) The space is infinite. In it's beginning, as the theory says, it has blown up out of a point of an infinite mass in vacuum, and as you know, when something blows up, there is an explosive shock wave, which has a lot of energy, and can push things away from the center of the detonation (I bet you often saw in a movie a good guy blown off his feet by the explosive shock wave of a bomb explosion, while running away from the place where it was planted). Well the "Big Bang" - as scientists call it was so strong, that it threw the whole matter with such a force, that it is still going on (our galaxy too). Yes, the space is still expanding, still growing, so the sun would have to make the photons much much faster to brighten the universe, and basically, even if all the stars would, they all taken together do not have enough fuel to make enough light to lighten the entirely space even for a fraction of a second. But they can make enough to be visible on the night sky (or to make days on their planets). Like with the juice. When yo

OK one if your the Anti-Christ you could have not had a catholic or christian Baptism. You have to have that Star thing somewhere near you at all times in order to keep you from transforming too soon. Also at your 33rd birthday you would have descended into the transformation and become the Anti-Christ and the world would have come to an end. Also to answer you about thinking about doing sins it is human nature. Human Nature is to get and adrenaline rush from doing something against their morals or something wrong. That is why there are so many sick and disturbed people out there. If you know you are good and if you want to be good then you can overcome your human urges and go about your life as pure as you can.

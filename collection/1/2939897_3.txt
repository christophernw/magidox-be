When we evolved Our diets changed and our jaw development is less now that we don't such a hard diet.  Softer processed foods yield less stimulation for jaw growth.  For those with braces, thats why face gear works to inhibit and or promote growth of the jaws using pressure.  Hence less chewing less growth.  . . Unless your a creationist.  Then the laws of Biology and equilibrium do not apply to You.

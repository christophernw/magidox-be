First of all you can not judge an entire religion by a few answers you have received by people who CLAIM to be Christian, but even if they are it is there business how they deal with their families, not for you to say they are right or wrong anyway. I think this world and its teaching it tolerant to all except for Christians, who have a right to their beliefs just as well as any other people. So who are the true hypocrites? You want respect but don't want to give it.

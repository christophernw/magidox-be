Well, some people believe God doesn't exist- but they are in for a surprise.. . God does exist. But he isn't a man, nor a woman. These parameters do not apply to God- God is an immortal spirit...he may resemble the Sun, in his physical appearance.. . God exists, whether people like it, or not. . . It doesn't matter, anyways, if God is a 'man' or a 'woman'- he/she is the creator of the universe, and is sovereign. I love God, and I don't care at all what he looks like.

Not an expert but take this on a lighthearted note.. .    Would you be as accepting of a flight that did offer parachutes, as opposed to one that didn't in their assumed or practical safety history?. .    Would you take a bus that occasionally asked its passengers to get out and push?. .    Would you know how to use a parachute in a freefall caused by any disaster, and have the ability to climb over the other 300 people in the same situation?. .    Transportation on any level is a risk. Yikes I could twist my ankle walking to my mailbox..    Study statistics and I believe you will find, in total, less people have failed to get where they are going by flying, than those commuting on any Interstate Highway system.. . Rev. Steven

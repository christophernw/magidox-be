Honestly, I'd rent a car....befriend someone here, something.  Public transport here in the D is pathetic at best, and you can thank the automotive manufacturers for it (they lobbied heavily to have NO subway, & NO local train service years ago)...thus forcing locals to buy a car.  The buses are sad, cabs outrageous.  Rent a car.

I don't know why you need it, so I have to speculate.. . I assume you mean other than your nose. Hmm. Well, there are sensors that can pick up traces of certain chemicals, but does that count as smell? Either way, I doubt these types of sensors are available for you to buy, as they are very expensive.. . WAIT. What about a dog? People have been using dogs to track things down for ages. Will a dog serve your purpose?

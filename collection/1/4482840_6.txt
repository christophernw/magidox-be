Anyway, old wive´s tale, but it´s said to work: take folic acid, it comes in capsules from herbal places or the pharmacy, but don´t EAT the contents...mix them with water and rub then on the areas you have problems with...leave on area overnight, for a couple of months...I´ve been told it works, by mu husband, who has normal growth...

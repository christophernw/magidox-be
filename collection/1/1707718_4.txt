what makes you think caveman particularly wanted to reproduce? They still wanted to have sex, just like everyone modern human and every mammal, reproduction is just the side effect of having sex (at least in an age before contraception). You might as well ask how chimpanzees figured out how to reproduce while your at it. Except we still had language and culture in that time period so the cave man probably figured out alot about sex and reproduction.

This is an effect of concavity/convexity and overhead light.  The crest of a wave is convex, and acts as a concentrating lens, meaning that the light that falls onto the crest is, on average, redirected toward the area underneath the apex of the wave, making that area brighter.  The trough is convex, and acts as a dispersing lens, meaning that light that falls into the trough is, on average, redirected away from the area underneath the trough, making that area dimmer.

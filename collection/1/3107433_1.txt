Accountability.. . It's like saying "why do Mexicans build crappier houses?", when Mexicans have as much building skill as anybody else. The people hiring them want quick and cheap.. . People build what they are held accountable to build.. . Long ago, the Japanese recognized that success in automotive manufacturing relied on quality, while American manufacturers still played the "looks good, lasts 3 years" philosophy. (they believed to make a long-lasting car would HURT sales--if a car lasted 6 years, you'd sell half as many at a higher production cost!). . The gap has closed, and the consumer is the winner! God bless capitalism and Toyota!

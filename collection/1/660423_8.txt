One verse, and I apogolize I dont' remember where it is.. . goes something like "Before you were formed in the womb, I knew you".  This implies that life begins BEFORE conception.. . That and one other thing, that sex should just be for procreation.  The Catholic church is fine with non-v@ginal sex, as long as you "finish" in the right place.  This is all about the stigma of sex as being evil and sinful.. . Unfortunate, since it is a really good time.. . In the 3rd or 4th century, the Church actually ruled that life didn't beging until the 40th day of pregnancy for a boy, and later for a girl.  I don't feel like looking it up, but a simple google search should find it.  Regardless, this shows little respect for women, and belies their position on abortion.

12-13 should be the case, but im not sure if the earlier spec model which had the last of the 2.0 16 "XE" or "redtop" engines from the cavalier GSI would be any higher by say a group or 2, my last car was a GL hatch with a XE transplant and was insured as a Grp 15 GSi. If you are looking for one of these cars try n get an earlier models with the XE as the "ecotec" engines were 15 brake horse power down on the old and far superior XE lump :)

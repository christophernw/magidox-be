Well, I guess because people are just full of B.S and they are ignorant!! If the anthem has been translated from English to Spanish was for people who doesn't speak English to understand what the hell it means. No one said anything about changing it to a Spanish version...did they? NO!! It's only has been translated...So I guess let it be that way. Same thing if the Chinese people translate the anthem into Chinese...would u blame them? NO because if they can if they want to...they won't change it for the whole u.s to sing but they are translating it for themselves...And really no one is catering anything to Mexicans...They are the ones who work hard to get what they want...and that will go on...

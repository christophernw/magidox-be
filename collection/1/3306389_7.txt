If the cyclist suddenly enters a turn, several things occur.. . The cyclist feels a force tangential to the curve.  This is due to iniertia (the bike wants to continue in the direction it was headed).  Since the wheel is on the ground, there is a frictional force inhibiting its motion in the tangential direction.  This whips the mass of the cyclist around an effective pivot, causing the cyclist to lean out of the curve.. . To counteract this, the cyclist leans into the curve.  At some angle of lean, dependent on the radius of curvature and radial speed, the cyclist center of gravity will be positioned such that tangential force is equal to the gravitational force pulling the cyclist to the ground.. . The faster you go and the tighter the curve, the farther you have to lean to stay balanced.

in my opinion a person must not drive until 18, if not 21; although i am 15 right now. driving first of all, a person is not at his full mental state. at age 21 a person if fully developed, mentally and physical. and then  do you know what booze does to your body? if you become an alcoholic at small age, you would be just getting rid of your liver, as burning a paper. you don't really want me to tell you how this happens scientifcly. at smaller age you are more exposed to getting "sick" than at older age. as  intellectual person think all booze must be illigal, due to its harm it causes a person.

First of all, the lion's share if mishaps occur either on take-off or landing... Very few incidents occur when the plane is at altitude.... . Second, what are the chances the average Joe getting on an airliner would be able to competently strap on and use a parachute?  Pretty low I would guess.. . Third, you would pretty much need straight and level flight to bail out of a plane... So if the plane is straight and level, that implies it is still flyable on some level, ergo it may still be able to land safely.. . Then of course there is expense, liability, altitude, speed, temperature, etc.

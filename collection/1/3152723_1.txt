24 karat gold is pure, 100% gold. 14 karat is 58.3% gold, plus other metals such as silver and copper.. . So you would need to melt the gold with silver (for example) - the amount of cheaper metals would need to be 71.5% of the amount of gold you have to get the correct blend. (calculation: 171.5 / 100 = 0.583)

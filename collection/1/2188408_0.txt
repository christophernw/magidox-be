put on ankle weights and keep jumping for the rim.  also since you work out try calf raises and other leg excercises.  If you are white (no offense) if you put on excessive weight from working out the upper body you will have more trouble jumping higher because of the muscle mass you are putting on.  the only reason i can touch rim is because i am a little taller and more on the skinny side.

God gave us a conscience to keep us doing the right thing.....but we have to decide to do it or not....and I am not trying to argue with you, but other living things DO have a conscience as well.....my beloved cat will sometimes get mad at me when I won't let him out (he's declawed and has to be supervised outdoors)....well, he will pout for awhile....then ...as if he were like a person would....he will "make up" with me.....I can feel it....good question though...

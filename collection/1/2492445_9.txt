I think that you're right - it's all politics, isn't it?. . I can answer your question about why meats are given different names. When the Normans (French) conquered England in the 11th century, they became the ruling class. When the English brought them meat, it was already cooks and looking tasty. So, we use the words derived from Old French such as pork, poultry, beef to describe the food, while we still use a variation of the Old English for the animal: pig, chicken, cow. . . Unfortunately, due to simple marketing, propaganda and economics, I doubt whether words such as "dead cow" or "slaughter" will ever be used to counter "beef" and "culling". There have been some improvements. In Australia, it's now law that eggs have to be labeled "battery" if they come from battery hens. I always buy free range now.  . . Hope that this answered your question!

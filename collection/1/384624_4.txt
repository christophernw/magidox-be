Yes, especially if out of ignorance you harm other people.  We are all responisible to become better people who are more aware of the consequences of their actions.  If a person on drugs is unaware of the harm they cause, they are still guilty.  Likewise, and ignorant person should be held accountable for not trying to understand his or her actions and life.

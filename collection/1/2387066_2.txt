Thermal energy is the kinetic energy and potential energy of the molecules. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy per molecule.. . The term "Heat" as uesd in this answer will refer to the change in the thermal energy of an object; thus the expressions "heat transferred" or "heat absorbed". A device used to measure temperature is called a thermometer.

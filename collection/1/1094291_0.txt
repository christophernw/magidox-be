Go to your family physician... External, middle and inner ear infections can all cause hearing loss if they go untreated for long periods of time. Don't chance any home remedies. I have had MANY external ear canal infections (otitis externa/swimmers ear) and did not seek medical attention for most of them, I now have some hearing loss in my right ear.

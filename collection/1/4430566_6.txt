in theory, when the temp reaches absolute zero everything freezes and is -459.67 degrees F.  temps within a few billionths of a degree have been reached but the materials used in the experiment took on nontraditional states.  at the temp all molecular motion would cease so it would be impossible to reach the temp exactly.

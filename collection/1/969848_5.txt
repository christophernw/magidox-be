To answer your first question ,I believe in eternal life because we are spirit, only the body dies, a spirit can not die. It will live for eternity. You should believe more in the things you can't see because they are eternal. They are more real than the seat you are sitting on. Now, the second question; Thou shalt not kill. We love our kids and can not kill them. We want to go to heaven too. God tries to get everyones attention at least once in their lifetime. We must tell our kids the truth about God and about life and it is their choice. If we pray for them, they will make it. If we obey God our family will be saved. God has made promises to those who love and obey Him.

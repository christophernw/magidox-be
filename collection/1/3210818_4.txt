Do you mean, Why do the Americans ruin our language? Hmm why are you not using a capital at the beginning of your sentence, why did you not capitalize Americans, I mean it is a pronoun, and why did you not use actual words? That was my serious side, hmm maybe because we're just stupid little fat kids, but I do have a question, how come teacher's alway's say don't have long sentences, but when we read Charles Dicken's they praise his long sentences and say how wonderfully unique his sentence's are, that is one thing that really bugs me.

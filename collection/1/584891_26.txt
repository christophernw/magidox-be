Severus Snape is one complex character; I was surprised when he himself finished the great wizard. Somehow I didn't want to believe it happened, that Dumbledore passed away. I wanted to think that it is just a part of a plot that only Rowling knows, which we will find out in the next book. If the situation is real and Dumbledore really is dead, the reasons I could think of as to why Snape did it are revenge, hatred, and loyalty - to avenge the refusal for him to teach DADA; consumed by the hatred he felt that he had to endure the time spent in the castle; loyalty to the Dark Lord, where his heart and soul resides.

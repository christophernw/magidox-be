Because we don't eat it here on a regularly or normaly.  Really, there is actually no such thing as American food since it all came from somewhere else.  But here, they "Americanized" it in some way.  When you eat Chinese food, you're not eating the same thing that they eat in China.  What they really eat over there we most likely will think is gross, so they changed it in some ways for us to eat it and like it.  Hope ya get that, lol.

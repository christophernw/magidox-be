Hi, thats a good question...my gf has trouble with that too...well either is a positive form, and neither is the negative form....neither is saying you don't do or like multiple things...either is saying you do/like/want one of mulitple things ^^ so if you think it is a positive time, use either and negative use neither....also be careful of using either in place of "also"

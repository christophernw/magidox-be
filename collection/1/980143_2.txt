Baptism is a ceremony representing Jesus' death and resurrection.  It is our first step in our Christian walk. It also symbolizes our dying to our old self and living for Christ. . . I do believe it is much, much more than just a symbol.  I believe something happens to us when we are baptized.  (No, It is not getting the HOly Spirit...)  I believe Christ meets us there in some way...he strengthens us to serve him.  He also strengthens those witnessing the baptism.

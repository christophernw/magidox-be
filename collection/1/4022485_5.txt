Humility shows that you know what an essentially (and I do mean 'essentially') pointless reality you 'enjoy'.  If you think you're big, clever and intteresting, but the Universe or less doesn't even flinch, perhaps humility is the way to go.  If you KNOW you're 'special', well, that's another matter entirely...

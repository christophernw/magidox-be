Eating cherries, tart cherries, NOT the pretty little red  marachino cherries you get in the jar, that you put on top of ice cream sundaes,  but either the fresh ones, that you get and eat like you do grapes, or eat the frozen ones.  . . They now have a concentrated Cherry Juice that you get in the health food store, it's a little expensive when you first look at the price, but you don't drink but just a little at a time, maybe a teaspoon or two at a time. Either drink it by it's self, or add some water to it. .  Occording to something I looked up on line they say  it has something in it that is in the same ingredient as one of the medications that is in the medicine they  give hospice patients for pain who have cancer. . . A cousin was having pain a few months before he passed away and I remembered about this and took him  a bottle of it, and he called me a few days later and told me he felt it helped him w/the pain.  .  . I told him that is what his sister in law had me to do when she had gout, get her fresh cherries and it helped her gout. She would eat a few everday until it was under control then she would eat a few every now and then.. . Check it out online and see what you find out.    . It is suppose to help with arthritis pain, inflamation, and I am not sure what else.  But I have problems w/painful arteries in leg, and it seems to help me to, maybe the inflamation is the reason and w/it helping inflamation, that helps to relieve pain.. . I have seen several people who use the cherries and bleieve in it.  Some may say it is folklore, but if it helps even your mind, why not do it, because pain really hurts no matter where it comes from. I don't believe it is folklore, since there are drugs on the market that have ingredients of natural things we use daily.  . Good luch w/the gout...

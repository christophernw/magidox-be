I had a lot of bad teachers.  These were the worst:  . . One was a chemistry teacher who would yell at us and call us stupid because we weren't in AP Chemistry, and he would show us surgery videos just to gross us out.  One time we made a very minor mistake in a lab project and he called off the whole thing and gave us all an "F".  He was rumored to be an alcoholic.. . Another was my fourth grade teacher who ignored the fact that I was getting beaten up in class, and who would lower my GPA every time my mother complained.  The school administration was in on it, too, routinely covering it up.  The principal is now the judge on "The People's Court".. . Another teacher was my chorus teacher, who was fired for getting a student pregnant.  It was on the news and in the paper, and the entire chorus was humiliated for the rest of my senior year.. . There was also my German teacher who would talk about politics and abuse from his childhood, and he would show us movies like "Waterworld" that had nothing to do with the subject.  There was also an English teacher who made it a rule in his class that we couldn't take the Lord's name in vain.  I also had a psychology teacher who hit on me.  . . Maybe this is why I'm having trouble showing up for classes now that I'm in college.  Just seeing the inside of a classroom gives me the creeps.

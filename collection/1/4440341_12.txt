NEVER NEVER mix finance with friendship, you will lose both the money and the friendship. Lend him $20 and end that friendship he will avoid you so as not to pay you back he sounds like a con artist.. Definetly do not co sign if he doesn't pay you will have to and if you don't it will go on your credit record.. Say  you  will not co sign. get caller ID don't answer his calls. avoid him to no ends.. . He is just an acquaintance who happened to be a co-worker at one time not a friend. Friends don't lose touch for several years.. listen to your gut instinct if you don't feel good about it don't do it.

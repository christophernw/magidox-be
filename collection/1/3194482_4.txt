ya, i've done a big multi-genre research paper on him, and i know too much info to just start naming off stuff now.  but if you need help on anything about him, i can help you.. . i think what he did was great and everything, but people have to realize that there was a lot of other people who did the same things he did, even if they didn't save quite as many jews as he did.

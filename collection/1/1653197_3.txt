are you sure it's water and not ear mites? is there a black granular substance inside the ear? If so then it's ear mites and you have to take him to the vet and get ear drops, if it's water, then it's possible to put a little bit of hydrogen peroxide in his ear, the hydrogen peroxide will dissolve the water, although I imagine your cat will flip out once you do so b/c of the constant bubbling noise it creates. Best bet, go to a vet and have him checked out just to be sure.

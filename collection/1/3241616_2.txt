I hope you want a serious answer so I'm not wasting my time here .... . Several years ago, when the Beanie Baby craze was on, I would spend my lunch hours searching for and buying the hard to find Beanie Babies. With rumors of a UPS strike looming, I knew that before too long they would be next to impossible to get.. . Sure enough, UPS went on strike and daily deliveries to stores ceased. The value of Beanie Babies SOARED. I sold all of them, except the flamingos, I couldn't part with those. I had been collecting for a couple of years nd several of them were "retired". I had about $2,000 invested in them and I paid about $600 in commissions (eBay) but even with that, my profit was $13,000.

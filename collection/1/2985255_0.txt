Not all doctors deal with people who have airborne infections, but all physicians and other healthcare workers are supposed to practice good hygiene, and also are recommended to receive flu vaccine. Most infections that doctors would be susceptible to, except perhaps tuberculosis and strep (which proper handwashing can cut down on), aren't treatable with antibiotics. In my experience, I've noticed that doctors are rather less likely to take medication than the rest of us are.

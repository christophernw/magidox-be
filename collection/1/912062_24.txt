This is a perfect question for me because I am a learning Christian as well.  From what I have learned there is a difference between repenting and asking forgiveness.  Asking forgiveness means you just ask God to forgive you for what you did because you didn't mean it, feel bad about it although you meant it and so on. But repenting is when you sin, ask for forgiveness and don't do it again. Obviously we are all sinners and sometimes it does happen again. May I suggest thinking about what led up to you doing what you did and stay away from those things as much as possible.  If it was someone you love or know you have to tell them your issue with what happened.  If it was something material you have to think about how you put yourself in that position and avoid doing it again.  Thinking about what led up to your sin is the most important step in avoiding a repeat of the sin.  I'm not an expert but what else can you do...if you just get over it and go on you might find yourself in the same situation not realizing that you did exactly what got you where you were at the last time.  Know what I mean?  It's hard...praying as much as you can helps too. I want you to know that seeking forgiveness and repenting is something to be rewarded for.  It takes a bigger person to admit sin than it does to actually commit it.  I have faith in you. Good luck!

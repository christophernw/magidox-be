While you're sleeping all that "crud" collects in you lungs and sinuses. Some of it drips down the back of your throat (post nasal drip). Mmm. Yummy. I have it to. Spend time hacking up the nights crud. Then I feel better. If it's more than this then you ought to see a doctor. Maybe you have asthma, or something.

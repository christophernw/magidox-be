Marine Corps.  It's the hardest and most challenging, during boot camp and after.  Also, after you get promoted a couple times, you'll have about the same level of responsibility as a SSgt in the Army.  . . You're right RMC, 10 Marines wouldn't make 1/2 a British soldier.  It'd be more like 30 Brits, work on your math.

Your question seems to imply that homosexuals are scorned by God. In fact, Jesus teaches that those who are persecuted in God's name are in fact blessed by God. So when the religious right demonizes gays because it is "God's will", they are in fact casting God's blessing upon them. Jesus makes it clear that his message is one of tolerance and doing unto others, not hatred and bigotry. So, I guess that gays have as much right to the rainbow as any of God's children.

Most of the ideas about hiring people just because they have degrees are seriously flawed.  There are people who have been hired just because they have a degree, no matter what it is in.  They could have a degree in ant farming and get hired as an accountant.  Then they have to be trained anyway for the job they were hired for.  And people who have actual, hands-on experience of the exact job are looked over.  I have seen this happen many times.  I do not have a degree from a college, but have attended specialty schools.  I have over 30 years education, training, and experience in my field. I am considered an expert in my field, but the first thing they ask when I interview for a job is about college degrees.  Depending on how they handle my response that I do not have one makes my decision of whether I really want to work for them or not.  The question of why they get paid more is flawed in the same way.  We have been brain-washed to think that if someone earned a college degree as opposed to years of hard, dedicated work it is somehow worth more.  This is just wrong.  The merits of both should be weighed and pay should be based on the competence and work-ethics of the individual.

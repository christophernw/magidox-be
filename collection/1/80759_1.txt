My personal belief is that many Christians on an emotional level feel that if they don't take a hard stance in certain interpretations of the Bible that other beliefs of theirs will suddenly be in question. It is a scary thing to face a radical change of ones ethos. We identify so much with our external ego that we have a hard time letting go of old beliefs. To let go of old beliefs is to let go of who we thought we were, i.e. having an identify crisis.. . Other than the above mentioned the Catholic church and politics have had a hand at shaping public opinion that effects the thoughts of the adherents even today. Remember in the past the Catholic Church in many cases wiped out whole regions to keep a divergence view point from expressing itself. They were afraid others would be influenced by such variation hence losing control of the Church. To control the mind is to control the actions. . . As I have cited before a half a million Cathars were wiped out just to stop heretical ideas like the inclusivity of the feminine divine aspect and reincarnation. We all are influenced not only by our environment but also powerful historical moments. And those open enough to recognize it are given the opportunity to see things for how they really are.

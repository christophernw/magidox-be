Have you had any recent injury, changed your shoes (or have older shoes) or an insect bite?. It may be that  you had an injury and were favoring the leg and now the second leg hurts because of overuse. Are you a healthy weight? Extra weight causes strain on the joints.. Check your shoes. If they are not supporting you correctly, try to get some which fit better. From personal experience, shoes have been a major factor in leg and back pain for me.. Some insects carry diseases which cause joint pain.  This is probably not the case for you becasue it was one leg then the other.. Don't let this problem continue. If changing your shoes and massage does not help, try a different doctor if possible.

Scuse me? According to the 1st Amendment, It is illegal to ban the pledge of anything. It is also illegal to REQUIRE  anyone to take such a pledge. If you don't like it, start a drive to change the 1st  Amendment.. . So many people say untrue extreme things to get attention for their causes.. Prayer is not banned in schools; forced prayer is. Private expression of religious beliefs is not banned on  Government Property, but public support & expression is. . . I know we have a lot of inconsistencies in our country. If you want to know the reason the Constitution forbids the establishment of a state religion, read the history of the early settlers in this country. Short version: They came here to escape the persecution from the majority religion of their home countries. Once here, they displayed the same cruelty toward those who did not believe & practice their own narrow religious views. In both cases, the persecuting & most of the persecuted groups were all calling themselves Christians. Almost all Christian groups persecuted the Native Americans, Blacks, & Jews, each group of which its own faith. Most of the founding fathers were Christians who knew their history & did not want it repeated.. . Whether liberal or conservative, extremism hurts the cause. The difference? Until both sides moderate, I will continue to be a moderate leaning toward the side that offers all of us more freedom of choice, which is currently the liberals.

I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. aka Mormon, LDS... I was born into a very religious home and am so thankful for that. I have to say when I was young, I rode on the coat-tails of my parents' testimony.  But as I got older and read the Book of Mormon more, I developed my own testimony through many spiritual experiences. I was married in the temple for time and all eternity to my spouse and I am so grateful that our Heavenly Father provided a way for us to return to Him and live with our families forever!

If contacts are the right prescription for your eyes, the most common reason they would be blurry is they are not moistened enough. Ask your eyecare professional what drops would be best to use with the contacts you have. If I am at home, my favorite remedy is to use saline solution - it seems the most natural thing to be using. Otherwise, I carry Visine for contacts around with me for the same purpose.

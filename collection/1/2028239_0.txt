I think it is a good place - though, the people are too poor to have a lot of energy to be creative.  There are so many environmentally friendly ways of producing energy - and the Chinese so wise - I think soon they will allow their population to start to enjoy things - especially when they things like electric cars, pollution free appliances, ... when they decide to make things for themselves, instead of for the West... China has such possibilities.  Right now though, the people are too poor to have the creative aspect of their lives fulfilled.

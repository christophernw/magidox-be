Kerry makes a better gigolo than he does politician!  The fact is. he's not very bright, however he was smart enough to scam his way out of Vietnam with his three trumped up wounds that never required hospitalization.  And, he was politically connected enough, even back then, to apply enough political pressure on those who approved three Purple Hearts, which qualified him to leave the war zone and return home.. . His attempt at humor was a feeble attempt to discredit GWB.  Boy, talk about backfire, he couldn't have done himself more harm if he came out and said how much he hated GWB for beating him out of the presidency.   Well, he did it to himself, and this time, he's made himself a political leper.  . . His attempt at humor, at least the analogy he used, became obsolete when the draft ended.  So, unless it was intended only for GWB, he sure didn't think that one through.  . . It's now up to the liberals of Massachusetts to decide if Kerry stays or goes.  Then again, the swimmer still has his job!

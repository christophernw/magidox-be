"If your refering to the one thats in the front bumper it should be like this. As your looking at the light housing go to the side of it towards the grill. Look through the bumper holes and you'll see a white tube, inside of that is a phillips head screw. You'll need a long handled phillips for this, but thats all that holds them. Good luck ."

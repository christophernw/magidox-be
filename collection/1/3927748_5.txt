Christ on a single day (Good Friday) once for all made atonement for the sins of God’s people (Heb. 9:11–14).. . It's not a good thing that He died, but we sure need to be thankful that He did so to take our sins and to give us a free gift of righteousness before the Father. That's GOOD! Thank You, Lord Jesus.

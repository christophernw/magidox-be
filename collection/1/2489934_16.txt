heat ..bcuz transfer of heat from a body gives a feelin of colness& 2 that body( due to loss in kinetic energy).The body which receives heat feels hot(due to an increase in kinetic energy).......So undoubtedly strongest force is heat . .               BCUZ COLD IS A STATE WHEN HEAT IS NT AVAILABLE!!

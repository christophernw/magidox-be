I asked this Q a few days ago anf the guy in the link I gave u told me the following:. . "In a way, blood is "blue" before it's exposed to oxygen. Before the hemaglobin in blood picks up oxygen molecules, the blood is a dark purple color. When the hemaglobin (a protein molecule containing an iron complex called "heme") picks up the oxygen, it turns from dark gray-purple to bright red.. . The unoxygenated color lends a bluish-purple tone to lips when you are "cyanotic" or blue due to lack of oxygen. It's not a true blue like the sky, but it's a dark bluish purple."

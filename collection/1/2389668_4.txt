It is caused by the movement of large plates on the earth's crust.  When these plates move into each other it causes a collision, which basicallly push them together - hence the reason for all the Mountains out west - 2 plates pushed together caused the ends to go up...hence mountains...but when these plates move you get the shaking, thus causing an earthquake.

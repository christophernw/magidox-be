To be honest with you he isn't thinking much. Cats are very affectionate but this is for a reason. When he is affectionate it is a reaction to your interaction. Therefore it is then assumed that cats act in reaction to stimuli from within and out. Hunger causes a trigger to hunt or seek human help. A running mouse must be pursued for fun and so on.. . This theory has been proven, as I have read by putting electrodes on a cats head and then taking away external stimuli. The brain waves and activity slowed down to almost nothing - the minimum level to support bodily organs and functions... This may suggest that internal disturbances do not have an effect. I also think this is the reason why a cat may survive for months at sea without food and water shut in a dark container.. . A human on the otherhand in contrast would have the ability to generate thoughts independently in the same conditions. Left too long psychosis would set in.. . Now I love cats and I know how you feel ridiculed when mentioning the cats intellegence. Some cats know 25+ words and are more intellegent than others. My cat knows up, sit, drink and more from repitition and the reaction thing ie she gets a drink when she hears the word.

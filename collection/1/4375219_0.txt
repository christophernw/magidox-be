the CHRISTIAN understanding of fate is that fate doesnt exist. neither does good luck or bad luck. GOD is in control of everything and he answers all prayers. if something goes wrong its because that particular sistuation was not prayed about. example; u leave the house and get in a car wreck and now ur car is totaled and ur family has no transportation. it's not god's fault - he didn't LET this happen to u - YOU DIDNT pray for this to be prevented. if u had, god would've answered ur prayer and there would've been no car wreck. but the CHRISTIAN understanding is that FAITH exist - not fate, and not luck.

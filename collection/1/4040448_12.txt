You could say the same thing out the false prophet Mohammed, couldn't you?  Anyway, Bush is an idiot and I didn't vote for him, but at least in America you can vote for any idiot you want.  There are consequences, of course, but it beats a lot of those Muslim countries where men are afraid of women so they make them wear veils, they cut off our hands for stealing, bomb each other senseless because they have disagreements about religions, or best of all--suppress the human beings right to live free, instead giving that right to some pompous, bloated, dicktaster, uh, dictator.  Go ahead and keep your Iraq, your Iran, or your backward-ass Pakistan...that s*hit is for the birds.. . p.s.  Live free or die.  Get it?  That's why terrorism will never win.

You ask a wonderful question but you try to do it on an uneven level.  You ask for your responders to give some data to substantiate their assertions that global warming is just a democrat fantasy, but you offer no such data to support your claim that there truly is enough data to say that there is a thing such as "global warming".  Common courtesy in a discussion or debate is to enter the exchange with the data or proof to prove your point as you demand your opponents do.  And one or two numbers about and iceberg floating further south than any other one has in the past hundred years, for example, is nowhere near substantial enough data to respectfully enter into any type of intelligent debate, so, the way I've got it figured, by the wording of your question and accusations, you'll be doing some research for the next decade or so to maturely enter in any kind of intelligent debate on the subject you present.  Oh, and besides the environmental data you'll need to present to cover the last hundred years or so, you'll need to provide statistically reliable and valid data to support your claim that the Republicans don't believe in global warming and the democrats do.  See ya in a decade or so when you're prepared to intelligently discuss the matter.  God Bless you.

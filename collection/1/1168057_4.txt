wear them for a few days - without washing them. i know it sounds bad but it works. just try not to get them dirty. if u wash them everyday b 4 u wear them - then they will get back tight. but by allowing ur body to wear them without washing - ur body itself will stretch the jean. u could at least try it and c what im talking about - cuz its really does work!

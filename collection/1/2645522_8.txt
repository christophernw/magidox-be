Jesus died for our sins...he doesn't protect us. God does.... . 1) Just because you see someone in a priest suit, doesn't mean they are closer to God than me,  you, or anyone else.  That's a nasty stereotype that has been going on for years... it's more of internal issue.  . . 2) Bad things will happen to most of us at some point or another for reasons that I don't, because I'm not God.. . 3) Priest are supposed to be celibate on Catholic law, but why...? It's not in Bible for them to be, so and the Church a few centuries ago did not forbade Priest to marry, it only changed when a lot of young men started to into the church and work as Priest, 1300s.. . Still, that doesn't justify their actions.. . Celibacy (or going without sex for long periods of time) is pretty hard for anyone.  Most people would damn near lose their minds, if they didn't have any.  It's something need outside of shelther, food, water, and comfort.. . 4) God doesn't equal Priests, the priest work for God, and sometimes workers do not carry out his will or do the jobs that he wants them to do.

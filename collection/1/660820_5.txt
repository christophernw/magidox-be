Keeping track of your progress in a VERY SIMPLE TO USE diary, that lets you see how well you've done so far.. . Making it a family event and mixing things up so its not just dull working out every day, it becomes a lifestyle. Playing soccer with the kids for half an hour or taking a walk after dinner with your sweetie a few nights a week can help. If you make a "partnership" with a friend to commit to work out you can push eachother further and sit around at a lunch crabbing at what you don't like about it. Misery loves company. XD . . Pick a sport, martial art, or series of different workout videos you'll enjoy and WANT to go back to. Set a time limit and keep to it, but don't over do it or you'll get sick of it quickly. . . Pay attention to your body, if you're unusually sore one day, don't overdo and make it worse so your healing time takes a week or more!. . Reward yourself when you meet your goals! It doesn't have to be anything huge. A special healthy treat you only get when accomplish what you set out to do. A bubble bath. A massage to/from your sweetie. . . Realize that exercise begets energy, you'll feel much better once you get started, and even if you're blah about it, start for five minutes and you'll keep yourself going the whole time not thinking about it. . . Watch a movie or sing along and loud to your favourite music while working out.

Registered Nurse here; Dear your fine, the only thing that happens is your gastric juices in your stomach digest the gum like any other food item.  That's it, don't worry about it, be Happy, and have a GREAT THANKSGIVING!. OMG I just read some of the answers, honey, believe me the gum will be dissolved within a few hours.  Gastric juices can literally dissolve a nail.  That is if the gastric  juices are in a container and a nail put in the container within a month the nail is dissolved, this is an experiment we did when I was in graduate school.  The only danger gum imposes if you suck it or swallow it into your trachea and as with any other food item or non food item this can block your trachea and then if not dislodged via Heimlich maneuver one does die.

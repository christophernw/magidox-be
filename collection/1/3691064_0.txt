Other than checking bank balances, it would not be easy.

Can you go into a bookstore and pick out a great book based on the type of cover it has?  Imagine putting 100 people in a room, all dressed in jeans and t-shirts.  Could you pick out the poor ones without delving into each person's background individually? Not an easy task.

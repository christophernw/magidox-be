In the UK (sorry I don't know if you are from US or not), but anyway (!) in the UK, go to www.gazettes-online.co.uk, and click on 'The London Gazette'. This is the online version of the London Gazette, where all insolvencies (personal bankruptcy and corporate) have to be advertised.. . WHEN SEARCHING, it's best to use the advanced search and type in SURNAME, FIRSTNAME, (SMITH, FRED) if you type in FIRSTNAME then SURNAME (FRED SMITH) it will not come up with any hits (weird I know).  You should be able to search bankruptcy records for the last 7 years.. . Hope that helps

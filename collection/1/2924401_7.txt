Most ppl seem to be answering that its becuase the cat is sick, and this can be true. Grass does help them when they have an upset stomach. However, you can just buy grass for your cat to eat at Petco. Some cats really like eating grass. I'm not sure why but it doesnt always mean they are sick. I have a cat that everytime I take her for a walk, she eats grass but doesnt puke... she just likes it.

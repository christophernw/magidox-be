our emotions are a factor in our 'logic', our idea of logic is based a lot on what our emotions tell us.  Example: if your angry how is your logic effected? or when you sad, etc..  What we consider as right and logically is derived from the emotions we feel on that subject.  To me its logically to give the death sentence to rapists, because jail isn't enough, but thats me because I have strong emotions against rape.

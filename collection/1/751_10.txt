This comes from the legal profession giving the wrong interpretation of the 1st amendment.  If you read it correctly, the restraint is on the State to leave the churches alone.  No mention is made of saying the Churches cannot partake in politics.  The founders just wanted to be sure there would not be a State Religion to which all must belong and support.

if you think of what a pizza looks like. it has a crust and cheese and then they put the pepperonis on it..so now you see cheese and a space and then pepperoni..and the heat gets to escape form the cheese into the air..the cooling effect of convection.... now the area with the pepperonis is hotter because the heat cannot escape as fast and the cheese stays a lot hotter under the pepperonis.... so now you all know the basic reason and not the scientific reason for the burning of the roof of your mouth from the pepperonis... be careful, because this phenomenon will happen again and again. Good luck

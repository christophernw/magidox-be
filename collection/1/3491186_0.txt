You cannot remove your e-mail address from someone elses adress book, but you can block someone from e-mailing you. Go to your mail account, then select options at the far right. Then under spam at the bottom there is a block adresses section go there and type the persons adress you want to block. If you are just looking to get rid of spam, in the options section there is a way to set it so when you mark mail as spam, it delets it and adds the adress to the block adress list so you never get an e-mail from that adress again.

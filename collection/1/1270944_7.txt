Never. Let's say we let the terrorists take over the world. Someone is still going to want to believe they way they want, live the way they want and have a say in who their leader is. The new leaders won't be going for that. Someone will get mad because their buddy got executed for something we're used to being able to do because we used to be free. Someone will organize a takeover and there will be war once again.

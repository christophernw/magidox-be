Muslims think for the sake of thier comunity not the individuals who live in it..so it is like any other relegion trying to spread..the only emperical difference from christianity is that women cover thier heads..and that is as i see it the only reason we look at it in a bad way.. if islam was less conservative.. i think it would already conquered the world.

It depends on the type of injury.  Although veterinary medicine has come a long way and now that is not the only option, a severe fracture can be very difficult to treat.  Repairing the fracture is possible, but many horses die from complications due to infection.  I live in an area where there is a vet school, and even the university clinic will not repair very severe fractures in most cases.

This is soooooooooooooooooooo easy.  Just sit down with a pad and pencil or pen and write down all of the things that you want but have as yet to buy for yourself.  Just make sure that you don't go do any shopping for yourself around this time of the year so your friends and family with have something to get you that you really would like to have or if you have people in your life that are practical tell them what it is that you need.

Whatever oxygen that is left after the body has received its share (after the blood has become venous) will not be used. It is just a reserve that the body has for emergencies. For example, if you suddenly have an asthmatic attack and cannot oxygenate your blood as well as before, the percentage oxygen remaining will become less, but your body will still be able to function well due to this reserve. Another example of our reserves are the kidneys - we don't really need two kidneys to survive.

My Mom used to mix some flour with the cinnamon and sugar she sprinkled over the apples when making apple pie, if she felt the apples were too juicy, and might make the pie runny.. . Maybe this would work with peaches, too? Mix the sugar, cinnamon, whatever you coat the peaches with, with some flour, toss to coat.. . You could probably use cornstarch, too.. . Hope this helps.  :-))

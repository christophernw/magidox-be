Ive said it before and I'll say it again, immigrants are not citizens and do not have the same (as many) rights as citizens. I know for a fact they are not allowed to carry concealed weapons! So... they are either naturalized citizens or they are breaking the law. As far as buying property, no harm, no foul.

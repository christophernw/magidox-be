Mr. Neely. He was my 8th grade history teacher. He was a racist, lazy idiot. Fortunately, my friend and I prevented him from teaching history again. . . He ACTUALLY told us that all Asian people hide their money in their mattresses! No lie. That's just one of the completely rediculous lies he told us. . . AND, he never read our homework, he just stamped it without looking at it. So, halfway through the school year I started writing gibberish on my homework and turning it in. I totally got an A in his class! Idiot!

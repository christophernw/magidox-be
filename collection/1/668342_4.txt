When exercising, you are using muscles.  When you lift weights, you are straining the tissues, actually breaking the muscle fiber chains.  If you are sore, you feel that effect greatly from a hard workout the day before.  When you do excercise, especially with weights or strenuously, it will take more than 24 hours for those muscle fibers to regrow into stronger filaments.  When you run only, think of the heart, lungs, legs, shoulder all as muscles you are temporarily rendering weaker only to come out as stronger fibers.  Working out everyday will diminish your goals, and lead to possible repetitive stress injuries, ligament damage, etc.  Suggestion: work different muscle groups every other day, and you can hit the gym 7 per week. P.S.  You can do cardio each day, but suggest running one day, and swimming the next.

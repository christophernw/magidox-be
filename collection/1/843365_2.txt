You could try to estimate how many worms there are under the schools football field.. . Make a "wooden square" 1 yard by 1 yard out of four sticks, throw it randomly on the field, say, five or ten times.  Each time sprinkle a watering can full of water with a little formaldehyde in it over the are inside the square (this will make the worms come out), then calculate how many worms there probably are under the field by figuring out how many square yards the whole field is and doing the math.... . Maybe you could do your yard, too, and figure out if worms like yards or football fields best!

Given the posts I have read here.If the east and west coasts were wiped out the country would be better off.. The majority that answered your question are overly protected little brats that can not think past themselves and if they are what America is going to be,I might become a terrorist.. We would first have to tend to the damage and containment issues.We would then make assessments as to who and how.We would retaliate no matter who was in office.We would have to to prevent another devastating attack.More that likely with missiles and carpet bombing,as most of our reserves would be busy here enforcing marshal law to keep all those good little libs from robbing everyone blind.

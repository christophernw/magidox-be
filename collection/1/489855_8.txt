The practice of praying to Mary is entirely unbiblical, and Catholics claim that it is like asking someone on earth to pray for you - an intercessory prayer. The problem with this, though, is that first that Paul and other believers of his time asked others to pray for them, but there are never any requests made to people in Heaven to pray for them. The Bible gives absolutely no indication that Mary or any of the saints can hear our prayers, they are not omniscient. Whenever the Bible mentions praying to or speaking with the dead, it is in the context of sorcery, witchcraft, and divination - activities the Bible strongly condemns (Leviticus 20:27; Deuteronomy 18:10-13). The one instance when a "saint" is spoken to, Samuel in 1 Samuel 28:7-19, Samuel was not exactly happy to be disturbed.. . The thing is, by praying to Mary, they are essentially downplaying Christ's role as our intercessor. I'll give an example from Old Testaments times to make some sense here:. . What Catholics are doing could be likened to an Israeli asking a friend to make a request to God for him instead of coming to the high priest. What we do, asking others on earth to pray for us, is like an Israeli asking a friend to come to the high priest to communicate his request to God, it expresses that the request is more urgent. This is the kind of mediation Christ is responsible for.

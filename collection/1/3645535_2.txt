Fibonnaci was a very clever person, who came up with Fibonnaci numbers. It's a series of numbers like so:. 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,... You add the previous two numbers to get the next. The special thing is when you divide one number by the previous one. The bigger the numbers of the squence you use the closer to get to the number 0Â·61803...  which is a really special ratio. . . It turns up all over the place in nature. E.g. pine cones, the pattern of the ridges on a pineapple skin and in the spiral of a shell. Also, if you draw a selection of rectangles of different proportions and ask people which is the most beautiful they will say the one whose sides come cloests to the 'Golden ratio' without even knowing about the ratio.. . Anyway, google 'fibonnaci + biography' and you will find lots of stuff about him and the other maths things he did.

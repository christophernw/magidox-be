well id say leg press honestly but im not a running person, anything that will increase your leg strength yet not build too much muscle to wear your legs would be come heavier.. . . infact, my dad once had ankle weights when i was a child and i would wear them because i was a kid and you know bored... but the added weight will obviously make you stronger and probably run faster at the same rate. also if the werent extremely bulky you could bike with them for long distances. if you can diet and build muscle in your legs you should be faster.

Broadly speaking, there has always been a distinction made between learning/dissemination of information done in a controlled, formal setting (like a classroom, scientific laboratory, even a TV news studio) and that done by means of going TO the subject under study (whether it's a breaking news story, an archaeological dig, or an interesting ecosystem).. In news reports, they speak of "reporters in the field" to distinguish them from the anchors in the studio.. I would guess the phrase might date to Linnaeus' time... the famous biologist who would gather samples of different plant species literally from the field (in the meantime studying their habitat etc) and, back in his laboratory, painstakingly catalogue the phenotypic differences and attempt to classify each plant by how closely it appeared to be related to others.. Any excursion made in this manner, to gather information at the source, eventually became commonly described as a field trip, even though it may not necessarily involve an actual field.

Have you ever noticed that the fast food places tend to be more prevalent in poorer areas.  Lets say you are really hungry. Lets say you only have a dollar.  What are you going to buy, a double cheeseburger from Mcdonalds or an Orange from the grocery store.  Most people would tend to go with the Mcdonalds because it is more likely to fill you up.  So really isn't an issue of lazyness,or convenience but one of economics.

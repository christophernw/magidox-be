Because Christmas is a part of culture more than religion.  Most people know that it wasn't originally Christian anyway. (Pagan roots, again.)  And let's face it, winter is bleak in the north.  If you don't have something to look forward to, you're going to go nuts.  And it's fun, all the decorating and food and candy.  You don't need to be religious to appreciate it.

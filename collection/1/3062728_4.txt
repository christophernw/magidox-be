Different species,evolve differently and we are a different specie than apes.The apes are evolving too it takes longer than the human eye can see in large animals.Small creatures can be observed under a microscope in there process of evaluation and your own cells as well.You can also observe evolution in your own body when you catch a cold you will never catch the same virus again because you have built up a resistance to it.When you get a sun tan your body is changing to adjust to the increased exposure by changing to a deeper color.I really wish you could expand your mind and try to believe with all the beauty in nature why would god choose to be in the image of man and the evil things we do to everything.  Good Luck!

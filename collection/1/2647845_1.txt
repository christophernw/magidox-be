Is it running the same as when the key is on or is it chugging and making weird noises?. If it is running like normal, then it could be a malfunction in the ignition switch not cutting power to the engine ignition(spark).. If is is running weird like chugging and backfireing, then that is called "dieseling" and can be caused by excessive carbon build up in the compustion chamber thus igniting the fuel without the use if a spark. It could have other causes such as a faulty knock sensor, idel stop solenoid, or air cleaner temperature sensor so the best thing to do is get it tuned up and checked over by a trustworthy mechanic.

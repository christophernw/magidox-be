1. Dead Frickin Rising. 2. Gears of War. 3. Halo 2 runs fine on the 360, and the public beta of Halo 3 multiuser is coming. 4. Oblivion on PS3 got postponed, did not make it to the PS3 launch list. 5. I can connect my iPod to my 360 and listen to my music while playing (I honestly don't know if this can be done in a PS3). 6. I can pull music, pictures and video off my iMac G5 into the 360 media area, all it took was a $20 shareware app.. 7. XBL is idiot proof. It just works.. 8. I did not have to camp out to get my 360. I drove to the store, picked the 360, the games I wanted and calmly pushed my cart to the register. Time spent at the store? Less than 15 minutes.. 9. My wife is a degenerate flash game addict. Most of those games are on XBL Arcade, and dirt cheap. That means she gets to play Xbox instead of bitching about ME playing.. 10. XBL always lets me know when my friends are connected so it is easy to holler and get a game together.

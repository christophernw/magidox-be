the birth control pill actually has a side effect for some people of enlarging their breasts.  however, if you are still very thing it's going to take a while for your breasts to get to anywhere near thier original size.   they may never be the size they were before your disorder.  i've also heard of herbla supplements that are supposed to enlarge breasts, though i wouldn't know how effective they are.

It's hard to say. I know when you wake up in the morning your blood pressure raises rapidly. This could be the reason for the headaches. If this problem persists I would tell your family physician. There are many things that can trigger this. For instance, if you smoke, if you drink a lot of caffeine, etc etc. It's best to be checked out by a skilled physician. I hope this helps!

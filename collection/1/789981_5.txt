people who arent asain seem to have some strange obsession with asain culture. i guess thats flattering but its kind of funny too since most of the time they dont know whats going on and try to fit in with what is going on. im asian but not chinese or japanese so i would check with chinese/japanese people i KNOW i can READ chinese or japanese if i were gonna get an asain tattoo. or else im pretty sure my tattoo is gonna say something like "im stupid" and all the chinese/japanese people will be laughing at me.

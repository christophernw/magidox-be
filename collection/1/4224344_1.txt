Good question!  . . However, the question is not exceptionally clear.. . To me, it seems the question is:  Science shows there is no such thing as free will.  If humans don't have free will, why discuss morality and in particular, why discuss agency?. . And if that is the question, it begins with a false assumption:  That Humans do not have free will.. . And you provide your answer:  Man with out free will + intelligence cannot ask a question on yahoo answers, nor can he ask a question about free will, nor could he invent the program yahoo!answers.. . Man is intelligent (i.e. rational) and has free will.  If we did not have these things, we could not fight for the freedom to live as we please, we could not create art or music, and we would never think of or desire to play sports.  Science itself is an endeaver freely entered upon and requires intelligence.. . Not intended to answer the question as asked, but only to show that it is not clear Man is not free.  Man being free has moral responsibility for his actions.. . One other responce:  suppose you have a laptop computer, and I take it from you without asking for it.  I steal it from you.  You know you have been robbed, and that what I have done is wrong.  (let's assume that I am fairly normal person, i.e. I know what I am doing, and that no one forced me to do it-- no one else is holding a gun to my head or holding my family hostage, etc).  Same too, no one says, oh, Hitler, he did not have a choice, there was no freedom involved in his actions, he was just like anyone else.. . Once again, just showing that common sense tells us, and rightly so, that man does have freedom.. . Peace be with you.

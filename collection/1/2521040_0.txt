When I took my ball to the vet, the doc opened his mouth (the snake's, not his own) by pulling under the chin. There was a lot of loose skin though, so my assumption is that the slit is actually folded skin so that the animal's head is streamline unless it's eating, when it has to expand it's mouth. Does this make any sense?

He'd fight it differently. In World War II, Patton was known for confounding both US strategists & the enemy by doing the unexpected. Some thought he took a lot of risks, but he lost less men than any other General in that war. He was a military genius who would analyze the situation and take what he thought the appropriate action -it usually worked well. Unfortunately, he's not around to analyze the present military landscape.

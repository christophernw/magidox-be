I live in a place that you do not have to buy box turtles.  They roam wild everywhere.  I used to have a couple of them that I kept in a pen outside.  In the winter they would dig down in the dirt and hibernate and in the spring they would come up again.  Me and my kids loved to play with them.. . Anyway, I read somewhere that they loved bread and milk.  So, I tried it.  That ended up being my turtles favorite food.  Just break up the bread and pour milk on it. I think the calcium in the milk helped keep their shells in good shape too. I also gave them raw hamburger.  They really liked that alot also.

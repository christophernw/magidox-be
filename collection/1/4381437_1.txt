The body is healing and building itself while you are asleep, and it happens to most men. It's a good thing, and very impressive when you're married. (Wow, my hubby get's it up for me first thing in the morning! What a guy!) But the truth is, it's just your body healing and building itself. And, yes, it's a good thing for that stuff to work down there like that! :)

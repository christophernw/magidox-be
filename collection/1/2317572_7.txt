Depends on the Whiskey or Whisky. Sometimes I feel that people drink a low class of whiskey and say they like it because they cannot effort better whiskey. Some people like a alcoholic sharp taste, some are just drinking because of the effect of drinking. However some are really whiskey lovers and know that a malt whiskey or good blended whiskey is like the best to enjoy smoothly

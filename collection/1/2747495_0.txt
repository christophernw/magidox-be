Pain = something is wrong.  If you haven't seen a doctor, go see a doctor.  Don't ask people for medical advice on Yahoo (or any other message board or website).  You'll get some very inaccurate information and there's NO possible way that they can give you a good answer, even if they are a doctor, because you need to be examined.

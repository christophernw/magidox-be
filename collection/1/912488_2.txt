They don't have to.. I don't like tight underwear, it gives the pressure to my testicles, I don't feel comfort. In other case, tight underwear would make the temperature around your genital higher because the scrotum isn't able to loose itself (hangs lower) by the tight underwear and it's not good for your sperm, less producing and high sperm mortality.

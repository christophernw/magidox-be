It might not be that serious, but I'd go see a dentist just in case. . . It could be many things... your enamel might be a little bit weak, it might be a cavity, you might have inflamed gums, or it could be... *drums rolls* a mental thing. My nerves get really sensitive when I think they "hurt". I was convinced my teeth were getting "weaker" until I went to the dentist and he verified that it was because I kept thinking about it too much. After him telling me that, they don't hurt all that bad anymore.. . Go to the dentist, start flossing, and use Sensidyne if it's really that bad. Goodluck. :)

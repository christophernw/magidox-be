Here's the way it works in Florida:. . Occasionally a landlord will have to evict a tenant.  The landlord must provide written notice to the tenant that the landlord is demanding possession of the unit.  If the tenant fails to vacate the premises within 3 days (if eviction is for failure to pay rent, 7 days for all other reasons), the landlord must file a complaint in the County Court.. . After the case is heard, the landlord will receive a final judgement.  The landlord must then obtain a writ of possession, authorizing the sheriff to remove the tenant.  The sheriff will give the tenant 24 hours notice prior to physically evicting the tenant.

The way I use to tint auto glass years ago was 1) make sure you buy the right color , width, and length for what you are trying to tint. 2) Clean all the surface off real good with vinegar and a news paper that way it has nothing on the windows 3) make sure you have a squeegee to get all the air bubbles out. start from the middle to the outside. 4) make sure you have your tint cut out to the right amount you will need before putting it on the surface. 5)spray with windex and apply tint. make sure to get all air bubbles out with the squeegee.  Do not try to lift after applying .

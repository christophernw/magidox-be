Abortion is a very difficult subject. Its easy for people to say " Oh I would never abort a child!" I must add that it really depends on the individual situation.  You cannot know how difficult it is unless you are faced with making this decision. I used to be extremely against it. I used to get really heated when talking about how messed up the people were that had them.. .  Now though I have been through a similar situation where my partner and I were faced with a very difficult choice.  I am grateful we never had to make it.(it was made for us naturally) but since then I do not judge those who have them as we as outsider can not possibly know or understand what that person is really going through. There are case where is it understandable. The mother needs and health should be considered. Although I hope you never have to make such a decision.. . Peace to all life.

Depends,   it  is  situational  ?   Like  the  death  of  a  loved  one  or  you  recently  became  disabled   or   work  in  your  chosen  career   is  disappearing ?     Meds  won't  change  reality,  although  they  could  give  you  a  temporary  lift,  kind  of  like  jump starting  a  car  when  the  battery  is  low.    We  have  to  learn  to  accept  life's  changes.. But   if  you  are  depressed  &  don  NOT  know  why,  then  maybe  you  have  a  dietary  deficiency  or  exposure  to  toxic  chemicals  or  something  else.. Resolution  of  depression   is  a  wideeeee  topic  and  you   didn't   really  provide  enough  info  for  a  good  response.

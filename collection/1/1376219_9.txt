a couple of suggestions might help:. . 1.  mix a little self-rising flour and butter in with the mashed potatoes.. . 2.  bake like normal except for the last few minutes.  then, broil for a few minutes -- keep an eye on it though.. . 3.  After doing 1 and 2, top with a mixture of cheddar and monterey pepper jack cheese, and broil some more.. . good luck.. . http://www.connexion.org/mybigbear_ron. http://www.myspace.com/mybigbear_ron. http://www.guys4men.com/members/444764/. http://360.yahoo.com/mybigbear_ron. http://www.fabuloush.com/viewprofile.asp?vid=15084. http://www.blogger.com/profile/11305627

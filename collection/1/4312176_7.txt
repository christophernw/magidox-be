If there is news worthy general interest in the story or it has unusual details then it gets national attention, such as the Natalie Holloway story. It is a mystery what happened to a very pretty young lady in a tropical island resort.. It has to be a mystery, hopefully with a beautiful young woman who vanished, white of course. There has to be a villanous suspect, and a family that really cares and is vocal and has some money.

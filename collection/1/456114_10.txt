Basically there was loads of rock and gas in one place, then there were a series of explosions (Singularities) but i wont go int them, it is far too complicated for most to understand, then there was a chain reactiuon and every exploded out in all directions, but here is the REAL question, what does it explode into if the universe was created by it and the universe is every thing?

I'm an African American Male from the Midwest. It's rare to see them around here but whenever I travel to the Delta they are on the bumper of every truck, and you can buy a ball-cap with a flag at every gas station. I really don't take offense to them because some people sport them because of family heritage, after all it does represent a part of American history. On the other hand some hard core Confederates didn't want the abolition of slavery, and had they had there way America as we know it could have turned out much differently to say the least.  So yes, I can see why Confederate flag waving people could scare you. I like tend to think that whosoever is flying it is not for the purpose of race inequality

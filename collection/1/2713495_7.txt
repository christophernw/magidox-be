Okay. The religious leaders at the time were really intimidated by his teachings and thought he was overriding their own teachings... and he was also treading on the toes of the politicians and the tax collectors by talking about these kinds of things. They were worried about a revolt.. But they had no legal leg to stand on, and this is what Pontius Pilate's speech is about where he literally washes his hands of it.. . The Bible talks about Jesus being free of sin or wrongdoing, which would have meant that Jesus hadn't done anything wrong, and a Christian would believe that Jesus was the equivalent of a sacrificial offering, like the Jews used to make on a regular basis up until that time, to cleanse or expunge themselves of their sins.. . I hope this helps.

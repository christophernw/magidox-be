The way I have trained my cats to stop scratching furniture is to always have a spray bottle of water handy. When you see the cat heading towards the couch just spray the water in the direction of the cat. The water doesn't have to hit the cat for the result to be apparent. Also buy or make a scratching post for the cat, either with carpet or wrap a pole with nice smelling natural jute rope (about 1cm 1/2inch in dia), my cat just loves her jute scratching post. Also every time the cat goes near the couch, pick her up and gently place his/her claws on the scratching post and give lots of pats for rewards. The cat will soon get the idea. Cats can be trained, but I would not go to the extreme of de-clawing. Find the cat another good home if that is the case.

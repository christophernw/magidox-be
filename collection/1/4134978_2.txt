The plane that launched the torpedo wasn't a P-3 it was a TU-95 bear F anti submarine plane and said so in the movie. This plane fired it's torpedo at the red october to prevent it from defecting to the US. Watch it again and pay attention to the subtitles and the light shall shine upon your befuddled brain.

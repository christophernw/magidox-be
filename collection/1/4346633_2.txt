I think you did not understand the book "The War Prayer".. . In the book, a church full of people are praying for victory in war.  A lone figure shows them that while they are praying for victory, they are also praying for the destruction and slaughter of others.. . The book was not about religion being used to justify war.  It was about being aware of what you are praying for.  Instead of praying for victory for our troops in time of war, we should be praying for peace and an end to the war.. . Written by Mark Twain during the Philippine-American War in the first decade of the twentieth century, The War Prayer tells of a patriotic church service held to send the town's young men off to war. During the service, a stranger enters and addresses the gathering. He tells the patriotic crowd that their prayers for victory are double-edged-by praying for victory they are also praying for the destruction of the enemy... for the destruction of human life.

Not all -Jehovah's Witnesses reecognise that God has a name and that the word "God" is only a title like King or Lord.. The New World Translation Bible that we use also has had Jehovahs name put back where it belongs (in the hebrew scriptures the name Jehovah appears nearly 7000!). And as one of Jehovahs Witnesses,I do what the name implies-go and talk to people about our great God and his purpose for mankind. Its funny how people have been deceived to think that God could possibly be a name.Even Jesus when taught his disciples to pray at Mat 6:9 said "Our Father in the heavens,let your NAME be santified" and yet many recite this prayer without giving any consideration to its meaning.. People have names for their pets,their children,each other and yet somehow they dont feet it important or necessary for the Creator of all things to have a personal name!. I just need to add that Gravtol is just a little off the mark - the ancient jews became superstitious in relation to the command not to use the name of your God in vain so to be on the safe side they stopped using it altogether!Which not what our Heavenly Father wanted or wants.How can you develop a relationship with someone when you dont know their name-Thats not showing respect that is being ignorant

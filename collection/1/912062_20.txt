To repent is to change your mind about something. the mind and will is really decided about something,most especially about SIN. but since we're just imperfect people, we're sure to slip now and then, especially at the start. but if we're really serious about something we're decided about-through the Holy Spirit, we'll have power to overcome that.. hope this helps.. helpmeets. http://mwfrc.blogspot.com

dogs have very good ears,he can hear 10 times better than we can.. they could hear the neighbors car door shut, or even bark at things on t.v.(my dog always barks at noises when I'm watching t.v.) yes,it does get annoying,but i would rather have a dog bark at stupid stuff,than to not bark at all!!!!

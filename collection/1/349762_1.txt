As we grow up, we change our tastes a bit. How we dress, how we style our hair, do makeup, etc., so it makes sense that our taste in friends and spouses will change too.  Some people make it when married early, but they have to both be special people with a desire to make the marriage work.  This takes sacrifice of self, something young people aren't great at.

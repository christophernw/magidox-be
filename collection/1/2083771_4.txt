A dog hates to pee in it's living area! But when they have to go they gotta go. Keep your puppy in its kennel when you can not watch her. Right away once you get here out of her kennel, TAKE HER POTTY! The best thing for a puppy is to develop a routine. It will reassure her that she is loved and can teach her body when it hold it. Take her out at the most every 2 hours.

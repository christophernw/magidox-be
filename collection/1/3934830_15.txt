If your real anger is targeted at the fact that if this particular religion has some credibility, then how is it that it just believes animals are here, die, and then that's it, then here is a possible explanation.   There are branches of Christianity who do believe that animals have souls. Just not human ones. They (these souls) aren't interchangeable or morphous as in some Eastern religions. But as such, these branches do believe animals exist in the next life. Not to be trivial, but you will see Rover again one day.

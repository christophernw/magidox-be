I see by the answers you have got so far that the overwhelming majority of your answerer's completely missed the point, as per bloody usual.  You might have used an incorrect spelling but as a questioner you were correct in as much as you did ask a question.  Most of your answerer's were incorrect, they might have been clever with their comments but they did not actually answer the question.  What use is an answerer who does not answer?  I think they are the ones who are thick.. . The answer to your question is that language evolves and changes to meet the needs of the various social or demigraphic groups who use it.

Actually they don't have "breasts" exactly they just call it that because they don't know another term fo it. If they have it even the male chikens (roosters) have them. Another thing; they don't have nipples because they are not mammals, therefor they don't have mammary glands which produce milk to nurse their offsprings with. And since they don't have any use for it, they don't have it...

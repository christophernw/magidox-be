We have a democracy in Britain, and, rightly or wrongly, enough Labour MP's were elected for Tony Blair to form a Government.. . Unless there is a major rebellion by Labour MPs against Tony Blair (or lots of Labour MPs die or resign from Parliament and Labour lose the by-elections), then he will stay in office until he decides to go (He has said that he will step down as leader before the next general election), or dies.

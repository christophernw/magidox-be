It is because Meditation attempts to tap into your very soul. It deals with the life force inside you, the goal is to open the "symbolic third eye" but one should only attempt that when one is emotionally stable, by which you have addressed the most painful issues in your entire life.. Successful meditation will open a flood gate of emotions.. . . Engery leaks out the body when Mediation is not done right. The goal of certain types is to cycle the engery witout escaping throughout the seven centers. Sleepyness happens because of engery escaping or bad concentration.

We (catholic church)have a world youth movement it is called NET National evangelization team...young people evangelizing the youth...it is having phenomenal success all over the world. At world youth day there were 500,000 youth...and the youth are telling us they want to hear the truth and they want rules and boundaries and reasons to behave well....they are responding to conservative values and are having a blast doing it.

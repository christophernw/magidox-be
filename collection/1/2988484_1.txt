Well I have the same problem every time I kneel down my knees make this loud crack noise, well I looked into it and there is a pill called glucosamine. You can pick it up just about anywhere (even Walmart) this pill will help restore the fluid in my joints and will help to stop the cracking. This pill is not for everyone, it works good for my mom and dad but it made me sick to my stomach, but that is 2 out of 3 so give it a try and see if it works for you.

My dad had really high blood pressure!  You shouldn't smoke, exercise more, decrease cholesterol in your body!  Don't drink as much alcohol!  Everything you do is fine just the KEY is MODERATION!  What I suggest the most is exercise 4 times a week where you do it for 30-60 mins!  or do something that will break a sweat and just decrease your cholesterol intake!  Best of Luck!

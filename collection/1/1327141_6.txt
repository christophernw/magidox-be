Steve Saleen converts v6 mustangs and soups them up here in Irvine. Has been doing it for years. If you like eye candy in a Mustang this is it. For the amount of money they charge there is a lot of other better cars out there unless you like Mustangs this much. I have also heard a lot of horror stories of poor build quality etc. With the 2003-4 SVT Cobras and the new 500 hp GT500 you get a whole lot more bang for your buck than what a Saleen Mustang would ever give you.

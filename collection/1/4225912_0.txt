Some are cast in a mold where most steel wheels are made on a machine and then the two halves are welded together. Aluminum wheels are ususally put in a drilling machine and the machine will cut the wheel from a block of aluminum. Or, molten aluminum is pored into a mold, allowed to cool and them removed. Steel wheels can also be manufactured while using a drilling machine as wheel.

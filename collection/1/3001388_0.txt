If you come from Mexico you may have to wait your whole life after you apply.  If you have money to bribe mexiacan officials, you can make the process go faster, but there are quotas and tens of millions who want to come.  So people think, shoud I go across and risk arrest, or let my kids live in awful poverty for the next 10-20 years?  Obviously the choice is not too hard.

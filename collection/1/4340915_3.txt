It all depends on how much the station paid for a barrell of gas and then they need to turn around and make a profit so if they sold the gas below the price they made it would mean they are loosing profits, so they have to price it above so they inturn make a profit. Also if the store if privately owned they can set the price to be anything, and the price can be different on account of the sales of last month and if they did not meet their quota.

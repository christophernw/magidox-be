The Universe is dimensionless, that is, it has no boundaries that we know of.  The Universe is thought to have been created approximately 13 billion years ago.  NASA has a lot of information about the Universe and the many galaxies within it.  Go to http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/ for more information.  Good luck!

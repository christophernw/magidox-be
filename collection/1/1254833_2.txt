The Greeks were original thinkers; the Roman culture was almost all derivative of the Greek culture.  That's why you see a Greek and a Latin name for all of the gods and goddesses; the Romans had the same stories, adopted from the Greeks.  The Greeks were much more cultured, whereas the Romans were mostly warriors.

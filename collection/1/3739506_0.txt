Islam was founded by Nabi Muhammad saw when he received word from Allah in a prophecy. He began life in Mecca where idolatory was a main fact of life but had to flee to Madinah to escape prosecution in what has come to be known as the Hijrah. Islam spread through his family and friends at first but later his companions known as sahabat continued his work by a number of successful conquests which spread Islam to most of the middle east. Islam reached it high point when Muhammad and his army from Madinah conquered Mecca which was later deemed to the the Holy City.

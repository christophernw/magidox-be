*Sighing sadly for I have seen one or more canine die from this* Not fun and my empathy if you lost a dog to it.... . Far as isolation times, Parvo can live up to 7 months and if you live in an area with a high infection rate, you might wanna NEVER STOP the bleach treatments!. . This is a section from the 1st link below, worth reading in full.... . If you have had parvo in your home, use the bleach and water solution to kill it. Parvo can live up to seven months, or longer, in your home or yard. Before bringing home another dog, be certain it has a strong immunity built up to parvo. Have your veterinarian draw blood and run a titre to confirm how well your prospective dog will fare in a parvo-infected environment.. . Wish you the best of luck in this...

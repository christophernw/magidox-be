Another reason is that reputable breeders simply will not sell pups for Christmas.  Even if the pup is for yourself, it's just too hectic a time.  Also, most people who buy a pup "for Christmas" are ONLY thinking of Christmas, and not thinking about the long-term 10+ year commitment that a puppy (and the dog it becomes) involves.  So any pup you are able to buy "for Christmas" is coming from a breeder that cares more about making a sale than the welfare of their puppies.  Wait until after Christmas when things have settled back to your normal routine.

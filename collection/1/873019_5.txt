It really depends on the type of pain you have..If it is bone, sleeping with a small coushion or pillow between your knees is best, this also helps with muscle strain.. If you have not done anything for injury, then you may want to see a Dr. If you are over 30, a regular dose 3 times a day of ibuprofen will get a build up in your system and be very effective!

MMMM....well.....probably for the same reason those that want to spit in others faces don't have the same "rights" as those that don't.     . . It's not the spit itself it's the spitting in an others face that's the problem, just like I don't want your smoke in my lungs, but, I could care less if you smoke or even if those around you are OK with your smoking then by all means go ahead, it's when smokers take that right away from me and basically say I'm OK with smoking so you have to be OK with inhaling my smoke.

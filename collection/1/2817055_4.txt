The only guess I can make is that when you were having the sleep apnea, you weren't sleeping as deeply, hence your body sensed everytime you had to urinate. Now that you are sleeping more deeply, you are probably just not noticing that you have to go as frequently. Like I said, just a guess.. As a side note: frequent urination at night (nocturia) can be a sign of health problems (diabetes, prostate problems, etc.) so you might want to let your PCP know about this symptom.

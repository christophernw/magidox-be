Its a hypothetical question .. we would for sure know even before 8 Min. and that is because the star patterns will start changing as soon as earth is attracted by other havenly body after sun dissappears.. Now a days the terrestrial telescopes are constantly on look any new ar changed pattern is immediaty sent for automaticaly by the telescope to ist neighbouring telescope after varing with the inbult star catalogue. The set of telescopes will jointly observe and finally caution astronomers. So any change in star patterns we will immediately know within seconds. And if thre is no sun ,for sure there is  going to be change in star patterns.

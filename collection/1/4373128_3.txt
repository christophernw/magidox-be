sorry but there is nothing you can do or buy that will heal canker sores any faster, technically doctors dont even know what causes them, some believe it is stress and they call them mouth ulsures, some think it is diet or hygein related and they call them oral infections. best thing you cann do is get some mouth numbing stuff like Kanka and just ride it out, it will take about 10-14 days to heal. i know cause i recently had a very bad out break myself and had to go to the doctor. if it worsens then go to the docctor and he could put you on some antibiotics but it wont make it heal faster.

If the flower is pink then the darker areas of the flower would a be a very dark shad eof pink and the light areas very pale tinits of pink. Also use light and dark shades of other colour that are in there as well. But u will need the white cuz ther will be parts that pure light will hit and no matter what teh colour once light hits it the spot is seen as white.

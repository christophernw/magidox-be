The color of your teeth depends on a lot of things. If your teeth were naturally white before the actual treatment, then all you need to do is make sure that all the "glue" that was used for the braces is off by getting an ultrasonic scaling done. You can then use a whitening strip to lightly bleach your teeth, although this is recommended after a few weeks to ensure harder tooth structure which will endure the bleaching. You can also go in for a professional "in-office" bleach. Talk to your dentist about it.

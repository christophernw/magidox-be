Moving the plant outside is a sign of utter defeat.  Not all plants hang well.. . If you want to keep the feline out of the soil, cut a circle of window screen or 1/4 inch wire mesh.  Then cut a radius to the center and a hole for the plant stem.  Twist the circle, put in place and lower into the pot.. . If you want to keep kitty from playing with the plant itself, grow alfalfa in a shallow tray for the cat to nibble.  Place this on the floor near the food and water dishes.  You can also just buy "sprouts" at the grocery store (avoid a heavy radish mix).. . The last resort:  reload more often.  **grin**

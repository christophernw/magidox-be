Someone beat me to the punch...my first reaction was:  There is no such thing as a stupid question.  Anything that gets people talking and communicating is a good thing.  Why do some people give rude, stupid answers to a really good (and serious) question?  I have the answer...but I don't want to get too philosophical on you (cough).

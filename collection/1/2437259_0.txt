You take the phone's receiver out for a date, buy it some champagne, lobster, chocolate fondue at a nice restaurant.  Then go out for a walk under he moonlight, and whisper sweet nothings into the reciever.  Take it back to your place, light up the fireplace, slip into something more comfortable and do what comes naturally.

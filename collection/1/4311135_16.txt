Last  time  i  looked,  the  BNP  were  blaming  immigrants  for  the  state  of  the country,  now  your'e  blaming  the  'fat  cats'.  I  agree  with  you  the  whichever  so  called  'government',  whether  Labour   or  Conservative  have  been  ripping  everyone  off  and  lining  their  own  pockets.  I  don't  know  if  voting  BNP  is  the  answer  but  things  are  not  going  to  stay  this  way.  This  war  will  change  everything.

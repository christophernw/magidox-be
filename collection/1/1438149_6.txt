Get a pack of vanilla ice cream. Mix it well with anything you desire. Some examples are mars bars (chopped) or even caramelized banana (chopped). To prepare caramelized banana, get a few just ripe banana, skin it then you coat it with icing sugar and baked till golden brown. Before baking, try to lay a piece of silicone baking sheet on your baking tray in order for this caramel not to stick on the tray. You can even mix vanilla ice cream with a little yogurt and M&M candies. The kids will love it. As for adults, try rum raisins.As for pizza, dial that number in your area for delivery. Haha!

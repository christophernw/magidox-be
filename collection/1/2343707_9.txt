I agree... to an extent, I went to 1 when i was a teenager (my parents solution to my rebellion) and all she did was put me on a TON of medication and when it didnt help she uped my dosage until i ended up in the hospital. I quit seeing her immediately after that thankfully. Later on a few years later however I started feeling depressed and anxious and I talked to an excellent therapist and that did help me! however she referred me to anger management-which was a JOKE! I have met alot of doctors that in my opinion are QUACKS... If i knew someone with a mental illness I'd say talk to friends and family before and after seeing  an kind of doctor... Someone who doesnt know you or anything about you may not have the answers you need to lifes problems!

So they can crash into black ice while walking along in a ghost costume on Hallowe'en at age 44, then get sent to the hospital for a week to get knee surgery.  They charge you for the crutches and try to sell you knee braces and special bandages and walkers.  Happened to a friend of mine who lives on a reserve up North.  You think that's bad, at least they work.  The white upper-class kids down here steal stop signs, beat up old people, swear constantly, sell pot, use rock and crystal meth, steal constantly, mug people, leave garbage everywhere, spray graffiti on churches and smash pumpkins.  . . In my entire life I haven't picked a fight or bullied anyone.  I have had to defend myself three times against troublemakers and hoodlums, stole a number of times and simply tried pot.  That was it.  I cannot drink more than a bottle of white wine or three or four beers.

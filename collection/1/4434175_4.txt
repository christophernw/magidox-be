With all inclusive you pay for your food and drinks effectively before you go on your holiday. Some resorts / hotels let you have all drinks free some will specify just local beers wines and spirits so you may get charged for famous name brands of spirits if they are imported. The main difference to consider is do you expect to be at the resort/hotel all day every day, if you are going out on excursions or travelling round and are not there for meals etc all the time half board may suit you better.

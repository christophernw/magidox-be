I think I can top that.  Ever seen the movie Jarhead when he takes the big bucket of poop out of the crapper in the middle of the desert?  You then have to put a bunch of diesel or gas in there, then you set it on fire.  The worst part is moving the drum, it's so big that your arms have to go around it, and then to do that your face is only a few inches away from everyone else's poop.  Then you get to stir the poop while it burns to get it good and burned down so you can move it back...

In the words of hendrix "When the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace.". . It doesn't seem like everything will be solved. lots of problems is just the fighting alone. I wish that we could all be civilized and stop killing innocent people. As long as there are different counties and cultures, there will always be fighting and problems.

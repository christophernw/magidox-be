Americans pay for roads though a tax charged when buying gasoline.  The British pay directly though Road Tax.  . . My first thought is to suggest you to pack you bags and move to France as obviously, you haven't done much driving in France.  You may have seen a couple of France's best roads, but France also has some of the worst roads in all of Europe.

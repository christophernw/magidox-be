I was waiting for a traffic cop to wave me on, but when he did, my foot would not press the gas pedal.  The cop glared at me for not obeying his direction and just then a car flew by and almost hit the cop.  If I had gone on like the cop told me to do, I would have been T-boned on the driver's side and likely killed.

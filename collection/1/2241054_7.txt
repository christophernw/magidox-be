Its a sad fact of life that even with the best will in the world, you cant get on with everyone. Ive also found that some people, for whatever reason, see stepping on other people to be the only way to rise in social circles, in schools and later in life, and even on this yahoo answers thing, where people want to look good. How to deal? roll your eyes and despair of these people ever getting any friends who arent like them, and laugh about it with half way decent people.

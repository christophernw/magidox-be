I remember how important it was to me to get my license at 16 to begin working and earning a paycheck. So I am not against 16 year olds getting their license. I do, however, agree with longer "probationary" terms for teen drivers. No driving (except work travel) after midnight, no groups of teens (more than 2) in a car without an adult over the age of 25, etc.

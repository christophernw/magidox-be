Dumb questions are easy to make fun of, or just give a sly, funny response.. . Intelligent questions are only answerable by people who are themselves intelligent. Apparently there is not an abundance of those people that frequent Yahoo answers (though there are some).. . You could also give a sly or stupid response to an intelligent question, but then you just come off looking like an idiot, a jerk, or both.

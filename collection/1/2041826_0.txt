Whether push or pull, it is a force and has a direction.. . If you apply the pushing force in the same direction as the pulling force then both are the same. One is not in any way better than the other.. . But in practice, when we push the direction of push is inclined toward the ground; that is we are actually pushing the object toward the ground and at the same time moving the object.. . But when we pull the object we are lifting object little above the ground and at the same time moving the object. This reduces the friction and makes the object move easily.. . In the previous case we are increasing the friction by increasing the normal reaction. . . As stated in the beginning, if we pull or push in the same direction then both are the same.

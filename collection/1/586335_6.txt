When you truly forgive someone you are affirming that you have the capacity to grow, change and love.  When you forgive someone, you create an opportunity to have peace with them, and peace is a very good vibe.  When you don't forgive, you are essentially cultivating negative things, like anger and resentment.  Though it initially might require effort, forgiveness in the long run frees you so that you can nurture more positive things in your life.

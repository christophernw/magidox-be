Some Dude is correct.  Red coloration is attractive to birds.  Red fruit get's eaten by the birds and the fruid seed passes through the birds digestive tract to hopefully grow up in it's new location.. . The flowers that are normally pollinated by birds instead of insects are usually red, to attract their pollinators.

I don't know about the Catholic Church but for many Christians it's because so many people out there are taking it as truth!  I mean - for real!  . . You have not idea how many times I have typed the word 'fiction' when people talk about the Da Vinci code.. . I haven't seen it, though, and the only thing that has stopped me is because everyone tells me how long and boring it is.

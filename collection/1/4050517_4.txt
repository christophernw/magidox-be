Questions to ask is is it an electrical problem where one or more wires have come undone.  This happened to me with mine.  Also is this a bike or scooter as some manufacturers of scooters have a safety cut off so it wont start if the side stand is down. Scooters being automatic can also have problems with electricals when the wires get wet from washing the bikes with hoses etc.

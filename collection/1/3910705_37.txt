Cruising speed for most commercial airlines averages 530mph. You'd have to reduce your airspeed so much that you'd run a risk of stalling the engines, and the altitude would be a problem as well. The cruising altitude is between 29,000 and 38,000 ft.  The air is very thin at that altitude and like the gentleman stated above your lungs would freeze from the sheer cold at that height.

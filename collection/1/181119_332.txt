picking strawberries, mowing lawns. or helping mom around the house(cleaning garage, basement, or attic) the big projects everyone puts off.. got my teen a job at fast food restaurant(she hated it for 2 days but once got first paycheck) now she likes it with the paycheck coming in.. maybe a paper route.

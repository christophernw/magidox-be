Laws of economics - supply and demand. The supply is there, but very little, little, little demand. Outside of poets, English professors, and students who have to read poetry for a grade, not many others read poetry. My theory why - poetry moved from the soul of a nation to the academic classroom. Enjoyment of poetry for the most part stopped and analyzing poetry became an academic requirement. Reading poetry should never be considered work, it should be enjoyed. Unfortunately, the academic class begs to differ.

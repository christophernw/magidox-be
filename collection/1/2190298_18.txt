I am taking tonight off work (second shift child care teacher) and going to my dads house. I havent seen my dad or siblings or stepsiblings and their children since last July. Not everyone will be there but some of them will. We are spending the weekend at a hotel just because we can. So that will be fun for the children. Then Sunday we are having a Easter breakfast with my dads family and an Easter dinner with some of my moms family.. My daughter made out like a bandit this year with Easter just like she usually does every other year with every other holiday. Easter is like three days for her. Between school and then shes getting an Easter basket with my dad, with my moms family and from me.

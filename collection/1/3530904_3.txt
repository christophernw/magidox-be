I've seen packs of four, six, eight, and more of dogs and sausages.  Prewrapped bacon...I guess they figure those of us who still eat bacon are prehistoric enough to not mind using a great big one pound bulk package of bacon. (hee-hee)  I have seen pre-cooked bacon that you simply warm up...pricey!. . You gotta be a small town girl.  If that's your real pic, you're sweet!  I just found this answers stuff (Ive only been on-line a few years) and I am lovin" it!  See ya 'round Brit'.

I don't particularly have that feeling; I just know that my religion is right for ME.  Personally, I don't care what anyone else believes, although it's always nice to find others who believe the same way.  But it's not essential.  I believe that all paths that teach kindness towards others, good ethics and the difference between positive and negative actions lead towards the same place.

It dilates the blood vessels in your head which helps to relieve the pressure.  Although, I find that the Excedrin Migraine does not have enough caffeine in them to fix my headaches.  I usually add a cup of tea or coffee or a can of coke to the  mix....that usually does the trick.. . Excedrin Migraine not only has caffeine it it  but also contain Tylenol and aspirin in it and I think it's well worth the money.

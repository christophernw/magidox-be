For those with religious persuasions, a Dove tattoo means the Holy Spirit. If the Dove is facing upwards, it means that you yearn to be closer to the Holy Spirit and it is an aid to your spiritual journey.  If the Dove is facing downwards, it is a prayer for the blessings of the Holy Spirit to be bestowed on you and from what I heard is a very powerful tattoo as long as it comes with the proper holy phrases/words and symbols.

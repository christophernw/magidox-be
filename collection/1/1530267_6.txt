Actualy you have the right idea,cold turkey is the only proven sure. way of quiting smoking.I did it but used gum a few times and that worked fine,it's just a matter of getting the urge off of your mind.. Staying busy helps.But the gum takes the craving away quickly.. Also a friend of mine also quit cold and didn't use anything but he works long hours and sleeps alot so he pretty much slept through. his hard times.

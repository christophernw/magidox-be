It first depends on what skin color you are trying to paint. If the person is caucassion, I usually mix peach with a hint of brown and sometimes mix orange or another color to accent it. I usually mix my collors on a plastic pallet until I find the right color I'm looking for. Then, I know what to use before I can start.

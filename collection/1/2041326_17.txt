I'd say 1984, Animal Farm, Brave New World, for political commentary, any Edith Wharton for social commentary, any Jack Kerouac to see another kind of life, Tom Robbins for things to make you think about spirituality.. There are a lot of books I think should be must-read, but I read a lot.  Kurt Vonnegut is another good one, I like many of his books, Slaughterhouse-5 tops the list, I think.  Douglas Adams, Thomas Pynchon, PG Wodehouse.  I think a lot of poetry should be must-read, such as TS Eliot, Ted Hughes, Shakespeare.

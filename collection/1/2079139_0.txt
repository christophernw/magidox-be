That's a prepaid mastercard from Green Dot.. . Green Dot is a name of a company.. A prepaid mastercard is a mastercard that works like a "gift card" that you can use at any stores (as long as they accept mastercard). Basically you pay a certain amount for the prepaid card and use it until this amount runs out.. There are prepaid cards for other types too (like visa & amex).

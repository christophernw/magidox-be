Substitute values in the equation. Start with eq #2. . 1.4=1.54 - (Ix1). . since anything times 1 is the same value. . 1.4 = 1.54- I.  Moving the value from one side of the eq to other. . 1.4-1.54 = -I. . -0.04 =-I. . therefore I = 0.04. . Now substitute this and other values in eq 1. . 0.04 = 1.54/ (r+1). . 0.04 x (r+1) = 1.54. r+1 = 1.54/0.04. r+1 = 38.5. r=38.5-1. r = 37.5. . Two unknowns: I = 0.04 and r = 37.5. . Hope this helps!

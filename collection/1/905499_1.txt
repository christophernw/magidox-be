Being that i have had numerous UTI's in the past from my pregnancies, Cranberry juice helps i know it's nast but it helps. They also have what is called cranberry vitamins at walmart that you take once a day to help prevent it. Always go to the bathroom after intercourse and if you feel the urge to use the restroom dont hold it in go as soon as you can.

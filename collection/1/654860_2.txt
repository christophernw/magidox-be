Afetr 30 days you are dropped from the system and classified as a desserter. One thing to keep in mind is that this is considered a time of war and  it's still legal to die by firing squad in the military if you dessert it's not used but it is there. Also it's just basic it gets better. Try to imagine hiding the rest of your life from the government.And think what happens when you're caught (everyone gets caught) Just go back and if you truley want out then tell your drill that you want out. They will give you alot of shit but they will chapter you ( kick out). The chapter to get is "failure to adjust"

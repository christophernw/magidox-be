Grace unto you, and peace,. from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.. . Jesus Christ was not killed.. The sign above the cross said "Jesus",. (born under law, of woman + Holy Ghost). and it was written in three languages.. . And in which things are an "allegory",. it is "as if" to say "cursed EVERYONE".. "Cursed everyone that hangeth on a tree".. (Lawed everyone hung up on grace + law). . Christ could not be holden of death,. because Christ did not law impute sin.. . We are NOT called the body of Jesus.. We are called the body of "Christ".. . Peace with God is "THROUGH Jesus->Christ".. The head of every man isn't Jesus.. The head of every man is "Christ".. And his head is notably God(Grace).. . The "grace"(God) of our Lord J->C with you all. Amen.

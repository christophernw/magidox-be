For practical purposes radar was a device used by highway police to detect, apprehend and convict speeders. It used the same doppler effect that you hear (in movies?) as a train whistle speeds on by. Although the whistle tone is constant it sounds higher while approaching (waves bunch up) and lower while moving away (waves stretch out) and wails from high to low while going directly past you. Radar does the same thing using radio waves (at the speed of light!) instead of sound waves. The instrument worked best when held at the side of the road, pointed directly at the speeding car coming head on. Errors could be made (with false arrests) if the instrument was not freshly calibrated each day, the signal bounced of the wrong vehicle (especially a large speeding truck) or bounced off a large billboard. Few made close observations at the time to defend themselves. Also in NY State, a lawyer told a class (of speeders?) that no radar case was ever upheld in court when challenged if the radar was in a moving patrol car, because of possible errors. Of course laser speed instruments are now used instead of radar and are perhaps more accurate (and harder to beat with fuzz busters, etc.).

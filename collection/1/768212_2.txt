If we would be looking at the spiritual world, if they want to be heard, we would hear them. I believe they could "talk" to us through the mind, could bring us scents, could touch us. If you mean from space there could be a number of ways, but I think if we were confronted from someone/thing from space, it would let you know it came in peace. I think if someone/thing from space found us it would be scared because it would not know how we are.

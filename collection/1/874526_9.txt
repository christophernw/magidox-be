If possible, have another job lined up before you "walk out."  But if/when you do decide to quit, do it calmly, no yelling or causing a scene.  Just tell them something like "I'm sorry, but I don't think I can be of service to you any longer and thank you for the opportunity you gave me."  REMEMBER do this in a place where it's just you and the boss.  (like in an office)  NEVER create this scene in view of or earshot of the client/customers.  Good Luck

First of all, I'm sorry your Father has to go through this. . I am an ex-smoker, and this is my understanding of the chances of still getting lung cancer. Smoking causes a gene mutation which allows the lung cancer. Problem is, the mutation can occur with the first cigarette smoked,or the last cigarette, or any of them in between, or not at all. When, (if at all) it occurs is different for each individual. So, the way I see it is, it's basically a crap shoot. As far as other variables, I am positive that is a possibility. Hope this helped.

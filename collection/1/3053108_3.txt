A really great question!! Thank you so very much. I would like to know why they so blindly believe in Megans Law also. Were you aware that little Megans Mother left her outside alone for 3 hours? Granted, that does not make what Jesse did ok to do, but had the child been supervised like she SHOULD have been it would not have happened. . . Sex Offenders are able to be rehabilitated. As a matter of fact, they have the lowest recidivism rate of all criminals, with the exception of murders! A child has a higher chance of being maimed, murdered, or harmed by a drug dealer/user, drunk driver, parental neglect, playground or school accident than being harmed by a sex offender! This is outrageous! All this is is knee jerk legislation that the politicians use to get votes by have the media turn the issue into an hysterical media circus!

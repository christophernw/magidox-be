The absolute value changes the sign of the function wherever it would otherwise be negative. For instance, if f(x) = 2x+3 then f(-2) = -1, but if f(x) = |2x+3|, f(-2) = 1.. . In order to integrate over an absolute value, it is best to break the function into pieces, where the part inside the absolute value is always positive or always negative. 2x+3 is negative wherever x<-3/2, and nonnegative wherever x≥-3/2. So we can rewrite f(x) = |2x+3| as:. . f(x) = {2x+3 if x≥-3/2, -(2x+3) if x<-3/2}. . To integrate a piecewise function, you just break up the integral into several integrals, so that each integral only covers one piece. Thus:. . [-4, 2]∫|2x+3| dx = [-4, -3/2]∫(-2x+3) dx + [-3/2, 2]∫2x+3 dx. . Which you may now solve normally:. . -(x²+3x)|[-4, -3/2] + (2x+3)|[-3/2, 2]. -(9/4 - 9/2 - 16 + 12) + (4+6 - 9/4 + 9/2). -(-25/4) + (49/4). 49/4 + 25/4. 74/4. 37/2

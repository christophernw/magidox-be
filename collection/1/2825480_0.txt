The reason - Dutch colonialism, as stated below.  Previously, there were scripts based on Arabic alphabet (though containing three extra letters - known as 'Jawi') and before that, various scripts of Indian origin.. . Of course English is, by your lights, perhaps, also 'culturally poor' in that it adopted the alphabet invented by the Romans for the Latin language.. . Anyone who can suggest Indonesia is culturally poor has obviously never been there and lives in cloud cuckoo land.

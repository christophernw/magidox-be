Because the god squad hijacked a pagan festival and claimed it was their own.. . They did the same with Easter, All Saints Day, Harvest Festival, Candlemas.. . You name it, the date of every Christian festival - and in most cases the traditions of those festivals - come from pre Christian times.. . PS: Sorry but after your edit you had to get a thumbs down ............ where the hell do you get the Picses bit?. . Does the bible say . . "And Lo while reading the news tablets he checked the horoscopes, and it was written that a Pisces shall be crucified on this day (but not before he's organised a bit of a knees up for his mates, including that Judas guy who grassed him up to the police)". . EDIT. . Watchman/gex lin. . Automatic thumbs down for me for doing a cut & paste of so much material, do you really think people will read that much ........... JUST POST A SUMMARY AND LINK if it's not your own work.

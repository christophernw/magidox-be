The first real, modern population boom in Salt Lake City was between 1900-1930 when garages were simply not something you needed. Many of the homes in Salt Lake City were built then and as families got cars but did not have anywhere to park them, it became common to add a carport. It's a LOT cheaper to build a carport than a garage. You can find garages in many parts of the city but like cities that did a lot of building before cars were very common, you'll find extensive neighborhoods of older homes and no garages.

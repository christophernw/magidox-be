Shesh.....you people who look stuff up on wikipedia and COPY AND PASTE answers here are NOT answering peoples questions- youre not even using your BRAIN. Your taking SOMEONE ELSES answer from wikipedia and using it as your own, despite siting source, dont you know how to use your brain?. . People have often misunderstood this saying and twisted it to be an insult to native americans.. Ok, youre dealing with native americans and early white settlers. Theres a LANGUAGE and culture barrier. This sets up situations for misunderstandings. The whites would be "given" certain items to use, but in actually the indians had allowed the whites to "borrow" the items. So when the indians wanted the items back, the whites made the assumption that they were TAKING what they had freely given them. So the term indian-giver was born. . It was all a misunderstanding brought on by not knowing the language. Such as what happens today when people hear a muslim praying in the airport- without knowing the language, too many americans BELIEVE the muslims are about to blow something up- (WHICH Is freaking ridiculous) because we as americans have a language and culture barrier seperating us from other nations. When we as human beings, do not understand something- we FEAR it and make up stories about it to further instill that fear in others and justify our own fear. Such as again, indian-giver. It heavily implies that indians are liars and theives. Its crazy.

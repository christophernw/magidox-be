HCl is an acid & a pH past 7 indicates that the solution has become alkaline or basic in nature as per the Lorentz pH scale.Now dilution is nothing but increasing the volume of solvent in solution & in a HCl solution, water is the solvent.As water is neutral(neither alkaline nor acidic) hence introduction of water in the HCl solution cannot completely change the nature of solution(acidic).Theoretically,at infinite dilution the pH value of the HCl solution will touch 7.

as best I can tell....:.   when materials get hot, that is just heat energy being absorbed by the molecules. When the molecules recieve energy, the electrons become exited and start going faster and faster. In any material, the molecules are in constant motion, so when the electrons speed up, so do the molecules in motion. That is why things liquify and evaporate, because the molecules are moving so fast and bump the other molecules apart.

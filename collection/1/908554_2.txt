evolution is the biggest threat to their faith. I have posted this several times about how it works so this time I will make it brief. Evolution removes Adam from eating an apple in the garden and getting cursed with the original sin. No original sin wipes out any need for jesus as a universal savior. No Jesus ends a religious business worth over 3 billion dollars a year. They will fight very hard to deny evolution.

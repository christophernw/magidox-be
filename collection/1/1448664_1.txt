One way only ANTIBIOTICS! Remember the skin is the largest organ in the whole body. Yes it is a organ! It protects the rest of the body. If you had a kidney infection or lung infection you would treat it with antibiotics you need to treat cellulitis as well.

This is what happens to burn victims as well.

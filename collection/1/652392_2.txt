Your heater core may be going out or your thermostat might be getting ready to take a crap.  My 92 GA currently has no heat because of the same thing.  Just get it fixed before you blow the head gasket.  And if your oil is milky and there is white smoke coming out your exhaust, sorry, RIP.  Not worth fixing.

I once shared a passenger jet with a dolphin.  Part of the floor in an aisle was removed.  There was a rectangular tank set into the floor.  The accompanying human sat in an adjacent seat.  The flight was within Europe (shortish - 2 hours max).  The stewardess could just walk past the edge of the tank, which was open on top.  Everyone one on the flight adored the dolphin.  It was the passenger everyone wanted to sit next to!

As long as there's a standardized language, individuals can deviate pretty significantly from it and still be understood.  However, if there were no standard then everyone would have their own dialect of the language and you couldn't be certain that one person would understand another.  You also wouldn't have reliable references to the language such as dictionaries and thesauruses (thesaurii?) since the structure of the language would depend on each individual.. . Grammar is the standardization of English.

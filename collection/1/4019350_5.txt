I will honestly answer this question, hoping that YOU are not being honest with us. If you were hit two weeks ago, any signs of concussion and/or brain hemmorages(ie bleeding) would more than likely have shown up then. For blood to be coming out now, that seems rather unlikely, but obviously you should not be concerned with making it stop, just go to the Emergency Department, and find out WHY it is doing it.

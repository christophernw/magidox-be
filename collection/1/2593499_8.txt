i think you mean why are most blacks democrats.  The answer is because of the political shift in the 1960's.  Namely President Johnson's civil rights act. Since then many blacks switched to the democratic party, and passed on those allegiances to their children. The democratic party is much more socialistic in the distribution of wealth, so the poor tend to get more perceived benefits. Many poor people were black in in the 1960's and 70's and could identify with this party. At the same time the republicans were pandering mostly to traditional American ideals, and were getting large donations from the wealthy, further distancing themselves from the poor, and blacks included. its really a function of economic class, not race.

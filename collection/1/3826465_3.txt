I consider myself a Gnostic Christian, I have no hate for anyone.  It is not the fault of alot of good people that have faith in their belief, to be persecuted. They have not done anything to us.  Remember, one bad apple spoils the whole bunch? They can't help it that one nutbagg has made a bad interpretation of their belief system.

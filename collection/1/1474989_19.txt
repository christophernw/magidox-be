Life has its mysteries even for Christians. Not that I can speak for all Christians for I can only speak for myself. God is good and merciful, but the devil is like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. We have to guard our lives not to let evil in. Your friend was fooled. In my opinion, she was murdered.. I agree that something good may come out of her sad story. Maybe this will benefit someone reading this, like another teenager contemplating heroine.. Our time on this physical plane is limited. Our only hope for the next life lies in Jesus Christ. Personally, when I hear such stories I want to share Christ more.

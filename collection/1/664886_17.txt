I'm not an theist but understand the attacks. If you compare American sects versus most other countries you will find this form of zealotry. Also consider Mormans and Jehovah witness just adds to the mix. . . The extreme levels things are taking to and changed in America will bring on critics. Trust me ifyou were in Europe you would not find this (as much).

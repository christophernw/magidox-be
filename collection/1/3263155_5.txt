Jesus came into the world as a baby. He was hungry, he had to rely on his mother to feed him, I sure he fell and skinned his knees sometimes, he got tired and needed to sleep. Oh, he definitelyknew what it was to be human. And he experienced temptation which can lead to sin, but he had no sinful nature in to sin. He was pure as refined gold. He did not need to sin to understand being a human.

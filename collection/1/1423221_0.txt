People need to know and understand the development of a child and the stages that children go through. Too many people have no patience for children because they dont understand them. I think if more people understood child development there would be less of a chance of "accidental" abuse. Even though I dont believe that it is possible to be an accident I do believe that when a person's temper runs short they dont pay attention to how it affects the people around them, especially kids.

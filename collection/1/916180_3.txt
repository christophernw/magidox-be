I call it making kitty biscuits. He's kneeding your flesh. It goes back to when he was a baby and would kneed his mom's breast while he breast fed. Most cats do it their whole lives. It soothes them and is relaxing. I love it when my cat does it. They only do it on people they like and it's usually accompanied with purring.

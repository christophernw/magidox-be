usually this occurs in more modest neighborhoods. im not sure why it occurs in the poorer areas.. near military bases this will occur when someone is getting out of the military. the person getting out, on their last day will toss them into the air, as celebration like graduation caps on graduation day. not all enlisted personnel do this, but it does happen on occasion.

Being politically incorrect is not a bad thing.  Political correctness can obscure truth.  What is a bad thing, I think, is name calling, and assuming that those who don't agree with you are somehow less intelligent, or less aware, or less concerned than you are.  . . There are a lot of serious, thoughtful people who oppose the war in Iraq for very good reasons, just as there are people who support the war for good reasons.  I think your plan to join the Marines and get into a war is a good one.  It will either reinforce your beliefs, or give you some reasons to question what you believe.  Either way, you will grow and learn.  And that's really what we're all here for.

English mistranslation,...should be YHVH, (YaHVeH - jireh, God will provide)  YHVH is locked in the original Hebrew manuscripts. There are no J's in Hebrew and the English translation also takes away the V and adds W,..but Gods true name is YHVH.  God does NOT take the name allah. Another mistranslation.  There are many little gods like allah who is the moon god, but only ONE True YHVH God The Father who sent His Son Yahshua Messiah, Jesus Christ.  No other God but YHVH is LOVE.

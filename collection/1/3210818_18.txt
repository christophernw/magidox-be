it is rather ironic that the americans who can't spell anything correctly and normally talk gibberish have the gall to mock simply because you made a spelling mistake.. I take your point! The americans are currently trying to decide (after over 200 years) whether or not to make English their official language. I sincerely hope that they choose another,preferably German - I would love to see how they mangle that to death!

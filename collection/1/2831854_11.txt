Try feeding your cat meals. I feed my cats twice daily. 11pm, and 11am. Feeding them one meal just before I go to bed keeps them from waking me up. They've become accustom to the times. If it's 11:30, and there's no food in their bowl yet, they are sure to let me know. This also helps to prevent them from overeating. I can't imagine how much they would weigh if I gave them "free choice" feeding.

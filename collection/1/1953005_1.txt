Well Venus is much closer to the sun than we are so it is a lot hotter there... stuff that exists as a liquid here (water) would only be able to be a gas there due to the high temps. This also makes the atmosphere there much denser than ours. Not much sunlight would penetrate the thick atmosphere so there isn't any plant life to contribute oxygen to and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere the way plants do here.

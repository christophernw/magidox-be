Go to bullyonline.org (I know I know I harp this one but check it out) Get educated on bullying. And threats are great, but I had this problems back when I was a working smoo. I felt compelled to carry my 9mm with me to work because this person was so threatening. (used a shovel to make his point) I had forgotten it one day but had my mace..Sure enough he jumped up in my grill screaming about something. I douched him with the mace. After that he picked on some one else..(little tiny guy maybe 85 lbs wet) THAT person had a can of WD40 on him.. he put his lighter up to the nozzle.. and torched the dudes eyebrows, eyelashes, mustache and half of his hair off. Believe it or not.. every one cheered..

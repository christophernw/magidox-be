To truely understand this one would have to first study . 1. Shrodingers Wave Equation. 2. Heisenbergs Uncertainity Principal. 3. Max Planks Quantum Theory first. . Then the concepts of Einstienian Relativity, Abdus Salaam Models for Breaking of Parity, The Concept of a Sea of Negative Electrons, and others. One would then be on the path to understanding the conceps of orbitals, clouds, etc - So the people who have already given their replies are collectively correct - but the "spin" is also relevant. Call it a ring or a cloud - Heisenbergs Uncertainity Principle Rules - so to cut it short since it goes into philosophy when you say "Why" - My answer is God Knows why they exist only in descrete rings - Lovely question and the next time you ask this kind of a question please add the meanings of descrete as different to discrete so as not to confuse laymen like the demoninlove.. Cheers Ha HA HA!!!

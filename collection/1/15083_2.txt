Nuclear power is a clean, long lasting source of power.  The power it generates relative to the cost of operation is very high.  . . Unfortunately, the interests of "the people" are not what those in power in North Korea have in mind.  The North Korean government wishes to develop nuclear weapons as a tool to negotiate in the world market.  It is commonly feared by other Asian countries that they will use nuclear power for destruction rather than to provide "the people" with electricity.. . The North Korean people have no say in what the Dictators do.  They live on only what is provided to them via the government.

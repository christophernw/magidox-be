Diet will not always work. You MUST find out what type of diabetis you have. Certain types can be controlled with diet, others require both diet and medicine which MUST be monitored daily.. . If you require medicine and do not monitor your sugar levels or take you meds serious problems will arise. I have taken care of patiants required to take medicine but fail to follow the orders of the doctors and medical staff. . . I took care of a patiant that within a month lost 3 of his toes because he refused to stop smoking, follow a diabetic diet, or take his meds.. . I had another patiant that had severe diabeties who refused to follow orders to stop smoking because he had poor circulation and with in aweek we had to remove his left leg below the knee.. . I would seriously find out what type of diabetes you have and follow all doctors orders. Good luck

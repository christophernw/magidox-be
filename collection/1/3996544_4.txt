The only way I can see to do it is using calculus. Take the derivative and see where it is increasing and decreasing. Whenever the derivative is positive it is increasing and wherever the derivative is negative it is decreasing. Wherever it switches signs the function has a local maximum or local minimum. . . Evaluate the function on each of these intervals and show that it only changes signs one time. This will show that there is only one root to the function.. . There is no rational root to this function, which means it is an irrational root.

I'm a yankee. But as far as I know, the only people defending states rights are racists. I wish non racists could understand that every time you bring the federal government in to a problem (such as katrina), you loose power to choose on a local level. You'll know when your states governor is impotent (politicly speaking), when you elect professional wrestlers, and Austrian actors to office. When I was young, governors called in the militia to restore order after disasters, but the men were viewed as neighbors, and friends. But now, the National Guard is locked into homeland defense, so mayors and governors don't have the means to solve their local problems. Historically, southern militias carried the stars and bars. Don't forget that. But don't through the baby out with the bath water! Have you any suggestions for a new state flag? What symbols could you use, that don't cary a lot of negative baggage?

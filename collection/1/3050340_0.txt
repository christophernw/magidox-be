Actually the more general answer (evolution) is probably better for this specific question. As I read it, the question is asking: how do alternative versions of genes (changes) appear in a population and then how are they maintained (accumulated)? Not all variation is maintained by natural selection, the other causes of evolution have an effect - drift, migration, nonrandom mating. Mutation is also a cause of evolution although, in the context of this specific question, it's probably better to describe it as the origin/source of the changes.

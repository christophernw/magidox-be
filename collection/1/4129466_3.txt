no to forget is to allow things to repeat themselves. why remember the good times if they make you feel bad about how things are. if you had a good friend and they moved away should you forget your friend all together? or should you forget their are flowers in the world just because it is winter? or perhaps you are referring to a personal relationship, in which case how will forgetting change the way that person wronged you? will forgetting stop that person from doing so again? forgiveness is divine forgetfulness is folly.

I love interesting people, as does the rest of the world. If you think you might be creepy, then it seems that you might feel you have an essence that is somewhat, unique maybe? Unique is good, and usually people are drawn to that, to escape the banalization of our society. Therefore, if people are still avoiding you, it might be an issue in hygiene. I cannot stress enough how important hygiene is; that means brushing, flossing, mouthwash at least twice a day, showering at least once (with shampoo always) and deodorant. If you already feel you are sanitary, then I would suggest that you take a few philosophy courses and meet other people that have been shunned by society. Philosophers have a superior sense of elitism, you will feel special in no time.

At 16, perhaps you should stay in the closet a little longer. What most people do not understand is that everyone, EVERYONE is physically bisexual.  We all have both male and female genes.  Somehow the gene balance isn't the same in all people... who knows why.  I don't know of anyone who chooses to be bi or gay or hetrosexual for that matter.  We are who we are. Religious people often say that God doesn't make mistakes.  If that is true, then God made you Gay for a reason. . . Another thing that most people don't understand is that there is a continuum between straight and gay... it is not an either or situation for most people... it is a sexual preference which may change depending on who you are with, or the stage of your life.. . I just don't think that telling your parents now is a great idea. But that is your call.  . . Good luck

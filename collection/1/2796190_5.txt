My sister does that.  She'd rather feel physical pain than deal with emotional issues.  She's almost killed herself a few times, and is not at all suicidal.  She's still living like this, scarred body and all, and she's 34 years old!!!  PLEASE don't do that!!!  Find a really good counsellor who you can trust, who you can talk to, who can walk you through learning to deal with emotional stresses so you can lead a normal life!  The best times in my sister's life were times when she allowed God to help.  You can truly find the best help in Him.

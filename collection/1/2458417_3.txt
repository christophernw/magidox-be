Its just a prefernce setting. Would you rather go through a menu in a language you bearly understand or browse through one you fully comprehend. I know both english and spanish and I am more familiar with English and feel i can get more things done rather than sitting with a spanish to english dictionary. It just makes things more convinient. Like cars, some would rather rive a luxery  vehicle and others an economy car. Its all preferences.

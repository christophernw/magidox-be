ice is colder. There is something called latent heat of fusion, which is the heat required by a solid to convert to the liquid state, at a constant temperature. Ice at 0 C is colder than water at 0 C because of this. In the same way steam at 100 C is hotter than water at 100 C.(latent heat of vaporisation)

I remember when I was in school I got this really bad report card, but I mean it was fucking SHOCKING.. so I hid it in my room thinking I was all smart and everything and my mum found the bloody thing anyway.. . If your grades are bad and that bothers you just make a promise to try harder.Because if you don't try harder, once you leave school like me you'll wish you actually did try.

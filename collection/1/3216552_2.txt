Hate is not an automatic sin. It is perfectly biblical to hate bad, defiled, or evil things.. . God is considered perfect by definition. If He created imperfect people, then that was His perfect plan.. . Free will seems to me to be important for a relationship. We seem to have been designed to choose to have a rleationship with God or not. It apparently satisfies some aspect of what/wwho God is to have a relationship with a part of His creation. Without free will, it would seem to be servitude of some type.

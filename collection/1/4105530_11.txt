Try getting a bottle of fox urin from any hunting store put several 4 or 5 drops on cotton balls and put inside some old pill bottles and put small holes in the tops! Throw them around in the flower beds! The cat will smell this and think a fox is near by that is a preditor to them and they will stay clear of the area! But you must redue this every 2 weeks or they will come back!!! Also you can try Kayne Pepper sometimes it works sometimes they just pee on it! I have tryed the stuff in the pet stores and it doesnt work as well as the Fox Urin... KayB

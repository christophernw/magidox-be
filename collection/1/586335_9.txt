Because when you are angry...it is like U have to keep reminding urself.. I'm mad ...I hate so an so.. each time you run those thoughts through your mind you are pretty much telling yourself U hate yourself.. That is what the mind hears, and so u put bad in you get bad out.. now... . Forgiveness is theraputic because.. when U forgive someone and say give it up to GOD.. the problem is no longer worrying you.. You can just let go and spend time thinking about good things.. You feel better, because you are not carrying that anger or holding a grudge for years...I know as SCORPIO...about holding grudges.. The only one it ever hurt was me.

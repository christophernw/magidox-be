the government makes it hard for them and limits the number of people from each country that we will let in each year. They usually use most of those on people that have a need to live here (for example: they have a child here, or they are married) They have to prove that they have a tie to their country so that they will eventually go back home. I know that to get a tourist visa you have to also prove that you have $10,000 in the bank in your country, most that come do so because they are poor.

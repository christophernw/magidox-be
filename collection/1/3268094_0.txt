With science we are able to provide more food for society. They are genetically altering the food we eat so it's, I wouldn't say always better quality, but it takes away our hunger. Compare a organic fruit to a genetically altered fruit. The altered ones are sweeter and bigger than the small and bitter  fruits. They affect our genes also. That is why people these days appear bigger.

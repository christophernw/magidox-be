It's important to have some kind of strategic placement in the Middle East.  Everyone knows that many Middle Eastern countries are enemies of Western culture (again, I said many, not all) so it is important to have access and allies in that region to be able to see what the enemy is doing and to be able to stop them when necessary.  I can explain more but I think you get the idea.  Israel is a fairly good democracy so that's where we are.  The U.S. likes democracies.

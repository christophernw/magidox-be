some religions may be against it, but legally in the USA, it's still legal.   I will be cremated cuz I dont like the idea of taking up space, paying for the space, keeping up the grave, and all the other barbarian things associated with cemeteries. And that's from a guy who buried his parents in typical graves a long time ago. But, not for me, thanks.

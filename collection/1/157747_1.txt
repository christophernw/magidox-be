I suggest sprinlking baking soda all over the upholstery and carpets, let it set over night, then vacuum out.  This should absorb the odors or at least neutralize them, especially if you can leave the windows open to air it out (but hey, if you live in a bad neighborhood, maybe not).  Might take a couple tries though.....Or, you could Febreze it to death.

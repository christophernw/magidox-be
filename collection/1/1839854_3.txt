maybe it came from someone running into someone else holding a beer at a sports arena, and his beer spills all over him and other people around him, while you are trying to run to the toilet. and the guy hollered "smooth move ex-lax" after all he probably paid 5 dollars for the beer.. . i don't know myself, but that is what happens when the ex-lax works, it becomes a smooth move.

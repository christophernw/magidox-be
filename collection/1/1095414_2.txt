It depends on what do you think a dimension is... basically a dimension is a quantity that defines an object.... In the same manner ,, time also effects the definition which cant be experienced sitting on the earth and moving with such small speeds as compared to the speeds of EM waves or so..but actually time also varies with place,, a one min. of the earth may not be the one minute of the other places of the universe or so.. That is why its a basic fourth dimension.... To get more about time and its properties try to study the THEORY OF RELATIVITY......u will get to know more

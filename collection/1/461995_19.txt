as a fellow preacher I can tell you sermons that are long wont be remembered nearly as a good quirky short one. God and the Bible can be made intresting if told in relation to todays events. I try to make 45 minute intresting sermon that tells a story or has intrest. I realize the Bible is not always intresting but I try to bring it to life and keep it short.

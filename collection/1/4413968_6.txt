I think there are many ignorant people in every culture.  But I do agree that Americans seem to have the least amount of awareness about other cultures.  Part of it is because the United States is so large and isolated, and many Americans never go outside their country.  Plus, they are highly influenced by the stereotypes presented in movies and on TV.  For some people it's easier to think in terms of stereotypes as opposed to forming one's own opinion.

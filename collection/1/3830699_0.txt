The only two places that sugar cane is grown in the US are Hawaii and Louisiana. . . Corn syrup is cheaper and the midwestern states have much more political clout, so getting companies to adulterate their products with corn syrup is a big economic and political thing. . . I can taste the difference. If you ever have a Coca-Cola in Mexico and wonder why it tastes so good it's because they use real sugar.

If you mean to have them go in a special part of the yard?. It is far from simple, first you need to teach you dog to go potty on command, and believe me it can be done.. When they go potty tell them potty, good over and over.. When they seem to have that down then take them to an area and tell them potty. Always the same area, never let them go else ware.. The second half can take quite a while and is harder on you than them.. But it has been done!

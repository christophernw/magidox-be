glass is more dense because its more solid than water.glass is is both a solid and a liquid. just go to an old building with real glass panes.take a micrometer and a ruler.measure the top and bottom of the pane w/micrometer then use ruler to measure micrometer at both points. you will find that the top is thinner than the bottom.this is not true for plastic unless it was made that way

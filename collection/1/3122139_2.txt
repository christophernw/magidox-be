some things may sound stupid to u. u may try to drink a cup of milk before going to bed, it helps really often. another way of fighting against it is to manipulate your environment, i mean make your bedroom be a bedroom and nothing else. dont eat in bed, dont study in bed, try not to watch tv in bed, coz in this way u associate ur bed only with sleeping.as one of my teachers said, the bed is there only for sleeping and sex. thats all. results will show up in short time, but not immediately. and one thing, if u cannot sleep dont stay in bed too long thinking about your insomnia, u may even try cleaning up or anything else that will tire u and make u prefere sleeping to that dreadful thing.. hope this will help.

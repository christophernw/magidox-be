Well, WWII might not have happened. Might have, but maybe not. Don't think you could really divorce the Holocaust from WWII. Anyway...If so, then we'd probably have a tripolar world between US, Soviet Union, and Europe. With many more conflicts. Europe probably would have been much stronger.  More conflicts with Soviet Union. . The current state of Israel wouldn't have been created. Much more violence and hatred toward jewish people.

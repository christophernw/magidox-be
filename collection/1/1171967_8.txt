You're correct - it's unexcusable, regardless of the sonogram issue.. . In answer to a question below, why do Pro Death people feel they always have to force their values (or lack thereof) upon society?. . It has to be one way or the other. Either you force yours (or lack thereof) upon us, or we force our values that protect the innocent upon you. That's the purpose of sound law - to constrain the lawless, and we understand that Pro Death will be upset.

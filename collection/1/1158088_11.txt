I think it a bit sad that your neighbours dog doesn't bark.  Barking is such a natural thing for dogs to do.  Cats meow, birds chirp, cows moo and dogs bark.  I hope it just chooses not to and hasn't been FORCED not to.  My dog barks TOO much and I'm trying to teach him to minimise it but I'm glad he CAN.  Maybe you should ask your neighbour.  Great ice breaking question.

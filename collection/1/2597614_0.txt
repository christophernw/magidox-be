You may not want the realtor to know you are suspicious.  If this is the case go online and find the phone number to your states real estate commision.  If he says he is a realtor you can call the board of realtors.  Most state require that agents work from an office, however, some allow agents and brokers to work from home under specific guidelines.  I would check him out. I hope this will help you.

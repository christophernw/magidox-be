This, along with numerous other questions, underpins my belief that Science and Religion are not compatible   Science = based on evidence and the continually questioning supposed fact; meaning if new evidence surfaces, it's OK to to update the facts.  Religion = based on faith.  Just believe it.  Question it?  Just as you have done above... not part of the gameplan.. . Today, this argument is often termed as "creation theory", or more specifically "intelligent design" ... so my question back - who created the creator then?

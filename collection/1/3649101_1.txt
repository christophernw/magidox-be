Same reason stupidity isn't illegal in the USA.. They have the right to run their business as long as they don't break the law, and they have met the requirements of the federal government as a business opportunity, similar to franchising.  . . You could do some research about it, and learn more instead of blindly asking such a question.. . By the way, I am not affiliated with Amway, although I once was a distributor.  I just didn't have the drive to build the business.  Others have done well in this 'soap' selling business.

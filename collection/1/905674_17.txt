Your best bet, take it to the vet and get their opinion. If you listen to the people on here, you'll wind up doing something stupid that will be fatal to your dog and her puppies. Like I said, I would take it to the vet just to get their opinion. I guess you could always wait out the pregnancy and then give your dog medicine. I would just go get professional help. =]

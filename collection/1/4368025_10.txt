I have asked forgiveness of my sins and have forgiven those who have sinned against me i have accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and savior and i have shared the Love he has given and i have let people know of his coming for i do not want to see anyone left behind this is a very real event that is going to take place Just like the Super Bowl is real and people buying there tickets for it but you the price has already been paid with the Blood of the Lamb Jesus Christ so for us it is free just accept the gift God has given God bless you all i hope you will be ready

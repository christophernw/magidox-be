Don't totally stop eating, eat light. But when inapropriate cravings hit, KEEP BUSY!!! clean, get online and chat, walk the dog, do laundry/dishes, play with kids/siblings, draw, doodle, get on the phone..... whatever works.. that's how i quit smoking and that was a 22 year addiction.. working that way, i quit smoking and lost weight at the same time (fifteen pounds too)

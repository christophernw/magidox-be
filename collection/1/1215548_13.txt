as chair you have no hidden agenda. your purpose is to keep the meeting on track and not drift off topic (oh believe me its so easy)  . . you will let everyone have their say, regardless of how contentious their issues arer, and you will make sure no one gets out of order, because an affable meeting can soon become a battlefield if you dont keep a tightish rein on things. . . your secretary should have produced an agenda for the meeting and its upto you to keep to it. its also upto you as chair to decie how long the meeting will go on  for... dont get bogged down in periphery and other nonsense which you cannot control or influence.... . and you get first dibs on the biscuits...

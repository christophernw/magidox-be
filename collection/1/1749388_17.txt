We find the middle east country that has the most people dancing in the street celebrating and we start there. When we have finished them off we move to the middle east country next to it and finish them off. . . Untill they are so backwards there is not a plane car, electricity, dam, building or anything moderen in the middle east. Untill everybody is living in caves. Then we forget they exist.

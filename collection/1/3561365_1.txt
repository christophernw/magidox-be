Atoms have been directly imaged, you can't image them in the optical wavelengths.  Atomic force microscopy(AFM) and electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) all have atomic resolution.  AFM doesn't see as clearly in that range, SEM is a bit better, and TEMs will shoot an electron through the sample and get diffraction patterns from the sample to see the atoms.  Quarks however have never been imaged since the only place to see them would be in detectors at large accelerators, hard to stick a microscope in those things :)

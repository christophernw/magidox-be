God is seen as male because of the male domination upon the earth.   Males use violence to achieve superiority.  But through mother nature god has had an ally in balancing the destruction of man.  The changes inputted by her are slower but non violent.  She is the inspiration behind, women's equality movements,  the hippie movement. and social consideration for the poor as well as children. She uses a non violent approach to influencing humanity.  She is not god the creator is, he will someday reflect what he truly is... a reflection of nature which is equally represented by male and female.... therefor it is more appropriate to call god IT.

Go to the garden supply and get some Sevin Dust. This used for aphids, but a vet told me years ago to use it for flea control IT WORKS!, and it's cheap. You pour some into an old nylon stocking. Fill the foot and tie it off. Then take the bag and pat your dog the area she lays down to sleep. It will kill the fleas and when the fleas eggs hatch it will kill those fleas as well! It will not harm the puppies and will keep the fleas off them, too.

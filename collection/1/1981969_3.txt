Most people have medical insurance and do not realize the cost of a doctor. People do not have medical insurance on pets usually and it is costly to take your pet to the vet.  Where I live there is a vet that is very reasonable, more than any other vet I have heard of and he told me once that most veteranarians are out for the money, they charge triple for what the medicine actually costs. He charges just a small amount over what it costs him. I took my dog in there for Parvo, he charged for thirteen days, 84.00. How many vets are like this? He does really well for himself also, and he is flooded with customers. If more vets would be like this one then there wouldn't be many pets die from illnesses not treated because they couldn't afford the vet bills.

According to Buddhist teachings, one must not believe just because it's written, or becuause it's logical, or because a teacher, Christ or Buddha himself is supposed to have said it. One is supposed to investigate, and find that it is the truth beyond all reasonable doubts. The more I read the Bible the more I see things that do not appear to be true. for instace why should you suffer because adam and Eve ate the fruit from the tree of knowledge. The Bible also says that the serpent tricked them. Come on! if Adam was created in the image of God how could God as well as Adam and Eve be tricked by the serpant.  Is virgin birth scientific? Why did God allow christ to be crucified if he was all powerful.  How come Pope John (God's Messenger) had Parkinson's. Please ask yourself these questions without prejudice and without preconceived ideas.

When your friends notice your face glowing and a new sparkle in your eyes.  You feel like you would do anything for that special person's happiness and they would do the same for you.  When you can talk for hours about everything or nothing at all.  When you can imagine your grandchildren crawling up on your lap and that special person is sitting right beside you even when you're old and gray.  That's love!

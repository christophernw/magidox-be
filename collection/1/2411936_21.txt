We (Christians) are under attack by a very real enemy.  The Truth is the Truth, yet people are believing the lies the enemy is spreading, things like the myths in the DaVinci Code.  Even your question has one, that other religions believe in the same God.  Jehovah God is NOT what ever it is that Muslims believe in.  They certainly do not worship Jesus Christ as Savior and God, so why do people say they worship the same God as Christians?. Christians are people, imperfect, and of many different levels in their walk of faith.  It is very, very hard for some to not "go psycho" when viciously attacked even though that is exactly what our Savior says not to do.

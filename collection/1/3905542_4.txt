wow...I was so suprised by some of the answers here. So many misconceptions about bipolars.. . The symptoms and their frequency for Bipolar disorder (Manic Depression)is different for everyone. Being a rapid cycler (moods changing quickly) is very rare in Bipolar Disorder. It is something more closely associated with Borderline Personality Disorder. . . For me being manic means going on shopping sprees and obsessing about some project to the point where I do not eat, sleep...just work on whatever I am fixated on. Speaking very fast...feeling like I can't get a word in edge-wise in a conversation when in reality I am dominating the conversation. Having all these huge ideas of things I need to get started on. When I am manic I am a list making fool. I will write all these list of things I need to do, fix about myself..etc.. Some of them can get quite bizarre.. . To me depression feels like not wanting to do anything...not even to get out of bed to even take a shower. Feeling like life is pointless. Having thoughts of things I did in the past I am ashamed of (they play likea little movie in my mind), having suicidal thoughts. Being unable to remeber all the good things in my life or what it feels like to not be sad.. . If you think you may be suffering from a mental disorder, you should contact a mental health professional. They can diagnose you and helpyou get started on a treatment plan.. . Good Luck :)

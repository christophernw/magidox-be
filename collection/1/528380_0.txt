Batteries that are small are like watch batteries and  cordless phone batteries are sealed in drums with other hazardous materials, larger batteries such as Laptop and car batteries are often recycled for there heavy metals.  The batteries that are disposed of are usually done with a bonded service so that someone will be held responsible in 40 years when the drums are leaking into our groundwater supply.

In the criminal contexst, statutory rape laws are generally strict liability, meaning regardless of consent, a person has no defense.  In part this is based on a principle that a minor does not have the capacity to give consent.  22 having sex with a 11 year old, I would believe, even in GA, is stat. rape.  The prosecution would have to prove, that the act happened-- that is all.. . As for a civil suit, you would have to bring it upon behalf of the minor.  I would think you could bring it as tort case-- assault, etc.  But if he has no money, no lawyer would take the case.

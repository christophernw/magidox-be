A counsellor told me that for every one time someone tells you something negative about yourself (or you tell yourself something negative), you need to be told, (or tell yourself) the positive antidote 14 times to undo the damage.  Just keep doing that until you believe the good stuff. . . It also helps if you truly believe that every single person (including yourself) is unique and precious, and true worth can not be acquired with money.

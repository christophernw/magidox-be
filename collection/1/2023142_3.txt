I think men have traditionally thought of women as more evil because they have been seduced and enchanted by us, and we have made THEM think "evil" thoughts, so to speak, so they blamed it on us, rather than admit their own weaknesses and temptations. So throughout history we got a bad rep. Personally, I think men are more violent and vengeful, and women are more catty and spiteful at times, so we are equally flawed.

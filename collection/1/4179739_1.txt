Some people learn by being shown, and some learn by reading up on things.  The hardest part about teaching can be figuring out which of these categories each of your students fall into.. . Everyone has a trigger that suddenly turns the light of understanding on for them, and a good teacher develops an ability to find those triggers.  There will be times, in any group you're teaching, that one single student just doesn't get it, no matter how you present it.  This doesn't mean the person is stupid or unable to learn, it just means you have to try a little harder to find their trigger.  Even the most intelligent person can develop a mental block about something that prevents their "getting it" it once in a while.. . So to me, the best teacher is one that understands their subject so thoroughly that finding a way to help their students grasp it, or being able to present it from several different angles to the same result, ends with everyone in the class having successfully understood the subject matter.. . I don't believe that a student's failure to learn is necessarily the student's fault, as long as they're at least trying to understand.  It is very often a teacher's apathy that is the real problem.. . I like very much the fact that you're looking for ways to improve your skills - it shows you really care, and that is major step forward.. . Thank you.

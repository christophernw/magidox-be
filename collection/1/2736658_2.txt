take a nap, if you wake up you don't have one or it's not that serious, if you don't wake up then you've got a pretty bad one.. . But seriously, you will definitely know if you have a concussion.  If things just feel a little off, you're a little woozy, light-headed, and maybe have a headache then you're not that bad.  If these symptoms are much worse then go to a doctor and don't take a nap first.

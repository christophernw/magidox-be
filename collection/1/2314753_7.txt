They don't want to define themselves by a single terminology. There is always the off-chance of a person who declares himself "straight" or "gay" to fall for the opposite of what they normally follow and using the word "bi" is just an easy way of getting away with it.. Most of the girls who say they are bi, it should be noted, are high schoolers who do it for the attention it brings from other boys. Most people settle down with a single gay or straight once older.

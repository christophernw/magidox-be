I think that you need to throw the word some or many before the word christian.  . . It is not all of them that think this way and that is how the question is posed.. . I am not religious but I do know many who are and they do not act as foolishly as many of the christians on this forum do.. . Just make sure that you don't make sweeping allogations about a whole group of people because it is not fair to the ones that don't act that way.

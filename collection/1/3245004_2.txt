hey pervey pirate, i haven't forsaken you. i stayed home and ran through the questions till i found yours. you haven't been in jail have you? .    i have been drinking coffee and smoking little, cheap cigars all day..    people were freaking out because you weren't there. they all broke and ran..    does that make them apostles?.    did you just need to take a sabbath?.    is that what kept you away from the father's buisness?.    pervey pirate stay so we'll be blessed.

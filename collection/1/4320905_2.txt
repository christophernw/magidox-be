Both the circulatory system delivers oxygen oxygen to the tissue which is use to supply energy and the respiratory system delivers oxygen from the air to the blood. The pulmonary artery  takes deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs and the pulmonary veins carry blood rich in  oxygen from the lungs to the heart.  In respiration enery is release from food by oxidation i.e by reacting it with oxygen.  This is known as aerobic respiration.

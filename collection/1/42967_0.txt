You would have to trade your produced product directly which would of course undermine capitalism but I suppose that's what you want to do.  Money has it's good sides though, for example, if you made airplane parts then the only people you could trade with are people who need airplane parts or know how to make a profitable trade.  The bad part about this is that you'd have to trade until you got something that the people who have something you need want.

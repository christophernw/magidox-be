by fuzzy lines, did you mean a black screen with moving diagonal. lines? . . If you have cable HDTV, did anyone unplug the cables on the back of the HDTV box and possibly re-insert a cabel back into the wrong jack? . . Is your set receiving any kind of signal?. . If you just bought your set than chances are good that its not that! . . If you dont hear anything then you arn't receiving a video signal.. . Check all your connections and call tech support, if you're getting Comcast HD!  . . Good luck!

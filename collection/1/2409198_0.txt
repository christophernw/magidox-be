I wouldnt worry so much about the torque specs. Wrench them on one handed, placing your hand close to the head of the wrench, when your hand cant turn the wrench anymore then they are as tight as they need to be. thats usually about 75 to 80 lbs torque and thats what you want it to be.  you dont want the gasket too tight on there or it will rip. if you use both hands you are likely to use exessive force. if you are using a gun or going gung ho on the mo fo then you are likely to strip the threads on the tranny, i doubt you will do this as you have been warned.

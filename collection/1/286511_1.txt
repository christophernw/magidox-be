SLAP stands for Superior Labrum Anterior to Posterior Lesion.  The labrum is cartilage in the shoulder that makes the head of the humerus more stable.  The biceps does attach to the labrum.  A lesion to the labrum is a tear that occurs for many reasons.  It could be from a dislocation or a subluxation of the humerus or it could be from a pull of the biceps tendon.  It could also be from the way that the humerus has moved on the labrum.  Many times this can be taken care of with simple arthroscopic surgery.  MRIs do not show it very well and it is difficult to diagnose.  You should see a good shoulder orthopaedic surgeon if your doctor suggests a SLAP lesion.  It is more common in overhead sports like baseball, football, volleyball, swimming, and tennis.

I look at it the way a diamond crystallizes under very high pressure. That is the real world example we have to learn from like the inspiring story of "It's a Wonderful Life." The diamond earns its brilliance, dazzling, purity and strength from the transformation of the endurance and becoming something that gives us "awe" and "inspiration". I think that is why an angel must earn its wings.

You may be just overloading yourself and need a break. Take some time off and come back to your studies later. Sometimes you can have mental lapses and you just need to clear your head and start fresh later.. . Also, there may be issues with the air where you do your work. Not to alarm you but try another location such as a library or such. If things improve, maybe your first place of study has flawed atmosphere.

women are often emotionally stronger than men. that's probably the reason why they usually live longer. . . women can brought out all their frustrations, can cry, can shout and have no problems in admitting their weakenesses and limitations. they can blurt out how they feel and feel good about it afterwards.. . men, on the other hand, tend to dwell so much on solving the problem and have the tendency on taking the problem alone, which makes the burdens harder to bear. they have a harder time accepting defeat and weakness because they are expected by the society to be strong or at least, stronger than women. . . most of them have vices, aside from the fact that they are more of a risk-takers and thrill-seekers. . . in addition, i've read a survey that most of the times, whenever a man's wife dies, only very few of them were able to really move on. most of these guys who lost their wives, die few years after especially if they are left alone.

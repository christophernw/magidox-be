She was not a prostitute.  She was so prominent in the life of Jesus, the church has finally admitted this was a lie to take her importance away and tell that she was also an apostle.  The church did not like the fact that a woman had the same status as the other apostles-who were men.. . Her only sin was that she was a woman-not a good fact in the eyes of the church.

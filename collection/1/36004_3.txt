I'm not completely sure what the difference is between vellum sold for scrapbooking and the tracing paper sold in the office supply store.  Both are translucent papers, although I believe the manufacturing process and ingredients are different.  If you're doing scrapbooking, the important thing to figure out is if the paper is acid-free and lignin-free.  My guess is that the regular tracing paper from the office supply store is not acid- or lignin-free.  Over time, papers with lignins and/or acids will break down, and acids may transfer to your photos and ruin them.  For that reason, it is generally recommended that you only use acid- and lignin-free papers in scrapbooks.  Papers that are safe for scrapbooking are generally marked as being acid- or lignin-free or may be described as "archival quality."

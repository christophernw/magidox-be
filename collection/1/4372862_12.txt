It's superstitious fairy tale.  Ordinary folks make it to heaven then need to be tested to prove their worthiness for wings. . In truth there are only two kinds of angels that are believed to have wings none of which are here on earth.  They are devoted only to God.  One kind flies around the throne of God singing His praises and the other flies between Heaven and Earth to report to God all that he sees.. The Arch angels are powerful beings and have no need for wings.  The lesser angels haven't wings either they are simple spirits whom are driven by curiosity of man and their love of God to visit us here on earth.

The bus station is closed except at the earliest time you can wake up.  To be awake (in the morning, the earliest possible) you need the alarm clock (in one of the stores, the pawn shop I think, where you get the gun) and caffeine pills (bought in the other shop).. . The furniture store is closed until you have a better house, then you can go in and buy good furniture.

Vicki613 this is one of the best questions I have read on this site. Whenever I'm driving, or outside and I go from shade to a real bright sunshine I sneeze. It happens to me, my father and little brother (all light skinned with strawberry blonde hair) but it doesn't happen to other members of my family or family members with dark hair or skin. I wonder if it effects lighter skinned people only? I look forward to hopefully a real answer from someone here.

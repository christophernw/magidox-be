You are basically talking about science-fiction. I guess your theory is nice but I would much rather rely on Isaac Asimov's Foundation with the whole psychohistorians thing going on.. . In this book, scientists study the behaviour of humans on a mathematical level to determine what will happen in a thousand years with society, etc.

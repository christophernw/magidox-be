I know the play. I have been on the giving AND receiving end. It's very irritating. But no matter how much it irritates me, I must reference my own behavior and reasons for doing it, when I do. I usually do it when I sense someone is being too pat or smug or thinks they have it all figured out and if you disagree "well duhhh". I want to throw some flak into their neatly ordered sense of the way things have always been and will always be. One time I find myself doing it a lot is at work when a co-worker starts to display boss behavior. I want to back them off a notch or two. it works a lot of times. They come in with "We're going to do this today." --And I hit them with "But this is wrong. Wrong specs. I can't start until you have the specs." --and so on. That's the simplest example. But when debating loftier issues, the same principle applies: contradict as a way to challenge.. . I have given up on people who were friends, but too contradictory, by the way. I feel your pain.

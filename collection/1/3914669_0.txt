Because this is not some barbaric tinpot dictatorship. We are a civilised country.. Countries and US states with the death penalty still have a high rate of violent crime. . The death penaly makes martyrs.. The Birmingham 6 and the Guildford 4 were 10 innocent people that we jailed for years. They were set up because people were baying for blood. You can't pardon dead people, its taking the p155.. . The death penalty has been abolished, 'even' for treason. Which means plotting to bring down the govt, not plotting to hurt people.. . The rest of us have the right to live in safety. Life should mean life. Prison is not a cushy option.

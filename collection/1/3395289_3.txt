Water and eggs (sounds crazy I know) absorb the smells and tastes around it and because water is flavourless the foul flavour is more obvious, the best thing to do is put the water in a covered glass jug and keep your food containers covered or in covered tupperware.  also keep cut onions tightly sealed as well as garlic and give the fridge a good clean out with disinfectant and keep baking powder in the fridge to absorbe the nasty smells.

Black holes are a buffer in space to preventt on galaxy being sucked or drawn into another galaxy that isof a different time and phase fielsd.  Imagine a Large rubber ball suppended in the center of your bed room.  The ball has radials of thinn wire coming out of it to a distance of say, seven feet.  Now imagine at the the end ofthe wire there is an egg shell.  The sheel is earths galaxcy while the yoke is the earth.  Now imagine there is a string of these egg shells making a cicle about the rubber ball.  At the head and base of the sheel we have a small buffer of spounge so that the egg can not crash into the one nect to it.  The spounge is the black hole and is a buffer zone in space to keep our galaxy where it is as it expands anf grows through time along with the expanding universe.  The rubber ball is the source of creation and where all spirit life eventualluy returns to.  Earths die and new earths take there place.  Look at our earth and then look at Jupitor.  The avers earth life form is 6' and the size of the earth is masive.  Well in years to come, what size lifes forms will be living on Jupitor, twoo hundred foot high people?  We are just one small moment of life groth to the universe, like a three years old is to an eighty year old.  Hope this has helped you

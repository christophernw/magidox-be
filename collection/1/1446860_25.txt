I believe the better question is:  If "atheists" truly do not believe in God, then why are they so adamant about making sure our government passes enough laws to prove our Government doesn't believe in God either?. . There is no such thing as a true "atheist".   Madeline Murray O'Hara succeeded in convincing our Supreme Court that prayer should be banned from schools and in other public forums.  She professed to be an atheist.  However, in each profanity she spoke on air in her interviews, she used the name of "God."  . . Each time Jesus Christ cast out demons or performed miracles, it was in the name of God.  Satan will use his spirits to try and prove that the name of God has no power over the Earth.   Atheism is simply a form of Satanism run amuck.. . Every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess that He is Lord when Christ comes again.  Even the purported "atheists."  Oh, Lord----come quickly!

B/c Americans refuse to see what is really going on. They keep their heads up their butts and hope it'll all go away. They won't step up and assist those of us are trying to make a difference. They keep arguing the issue instead of researching and listening to the issues. They are being lead around by their bleeding hearts instead of their logical brains.. . Jessica- Thank you!! . . Vonnie - I don't know where you got your info. from, however, when you account for their (low) wage, the tax-paid (by US)services they get and the fact that nobody KNOWS how much they get paid in cash (since they only report the low wages) I guess anyone could save up enough money to put a substantial down payment on a new house, and I'm sure they 'qualify' for low interest loans, even though they are ILLEGAL criminals. You see, we have to file OUR income with the IRS and pay taxes on ALL of it. We don't lie to 'cheat' the system, as your illegal friends do. Those LEGAL citizens who abuse the system are wrong also. We as a country should and do deal with that issue, it's our business, not Mexicans, and even THEY are legal CITIZENS. WE will take care of that problem, however, that is irrelevant to the issue of ILLEGAL immigrants abusing the same system, it doesn't make it okay for illegals to do it, too.. OUR taxes paid for those schools, teachers and books. If an illegal immigrants kids are in the tax paid schools, even if those parents 'paid taxes' they are still illegal and should not be reaping the rewards of the American taxpayers many, many years of paying taxes. If they have been here long enough to have paid their fair share, they should have become LEGAL before now.

I write because it allows me to open a window for others to peer into the worlds and people I see. It's an amazing gift to take others on a journey to somewhere else, to open doors for new information, and to present ordinary things in a new light. Thoughts are the truest power that we, as humans, hold. To expand the thoughts of another, whether it is through fact or fiction, is the strongest connection we can make.

yeah.. i felt the same way, hmm thats when i came to answers.. its prolly the same reason i had.. that u dont need it.. ur prolly super smart, and know most of it, u prolly want more interesting challenging stuff.. just do it to prove that u are higher than ur unworthy peers.. and feel satisfied.. go to a great university.. become something great and show off.. but.. it all starts by doing ur HW.. think positively and you'll do it.. and it will pay off.. gl.. what is the hw btw?

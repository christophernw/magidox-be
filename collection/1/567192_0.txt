Dandruff is caused by eczema, a skin condition, which causes the skin on your scalp to shed away.  This can be treated by dandruff shampoo, but be sure to rotate the kind you use periodically and switch to shampoos with different active ingredients, or the eczema can slowly stop reacting to the shampoo u use.  Dandruff like symptoms can come from dry scalp which can be cause by over cleaning or styling your hair.

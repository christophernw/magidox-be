File a report again.  I believe now that you are over 18, the statute of limitations runs out at 21 (but I could be wrong on that); I do know there is a time limit after you are no longer a minor to report (I also think each state is different). It will be your word against his, however, the report would start a current investigation to see if there is any current molestation occuring. Good luck!

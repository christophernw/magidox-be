Mormon cult. Why? because they should wear long,sacred, bullet proof underwear, they have to pay in order to go to the temple, they believe god lives in a planet and when they die, if they get sealed (married in the temple)when they die they will live in a planet near god's, well the husband will with his wife if he decides to, if not he gets another one from a catalog or somewhere and in order to get in their heaven (3 stories/levels) you have to learn handshakes and passwords.........

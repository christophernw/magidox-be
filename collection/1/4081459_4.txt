NO NO NO  Don't do anything yet. A half liter is not enough to do anything. Start the engine, and check the dip stick while it is running for foamy oil. If the oil is okay, don't do anything. If it is foamy, you can remove that amount by changing the oil filter. If you remove the plug, alot more then 1/2 liter will come out.

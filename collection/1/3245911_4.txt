To say democrats will leave Iraq is ignorant.  We cannot leave Iraq and they know it.  Bush has assured this by pissing of most every mailitia and activist military over there, meaning we can't leave because they will immediately take over and then aim right at us.  You may hear Dems say "Were going to find a way out of Iraq" but I don't think its going to happen.  In fact, I think we may be over there until the end of time, inadvertantly Americanizing the country.

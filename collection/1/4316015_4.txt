DON'T DRINK COKE OR OTHER SOFT DRINKS CONTAINING PHOPHORIC ACID!!!. Do drink milk.. Exercise in a way that stresses you bones, but also gives them a chance to recover. Weight training and running are good, two or three times a week; but swimming and cycling will NOT help because your skeleton is not being stressed.

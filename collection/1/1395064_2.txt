I almost had several accidents with people that were talking on cell phones.  These people have no idea that other cars are on the road with them.  Sometime, I had to move over quickly to avoid them.  One car went thought a red light when I was already in the intersection and I had to quickly make a right turn to avoid a collision.  That person probably did not even realize that they ran a red light.

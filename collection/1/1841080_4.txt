Written word has existed longer than written history. The earliest known writting was done on clay tablets which served as books, later of course paper and eventually a printing press would be developed. The actual invention of books or the first writer is not known.. Early tradition says that books were passed along orally, that is people would memorize the entire text from someone else and then share it with others before the written language was developed.

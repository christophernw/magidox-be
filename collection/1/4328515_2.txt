Try visiting www.lush.com they make a variety of facial mask products from natural ingredients. Perhaps you can gain some inspiration from them.. . The one I make at home has flour, egg white, dash of lemon juice, and honey. Occasionally some ground up almonds for exfoliating. Slap it on, wait for it to dry and then rinse off.

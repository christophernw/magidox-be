i just read that "preferences in chemical taste also begin at or shortly after birth.  Newborns prefer sugar solutions over plain water and in the following fixed order: sucrose, fructose, lactose, glucose.  They reject substances that are acid, salty, or bitter responding to each with the distinctive facial expressions they will use for the rest of their lives."  (Consilience;edward o. wilson 1998.)  Maybe as we get older and search for a variety of energy sources we learn how to enjoy new tastes.  is it cultural or physiological?  i say both.  where culture drives the desire for new energy and physiology is the science of how the body processes the product.

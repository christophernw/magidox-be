I did not know they sleep in large groups. Perhaps they are afraid to sleep alone? LOL Maybe because the ant farm is considerably smaller than an environment they are used to and so it just seems they sleep in groups. Ants sleeping in groups makes me laugh..like a huge ant slumber party. Actually, I never really gave much thought to sleeping ants.

Ok a c_section is another way of delievery and what they do is they cut you right above your pubic hair line and they take EVERYTHING OUT than the baby and then they put EVERYTHING back in, for a person i dont agree with having one unless you need one but for a little dog like yours the reason for me would be cause she might have gotten knocked up by a bigger breed and i have heard these little riddle thingys where if little dogs get knocked up by the bigger breeds when its time to deliver them there inside normall falls out with the pups killing the dog so a c_section would be better to do than to watch all that gruesome stuff than again sweety its just a riddle thingy its fact or fiction. Hope this helps

Boy this is awful. I don't know what this guy is talking about pigs and s**t but.  It is very simular to a yeast infection.  It will start off with itching then it will turn into severe itching, next you will start to have discharge.  I've had tric 2 x's and each time the Dr assumed that I had clyamhdia, but when the test results came back I had trich.  . . I was so ashame to go to the doctor about it and I tried to go as long as I could thinking it would just go away.  It will become literally unbearable after awhile.  On a positive note it is very common.  Tric is not just a STD you can catch it just like a yeast infection.  It is also very easy to treat, you will feel immediate relief the minute you take the medication for it.

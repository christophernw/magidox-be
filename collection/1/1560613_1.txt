I'm a liberal and I don't believe we give aid and comfort to the enemy.  There really is not an awful lot going good in Iraq and the poll numbers reflect the public's feelings on the issue.  I've never heard a liberal bash the USA or the troops.  I have heard them bashing the President and his decisions.  As for communism, the whole wiretapping thing is as close to "Big Brother" as I've seen the US get.... "allegedly"

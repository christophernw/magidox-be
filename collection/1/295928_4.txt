Maybe because it is a faster, more intense high (not that I know from experience) but having talked to someone who was a former IV drug user, he said that other routes (smoking, snorting) take longer to get high and the high is not as good.  Having said that, to anyone who thinks that "hey, cool, she just gave me a great idea", my friend is also living with HIV (contracted through IV drug use) and had to have a line sewn into a vein going into his heart to deliver meds since his veins in his arms, legs etc are too scarred to use.  Seems like one hell of a price to pay for a little fun.

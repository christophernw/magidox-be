I guess it all depends on where one lives.  In my part of the midwest (USA), most of the problem seems to be with whites vs. Illegal Mexicans!  I work with, live next door to and get along well with Blacks and Whites and most Mexicans (Remember, I'm a Sasquatch).  However, it sometimes seems that the illegals want everything for free ... on their terms!. . It's gonna take some time but with any luck, Canada, the USA and Mexico will become one and unite with all man(woman)kind!. . Imagine the power of the free world uniting!!!. . Okay, a little off track here!  Why can't we all get along???. . Blacks and Whites have come a long way in the last 50 years or so!  Perhaps the same will happen with the rest of our brothers and sisters.. . IMHO,. . The Ol' Sasquatch Ãœ

If he is intrinsically good, some other source outside is the cause, and traditionally man has always blamed the devil, or "Satan" which means "enemy".. If you believe the Bible, one would have to believe that man is the source of evil, and good, as it was he who ate of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and promptly did his best to do all of what he had been warned away from (lie to God, hide in shame, blame others, etc.).. We still do eat of it, each morning, judging everything and everyone by the same standard we were warned from using.. Good luck with your diet, folks.  I've given it up.

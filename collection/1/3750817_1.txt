hi there,this is normal.there will be more suction the less petrol you have in ,am i right?this is probably becuase petrol is sucked from your tank for the engine.best practise is to always slowly unscrew your cap when filling.the fact that your tank is doing this shows that your petrol tank has a good seal too!.x

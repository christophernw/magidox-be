Since you are asking, I am going to assume that you have never done heads on a car before.  I would recommend that you not do it as most likely you don't have the required know how or tools.  One thing done incorrectly and you will be starting over.  Take it to someone that knows what they are doing.. . I am not saying this to be mean, just watching out.

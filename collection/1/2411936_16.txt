I think Christians protest for the same reason non-Christians do.  They disagree with ideas.  The biggest problem I see with it is when they use God as an excuse, and can't admit they personally have issue with what they are protesting.  As far as bagging on other religions, I don't feel that true Christians, who are where they need to be on a spiritual level do.  I think it's those who are insecure in, ignorant of, and caught up in the "religion" instead of Christianity.  Just my opinion....

You need an old fashioned match. They burn when exposed to air and are covered in wax.. . Modern safety matches are pretty much the only thing you can get these days for obvious reasons! Old fashioned matches weren't the safest things to carry around.. . The old ones can also be seen in western films, where the guys light them on their boots.. . Safety matches can be struck on a glass window - just hold it tightly against the window and slide fast enough to generate some heat, and presto!

I have to laugh everytime a Republican points to something that has to do with nothing, and act like it "proves" something. . . "Hey, Abu Abbas is in Iraq. There's that terrorism link Bush was talking about.". . "Hey, we found some 20 year old munitions. There's that weapons program Bush was talking about.". . Let's make it simple. Saddam was a bad guy, to most of his own people. But Bush lied to America about him being an imminent threat to America.. . Saddam killed thousands of his own people, but all of the mass graves right-wing idiots point to are from the periods when Saddam was fighting a virtual civil war. We don't say "Lincoln is evil, he killed hundreds of thousands of Americans", now do we? Bush Sr. promised we'd help overthrow Saddam. The people rose up, Bush did nothing, and Saddam quashed the insurgency. Does that make Saddam a good guy? No. But you at least need to have some f'n context.. . There are lots of bad guys in the world. I'm glad Saddam is out of power. But if Americans had been told before the war, "We're going to spend $300 billion to remove a bad guy who's not an eminent threat, and in the process, create (not stop, but CREATE) an entire generation of Iraqi terrorists, and fuel hatred of America throughout the Middle East and the world", no one in their right mind would have supported that course of action.

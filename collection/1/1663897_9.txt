Ok.... do the RIGHT THING and explain to your neighbour it was an ACCIDENT. even though the dog did mess up your car you have to realize that a pet like that to most people is considered a FAMILY MEMBER. You dont just go out and replace them. Dont try to go out and get back at him because whatever you do he will actually have real legal means to go after you.  He's causing a big fuss, he just needs to realize "Sh*t Happens". give him time to get over it.

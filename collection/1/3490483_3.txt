In the beginning of the Universe, all matter, ALL matter of the Universe was in a small region, and therefore, the pressure became highly intense while the volume became lower and lower (increasing pressure !), this resulted in the Big Bang. So I guess the answer for your question is, before the big bang, all the matter in the universe was getting compressed and therefore increased the pressure exerted by them outwards intensely. It is said that Big Bang launched the expansion of the universe, and some believe that the Universe is going to end with a "Big Crunch"

it is not how dumb but how stupid/ ininhibited your choices are.. . it only takes a few drinks to loosen the tongue that has remained silent for a long time.. . it depends on how much you have drunk, a scoial drinker will stop when they know they have had enough and will wake up fine the next morning.. . there are seom exceptions to the rule.. . a hangover can last most a of a day

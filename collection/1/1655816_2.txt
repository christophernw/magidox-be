Don't know at all about you - but I am mildly allergic to dust mites.. If I stayed in bed all day, especially if the humidity was high, I would get clogged sinuses from that allergy.. See if it happens when you have all fresh bedding, matress pad, pillow liner, sheets, blanket - bleach & hot water wash.  If not, consider allergies.

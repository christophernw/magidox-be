The list is endless! For me as a single parent it is also endless, but here are some of the top barriers for me. Lack of money, having to support dependants, working too many hours and not having enough study time,  commuting an hour each way three times a week year round, not being involved with campus activities so there is a disconnect from my peers, affordable safe and reliable childcare, fear of the unknown,  work simply being too hard, not having the necessary supplies to participate in class, problems with time management.

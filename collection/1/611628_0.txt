There is protein in their fecal matter and that is what attracts the dog to what I call "Kitty Treats".  The sense that protein and hummmmmm..Instant snack.  BLEACH!!!!!!. Try turning the boxes around so the dog can't get to them, or put them in a basement (what I had to do), on a shelf, or in a location the dog can't get into.

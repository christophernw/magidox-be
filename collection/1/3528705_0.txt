With fish you cannot tell the difference in males or females with betta fish they are different looking so the pet store knows which are females and which are males (BUT they have to know this because the males are mean and eat other males and females.  BUT, normally no there is no real way of telling the sex of a fish.  If you end up with lil baby fishys you will know ones a male and ones a female I suppose LOL.....

Have you ever gone to a doctor and NOT gotten a prescription?. . I'm so tired of doctors prescribing quick fixes for everyone and not CURING the problem. . . Did the doctor ask her about her lifestyle?  eating habits that may be contributing to her headaches?  Stress, hormones?. . Headaches are difficult to diagnose the cause, but it is your body telling you something is out of whack.. She needs to get a second opinion if her health really matters to her.  The side effects, current and future, are incredibly high.. . I believe it's job security for doctors NOT to cure- only to take care of the symptoms.

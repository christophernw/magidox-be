Actually all plastic is biodegradable, but it is VERY slow to biodegrade.  It degrades better chemically and through other physical processes such as being in sunlight...Plastic will biodegrade after it has gone through other processes over a long time in places like a landfill, and once enough of the chemical and/or physical bonds are broken down that way there are bacteria that love to devour petroleum based products, it just takes a while.

Do you mean typing with all capital letters?. . It's because it's hard to tell what emotion a person is feeling when they are typing a message. And over the last 10 years, more and more communication is over the computer and is just a few words typed. Different things have been used to show feelings and emotion when typing so that your audience understands if you're just kidding like  ;-) or  j/k. Or if you want to say your happy :-) or sad :-(  Sometimes you just want to emphasize a word. Like "I need it NOW!" . . Most people when they read an email from somebody can hear that person's voice in their head. And when you hit a word that all capitalized, you really emphasize it. But if they're all capitalized it sounds like somebody is shouting - and shouting is rude. . . DO YOU UNDERSTAND??? (see ... kinda sounds like shouting). . . Do you understand? (Much calmer and gentler when you use capitalization correctly.) . . Great Question - and Good Luck!

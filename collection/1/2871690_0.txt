A second cousin is one of your parents' cousins.  I've always considered mine to be more like aunts and uncles.  A fifth cousin is really removed, I don't think I know my fifth cousins.  My grandma told me during the olympcs a long time ago that one of the swimmers was my fourth cousin and I didn't know him at all.

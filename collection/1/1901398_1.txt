EXERCISE!!!! seriously... if that dosnt work by itself, change your diet too... you know what you should be eating... cut out the burgers and all the other crap from your every day diet. stick to salads, chicken, and fish. then make sure you excersise in the evening... jog a mile, do 25 push ups, 25 sit ups, take a hot shower, put on somethig really comfortable... then take a load off. if you still cant sleep, do all this, then crack open a book while listening to light classical music. this should put you right out. oh yeah, i almost forgot, just relax. if your stressed that will definatly keep you up. but seriously try all this, i promis it will work. the book and classical music are probably the easiest, excersise is just the most healthy method. well good luck, let me know if it works out...

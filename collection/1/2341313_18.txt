Your verse : John 9:39  . .   39Jesus said, "For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.". . Your verse :  II Corinthians 5:10. 10For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.. . Your verse : John 12:47.     . 47"As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it.. . . Jesus, in most religions, does not judge.  It is GOD who judges, but he does not only judge us for our sins, but for our good deeds too.  We all will be judged by GOD on the "Great Judgement Day."  . . The BIBLE is hard to understand when you read it alone.  Try going to church, or asking a pastor or other religious mentor to help you understand the bible.  You can't call the bible a contradiction if you are taking the words of Jesus out of context.  In John 9:39, if you read further, he is using a metaphor of being blind.  Those that can see, know that they are sinning.  Those who are blind, do not know the Father, therefor he wants them to see.  Those that can see, he he wants blind - meaning he wants them to be blind to the worldly or secular nature of humans and be godly people.  Not continue to sin.. . We are all sinners.  All you have to do is repent of your sins.  God won't even remember.  It's not like he's up there keeping score!  He is preparing a place for you at a fabulous feast.  . . Don't read to much into the Bible without guidance.  And if you read a verse, it usually helps to read the chapter before and after the verse in the bible.  It helps to understand what the whole story is.  . . If you need any help, contact me.  I hope you know my JESUS!

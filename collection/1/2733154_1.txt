I suspect that had you given in to your next-day cravings, you would be addicted as well.  It sounds as simple as willpower.  You recognize that you may become addicted, so you avoid doing the drugs too often.  However that doesn't mean that you won't one day find it hard to get away from.  How often is your recreational use?  If it is every weekend, you are already addicted.  Try going a weekend without it and you'll see.  . I suggest quitting that junk alltogether.  Use some softer, less addicting drugs, or have a drink to relax.  Your current "clarity" WILL give way to an addiction, it's a matter of time.  Help your friends quit that shit too, or you'll bound to get sucked into their world.... Good Luck...

I am not crazy about this idea.  The potential for abuse, obviously, is huge.  More over, it's a good way to draw the sort of attention that politicians typically try to avoid.  I will also say that finding people and shooting them is not typically our problem.  Attempting to behave like police so everyone gets happy-happy joy-joy feelings, thinks we're swell and loves us while we stand up the IA and IP is a bigger factor than anything else.  Iraq is basically a police action at this point.  We can do it, it's just doesn't play to our historic strength.  It would be a huge escalation and change in policy to start collaring citizens and killing people en masse.

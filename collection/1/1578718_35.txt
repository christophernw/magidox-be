i would be able to fly, and fly people with me, like carry them. i have always wanted to fly. i used to tell myself, "when i grow up i am going to invent wings that can make people fly." i am still considering it, because my wish is still alive. You should always follow your wishes, and if i ever do create it, i would be the happiest, if i even got close i would be the happiest.. . Watch the birds fly, feel the wind on your face by riding a motorcycle, or a bike, then think of both of those feelings, a million times better, THAT is how i imagine flying...

okay, you CAN'T take out the battery, it's like not possible :P. My iPod does that sometimes. the people at the store said it was because it was out of battery (despite the fact that it had half its battery before.. so i dont know) Just be patient, and charge it overnight, that usually makes mine revive itself.

Might be just a dream. We can't always control the sub conscious. On the other hand it might be related to some past abuse or current fear of abuse. Your friend may even be experiencing the remnants of a buried memory. . If she is suffering ill effects from this nocturnal visitation such as sleep deprivation, depression, or unusual fear she should consult a therapist. Maybe one who specializes in buried memory recovery through hypnotism.. Good luck

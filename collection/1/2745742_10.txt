The sea and lakes and rivers has all sorts of characteristics that mean you don't need to put those things in.  Firstly, the large surface area on the top helps to ensure adequate oxygen is in the water, as to do the plants in them.  Secondly, fish only live in a place where the temperature is right for them, so if you want tropical fish and you live in a cold place you will need a thermometer or your fish will not do well and probably die.  And yes, you need a filter because as said below, a tank is a stagnant pond, and something has to be there to keep the water clean.

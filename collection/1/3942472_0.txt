The story about the word being an acronym as you mentioned above is not true.  Apparently, the acronym explanation did not surface until about 1960, while the first known use of it was some time around the 1500s.  After reading a number of sources, which you can find by searching for the "etymology" of the word, it's not clear what the origin was.

You can gargle with peroxide and warm water 3 x a day that will help till you see a doctor. If it is a canker sore gargling is the best  thing you can do either with peroxide and warm water, or with salt and warm water. The salt and water will help to relieve the pain while the peroxide and water will keep it from spreading and help it to heal. Good luck and God Bless...

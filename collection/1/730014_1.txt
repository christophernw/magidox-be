Okay. This is how I was taught in school. First take the sale amount. Now multiply the amount of sales taxes (eg. 8%=.08) to the sale amount. Add the answer you come up with on that to the sale amount and that's what it will cost with taxes.. . eg. $10.00 * .08= .80.       $10.00 + .80= $10.80. . Hope I didn't confuse you. I'm sure there's an easier way, but this is how I learned it.

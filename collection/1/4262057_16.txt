Its funny how uneducated everyone is...on every topic..not just this one!!  The reason why there is a fight between The Jews and Arabs is...yes...from bible times...and yes..some of it has to do with land...but...the main reason the fighting ever started is because of the Jews...The Jews systematically killed and raped Arabs in the time of Exodus...thats a book in the bible...When they walked throught the desert for 40 years they did alot of terrible things...read your bible and you will see.

Wow what a topic?. First I want to thank meli312 for sharing.. . I have family that took 20 years before they would seek . help being they dont feel anything is wrong. Mental . illness is like a addiction, the person likes being manic. . They feel great but sometimes they can do some very strange,. dangerous things.. What I have read about most mental illness is a imbalance of. chemicals in the brain, either too much or not enough. In the . medical world today there is help for most, but always seek . medical help.

Obviously, none of you are from the south, or either just stupid. Anyway just to let you know, here in Mississippi, some blacks even sport the flag on their front porch. I know lots of blacks who were cotten tshirts and confederate shirts. It has nothing to do with racists and not every one in the south is a redneck, you moron. Although I will say that lots of people in the south ARE racists. Blacks hate whites and whites hate blacks, that my friend, is a fact. Just live in Mississippi a MONTH, you will see. Its terrible but the flag DOES NOT represent racism or soar losing. Its heritage.

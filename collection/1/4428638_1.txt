Nice Observation... :-) There might be many reasons to answer this..One way is that, it has been developed as a mannerism while greeting a person,its almost involuntary action which we do without much of thinking.Not only that but if we clearly note something, while shaking hands we can estimate the mood and confidence level of the person we meet..I have good experiences in observing this fact while offering a shake hand.

the best hamburgers ever made, but they are really small one bite and there gone. and they have holes in them cause they are steamed with onions and the taste is out of this world, they are mostly found in new jersey, conneticut, ohio, and new york city, and a few other states.and alot of people can eat about 10 sliders per sitting.

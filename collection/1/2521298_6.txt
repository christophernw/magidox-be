It may still happen.  My father told me of how, quite some time ago, his grandfather was "filled with the Holy Spirit" and stood up during worship and started speaking in some unknown language (which purportedly sounded similar to Yiddish).  I wouldn't expect my father to lie about something like that; he's not a religious zealot and when he does lie he quickly admits that he was joking.. . I don't have a personal opinion on it and would probably be skeptical even if I saw it in person.

Traditional religious literature tends to refer to god as male primarily because males are more dominant and since god is the supreme being he should not be classified as female.. . If you are looking for a more practical interpretation, then you should assume god has no gender, neither male nor female. We tend calssify everything in life. . In school we are taught about solids, liquids, gasses in chemistry.. . We classify people by age, gender, color, ethnic background etc. The question is do we need to classify god even though we do not know what god looks like?! I would say no, because god is a supreme being and we can not even start to imagine his physical appearance should he have one.

on the outside they said that the real purpose was to remove Saddam from power (as he is a war criminal and a threat to global security), free the iraqi people as tey were being treated badly by him and to destroy the WMDs in iraq. However, up till today they still have not found any WMDs there nor any proof that WMDs were manufactured in iraq. It is now belived that those reasons are just a cover up. Also, the way the soldiers treat the iraqis puts doubt in ones mind as that certainly isnt the way to liberate the people. The real reason is believed to be oil. the price of oil was increasing and america needed more control over oil recources. It is also believed that G.Bush needed to show that he was indeed takin measures against terrorism as the media was reporting how he failed the country on numerous occasions such as 9/11 and this would help raise his status again. But for all we know he might just not like iraqis. Hope this helps.

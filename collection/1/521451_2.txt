If you can, bend forward (try not to break your back...). If you cannot, do the best you can (really hard, but again, don't break your back) for 10 seconds, twice a day, for a month - and then you'll succeed.. And if you only want to touch your toes, not to be in better shape - just lie down and position yourself in the "embryo posture".

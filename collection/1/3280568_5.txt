Reflects heat back into the flask rather like light would reflect back from a shiny surface. . Heat warms up the surface and the surface emits infra red energy outwards and this energy emitted takes the warmth out of the food inside the flask. The mirrored surface inside the glass reflects this energy back into the flask and retains the heat in the flask to keep food warm. It also keeps heat coming into the flask so keeps food cold too.

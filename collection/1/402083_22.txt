Wow this is SO my question. I'm poor by most people's standards, I don't have a lot of "stuff", never have had. But I still donate a lot to charity. I really got into this during Hurricane Katrina. I just ask myself, "Would this mean more to someone else than it does to me?" And if it's yes, then you give it up. . I went to N.O. with the Red Cross, and saw people who had lost everything, and it's how I knew how very little I needed just to be happy. . "You gotta give it up if you wanna get it back".

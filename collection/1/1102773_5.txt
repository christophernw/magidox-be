To seek God in all things. . You are now a child of God, and you can speak with Him on a daily basis, no formal prayers, but just letting your heart speak.  . . Letting time alone for God, so He can speak to you too.. . To understand the sacrifice that Jesus made for you by dying on the cross. . To realize that heaven is a free gift when you accepted Jesus into your heart. . To celebrate the resurrection of Jesus like you've never celebrated before!! (it's not just on Easter, but a celebration of life)

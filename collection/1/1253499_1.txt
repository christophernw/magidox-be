if you have a car in your name, you have to get it registered and insured in the state of Mississippi before you can get a license in the state b/c in most states it's illegal to have a driver's license from one state and plates from another state.  I don't know for sure what Mississippi's laws are, but you find out by calling the DMV or court house in your county.  I went through the same thing when I moved from MI to TX.

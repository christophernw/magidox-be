I love Advil Migraine...I haven't tried Excedrin...pop two of them and go lay down!. . However, if a nap is not an option (if I'm at work for instance), I try to get my hands on some Advil/Motrin/generic ibuprofen, a cup of coffee and some dark chocolate.  I find the caffeine really helps.  In some people though, caffeine triggers migraines.  It all depends on your body's reaction.. . However, the worst migraines I've had cannot be relieved with caffeine.  They require quiet with eyes closed in at least partial darkness for a good half hour to an hour at least to lessen symptoms.

soot is present because there is incomplete combustion, in combustion hyrdocarbons react with oxygen to form carbondioxide gas plus other compounds depending on their chemical  composition. when the air hole of say a bunsen burner is open, and the airlow is efficient almost all the hydrocarbons which are mostly of this form (CHn)m, where m and n are intergers decompose to form carbondioxide. when closed the combustion is incomplete and and soot is a product of inefficient combustion.

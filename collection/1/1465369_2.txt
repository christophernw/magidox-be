Well, I feel that anyone is capable of learning things if they want to, so I would say it is more of a personal choice. I know some people have more difficulty in areas then others, but you still have to practice and study in order to learn material. I am sure there is one area you are good in, you just may not have found it yet because you have such a negative attitude about yourself.

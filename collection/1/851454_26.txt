I smoke because I saw my big brother smoking and thought he was cool so I wanted to try it. The I was dating a guy who smoked when I was 15 and I wanted him to like me so I took it up then I had friend's who smoked so I just went along. Now I'm 23 and wish I didn't cause I can't seem to quit. I hate smoking.

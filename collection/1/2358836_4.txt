Interesting question:. . I think it is becoz there is always a difference between fresh and an experienced person. An experienced is mature in many terms especially when come to commetments and meeting dead lines. . One more link to that may be coz nowadays in business one of the major concerns is employs attitude (you can include mental and social stability for consistant performance)  towards work and it surely comes from work and experience. And i think its easy to find out the state of experienced folks then fresh blood. so low risk with high rewards....

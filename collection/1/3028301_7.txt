One of the best places to go is your local food advisors for answers to this question.  I know in WA state we go through the WSU sponsored Food Advisors board.  They sponsor all sorts of publications as well as having a help line to answer different questions.  However, all of your answerers have it right, ESPECIALLY because of the dairy in it, it will have spoiled enough that probably won't even taste any good, let alone having bad bacteria in it.

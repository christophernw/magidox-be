America is rich for a variety of reasons but principally because it was the first nation to create a liberal democratic society that was relatively free from class restrictions, generally secular, in which government did not act as a check against economic development, that promoted public education, and extolled social mobility. . . All of which permitted a relatively free market to create a innovative, highly motivated and industrial society. . . Moreover, most of the great innovations of the modern era have their genesis in the United States. Other nations may have contributed bits and pieces of various inventions that dominate modern life but the overwhelming majority are American. . . Just think of the things that are American inventions or discoveries. Electricity, sound recording, movies, the transistor, the computer, mass production, airplanes, the internet, and television are just a few. . . Yes, you can claim that this or that Russian or Frenchmen or whatever REALLY invented this or that but, oddly enough, these things first spread in daily use from the epicenter of scientific creativity in the world, to wit, the United States. . . Throughout the 20th century American, a single country, produced the majority of all internationally recognized patents. In that same period, American had the type of free economy that allowed such inventions to grow into industries. . . THAT"S why the USA is so rich.

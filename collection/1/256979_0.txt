I suppose the real question is whether you want a job or a career.... . ANYONE can get a job, especially when it comes to stuff like flipping burgers. A career is a different kind of work: it is your committment to a body of work that will enable you to use your skills and talents and be happy (most all of the time). A career can allow for advancement (unless you go into business for yourself and be your own boss). A job will always find you cornered, unable to move upward, and begging for a raise. You will be nothing more than frustrated with "just a job".. . The first bit of advice I have for you (and probably the most important) is to look into the companies themselves. Do not respond to emails soliciting you. This is called "fishing". Go find the people you want to work for! Make contacts. Listen or ask friends and family to keep their ears open for things you are interested in. Follow-up on every opportunity. You never know if it will turn out to be what you're looking for.. . Find jobs and careers you have a genuine interest in (i.e., publishing). [Sorry, just pulled that one out of a hat]. Then find [in this example] publishing companies who have consistently produced good work. Do your research. Contact them. Take the initiative. Don't wait for them to contact you.. . The genuine job openings ones won't ask for your money, or ask you to work at home calling other people for free. Scammers will find a way to get their hands on your money.. . It's best, if you have the resources, to do research on the company, even if it means contacting the Better Business Bureau.. . Remember, you don't pay to get a job, you get paid to do a job.. . Best of luck and happy hunting!

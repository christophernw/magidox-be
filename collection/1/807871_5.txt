Some (NOT ALL) get offended easily when you point out discrepancies in their belief.  They feel that we are attacking them, when we are just sharing our own personal knowledge.. . I think that these few people just get frustrated and confused, and then they take it out on us.  . . They later say that we are forcing our "non-beliefs" down their throats.. . It's a huge circle, it never ends, and I now have a headache!  :)

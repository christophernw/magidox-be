try putting it into a microwave for a few three minutes first,then wrap in tin foil.probably 25minutes on grill and to the side of grill.to test when done,stick a fork through the potato and check if easy to poke,then it is done.. p.s. don't forget to poke some holes in the potato before microwaving.

Suppose its partly to do with that film, jingle all the way, man that was good. its to make sure you get what you need before they lower their prices so you lose more money. i know theres longer queues at christmas but its to save that extra tenner to get a movie to watch. Sorry, was just rambling. anyways i think its still stupid. And argos is stupid for selling the early Xmas tinsel. (Expression)

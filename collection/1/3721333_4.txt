A lot of men like bigger women.  The problem is that they are ashamed to be seen with them in public because we live in a society that hates fat people, although it's made up of fat people.. My overweight friends all date black guys, who seem to like their women super-sized and aren't ashamed of it.. As men get older, they seem to relax their social standards a little and start dating larger women.  Some guys that I've known since high school who never would have dated a "fat chick" back then go out with heavier women all the time now.  Some of them still won't date an overweight woman.. I believe it's the last bit of allowed discrimination. If a child said something about a person's race the parent would apologize and reprimand the child.  But if that same child makes a remark about someone being fat, it's okay.  I know this because I am very overweight and children are known to say "mommy why is that lady so fat?" and the parents don't say anything, just look away from me like nothing happened.

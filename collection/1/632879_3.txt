I read that it takes a straight shift car and you have to have a certian amount of gas with a certain amount of clutch. When its right all you have to do is press on the gas and the wheels spin with almost no traction. Pair this with sliding downhill sideways and you've got a drift. Basically it's a controlled spinout going sideways... think of it as fishtailing except instead of you having no traction from slamming on the brakes, you have no traction because your tires are spinning out.

You may have a bad intake or head gasket, the white smoke is because you have antifreeze leaking into your cylinders. The gas smell may be a leak in the fuel line or in the throttle body. I would suggest that you go to the local parts store and get a haynse repair manual for the year and make of your car it will cost you about 15 to 20 $ for the book. hope this helps.

If you know of any illegal immigrants, report them to the local police so the ball is in their court to take the appropriate action.  Go to work, or go to the store like it was any other day.  If you try to go somewhere and see protesters, ignore them.  If any people are protesting and try to harass you, have them arrested for harassment.  Remember, it is their right to PEACEFUL protest, NOT to become violent or harass others.

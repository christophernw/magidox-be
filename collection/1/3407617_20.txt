The only way a man/women would defend prostitution, is because they walk around thinking it is a skill, or a job.    This type of a career leads to much un-happiness and illness.   Any man/women can do this !   Anyone who wants to use the private area with no shame, instead of the brain, can do it.   I don't mean to  judge  your opinion, but this is mine and many other peoples too.  You think prostitution is a talent ??   Ha ha what a laugh.   any women can spread their legs and do it.    But then we fall into the word shame.   Some have no shame.   They think it is great to sell their hind end for little and nothing.   Then do you stop to think what prostitution does to  marriages ?   It cause adulterous break-ups, and in the olden days it causes a lot of syphillis cases.   Many miners and men who traveled away  from home to work, would engage in sex for money only to end up with syphillis and bring it home to his wife and children.   Do you really think this is talent ?    Why can't you use your skills to make money ??    Your  intelligence has got to be better then that.   To use you hind  end as a skill ?      Don't compare  your sinful life to that of Jesus !!  It says in the Holy Bible a once  clean man,  who leaves the house of a prostitute, will walk away, never to be clean again.       So if you think prostitution is a talent and a skill, boy you sure have found a way to defend  yourself.       When any decent man finds out your a prostitute, he will never want you.    What I think of a prostitute is similar to a garbage can.    The men will put debre into your garbage can , leave their stink in your garbage can and then walk away.    Yah , right  , that is really talent and a skill !!!   Figure it out.

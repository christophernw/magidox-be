This is one of the main verses that points to that theory.  . . 1st Corinthians 15:51-53 (this is the King James Version). 51Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, .  52In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. .  53For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.. . Vs. 51 says "We shall not all sleep"  read that as we shall not all die.  That would indicate that there are those living who will be changed instantly into spirit.  The passage also goes on to indicate that the dead shall be resurrected at this time as well.

Because the name "yahweh" was supposed to be so holy that it was not supposed to be spoken or written except by the very purest of people.  If you look in the back of most bibles, a reference or glossary, you usually will find the name.  Some religions also believe that only those who know the true name of God, "Yahweh" will be admitted into heaven and therefore it is a conspiracy to not use it.

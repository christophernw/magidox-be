Ask her to respect you and not mention her God so much. . If you're truly friends you can both compromise and meet somewhere in the middle. Set a time, or a limit about when she can talk about God, you don't have to believe it but it may make her feel better if someone will listen and understand that it's what makes up a part of her life. As long as she understands that you need some non-God time too.

the fact that you have been doind the same routine for 7 yrs doesnt help your diet. check for thyroid condition and change up your diet. Eat something else, do a different exercise. change it up for a bit and maybe you'll see a change. dont take any diet pills... they do help but after you stop you gain the weight again. Exercise frequently (diff things every other day) and eat in moderation.

The "loss" of Vietnam was mainly due to poor tactics.  very briefly,   in order to win any war you have to take and control land.  Since Vietnam was not fought as a traditional war the United States went to a "Fire Base" centric tactics.  This meant that US Troops left the base on missions to search and derstroy the enemy and once their mission was done returned to the fire base.  This allowed the enemy to reoccupy the areas that were just "destroyed."  This meant the war was a battle of attrition and when you are not willing to let hundreds of thousands of troops die and your enemy is, you will never win.

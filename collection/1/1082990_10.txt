Black snakes aren't too bad, their bite's pretty nasty but they'll generally leave you alone and keep out of your way. If this isn't the case it's probably because there's a nest somewhere in or near your yard.. First of all ring up your local hospital which might want a few of them to milk to develop antivenom. You can take care of them yourself easy enough, just wear something protective over your legs and make sure you have a family member looking on to ring for an ambulance (Red belly blacks are lethal, fortunately no-one has died in Australia from snake bite for quite some time due to the hospitals being well stocked with antivenom).. If you have issues with killing them get in someone from the various wildlife conserves and national parks to remove them for you.. If you kill them, black snake meat is very tasty so don't just chuck away the carcasses

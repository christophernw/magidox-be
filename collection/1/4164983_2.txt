if you have a usb connector for both phones you can use your computer and a program called bitpim. check to see if your phone is supported by the program. . or go to this site mbuzzy.com upload your songs and games pics then send them to the other phone. . . if not use bluetooth or re-download them to the new phone.... good luck

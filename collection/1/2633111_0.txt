It's an old folk saying that means that if your ox (bull) is winning a battle with my bull, you will think everything if fair and just, but if your ox (bull) is loosing, you will think something should be done to correct the situation. So when people or their allies are winning, they think everything is fair and proper, but when they loose they want investigations, rule changes, fines, imprisonment, impeachment, against the other persons.

Gleeful? No. Anticipatory? Most likely. I for one am tired of seeing Israel getting tossed to and fro by all the nations. I wish for the day when Yeshua saves Israel and reveals His hands to them.. . Wrath-I can see your confusion at this emotion, it has quite a bit to do with what has happened inside of us. When Jesus comes in, it is like a breath of fresh air and living crystal clear water to a parched soul. It is so good that many new Christians become so crazy with excitement that they appear like nuts oft times. If this is what being born again is like, what will it be like in the fulfillment. So they project forward, past Revelation 4-18 right into Revelation 19. It will be a glorious day, a day of recreation and renewal. Christ will take the throne at last and Israel will recognize her Messiah. However, many Christians (and I have fallen into this euphoria) seem to miss a warning in Amos 5:18 . . "Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.". . So really, you are correct. It is like Jonah, because of his hatred for Nineveh, waited for God to rain fire upon them.. . That is why I am in anticipation, but not gleeful, because at that time Satan will be allow full access to deceive the nations, and many believers will be slaughtered for their faith and many Jews will be killed in a horrible new persecution. So much so that they will need to flee to Jordan for refuge. It will not be a happy time, but it is easy to skip ahead and see how it all turns out.

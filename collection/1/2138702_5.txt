One can only assume that he had to wait until after the election to know for sure that the Dems would take control of 1 or both Houses of Congress.. . This is because if more Dems than Repubs won, there would be too much politicking and gridlock between the Secretary and Congress, but if the Repubs stayed in power even barely, he might have stayed on at least til the end of the year or even until Bush is out of office.

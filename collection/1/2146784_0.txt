ok well this is how i would answer that. . . "well little brother when a young  girl chicken loves a boy chicken he whips his little "tic-tac" out and strick it in the gilr chickens "oven" but before he does that he puts a rubber...or a glove on his "tic-tac" so that way the "tic-tac" doesnt throw up in the oven and so there arent little baby chickens getting cooked and popping out of the oven."

fermentation is the process by which some types of microorganisms (like yiest) use monosacchaide (like glucose) as nutrint and porduce metabolite and CO2  by oxidising it partially and release partial energy.. the diff between glycolysis and fermentation is that -----. in glycolysis glucose is fully oxidised and produce complete energy wich is greater than energy released in fermentation. moreover in fermentation carbohydrate is partially oxidised

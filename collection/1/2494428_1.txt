It is best to read Publication 972 (link below).  There are certain guidelines to be met to qualify.  For example, for tax year 2005:. . The maximum amount you can claim for the credit is $1,000 for each qualifying child. . . Qualifying Child. A qualifying child for purposes of the child tax credit is a child who: . . Is your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of them (for example, your grandchild), . . Was under age 17 at the end of 2005,. . Did not provide over half of his or her own support for 2005,. . Lived with you for more than half of 2005. (see Exceptions to “time lived with you” condition below), and . . Was a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national, or a resident of the United States. If the child was adopted, see Adopted child below. . . . For each qualifying child you must either check the box on Form 1040 or Form 1040A, line 6c, column (4), or complete Form 8901 (if the child is not your dependent). . . Adopted child.   An adopted child is always treated as your own child. An adopted child includes a child lawfully placed with you for legal adoption. . .   If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. national and your adopted child lived with you all year as a member of your household in 2005, that child meets condition (5) above to be a qualifying child for the child tax credit. . . Exceptions to “time lived with you” condition.    A child is considered to have lived with you for all of 2005 if the child was born or died in 2005 and your home was this child's home for the entire time he or she was alive. Temporary absences for special circumstances, such as for school, vacation, medical care, military service, or business, count as time lived with you. . .

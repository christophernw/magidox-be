Put a little bit of Peroxide in her ear for a few minutes with her head turned to the side, it will sound and feel funny, but it will break the wax loose, then turn her head in the other direction to drain, use Q-tip to clean when the peroxide & loose wax has drained. The sore throat could be from sinus drainage, she should be seen by the doctor for that.

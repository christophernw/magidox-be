I don't know why it's still a problem.  Just because a few idiots crashed planes into the WTC doesn't mean the whole race should be blamed for it.  (just like w/ any other race...just cause a few idiots are being stupid doesn't mean the whole race is like that.)  Besides, isn't the war supposed to be on Terrorism and not Middle Eastern people?

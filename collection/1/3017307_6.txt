you're right they should like me as well. i'm plannin to get one after sony see's it's sales are horrible and drops the freakin price 200 bucks down. i read that one man was shot because he didn't give up his money for it.people were trampled down mostly at every store just to get a damn ps3.some didn't even get a ps3 they were thinkin that the stores might might have extras,but no they didn't.so i laugh at them.so go get a wii instead.and thats the final word.

They usually are there to invite you to their Church in your neighborhood.. . Giving you a chance to fellowship w/them and know who they are so you will not be too ignorant of your neighbors.. Letting you know they are there IF you need: a handout, other help, religion in your life.. Churches are missionaries in your world/neighborhood.. . It's our money that send them overseas.  God says to "Go into all the world preaching the Gospel, baptizing them in the name of THE Father, Son and Holy Ghost.". Can we disobey God?  Do you think they are there by chance?. . They may be the ONLY one who care about you.. . Yes, there are good and bad, you can weed 'em out.  Just see where they put Jesus.  Is He a brother, good man or God?. . Like Peace.......give them a chance.

Tests cannot be biased against a race or a culture.  They can be biased against a specific person.  I am fat.  A test that includes athletic prowess can be biased against me. A written test in swahili might be considered biased against a french-only person.  Put me on a diet the bias goes away.  Teach the frenchie swahili and the bias goes away.

The best way I found is before going to bed drink lots of water 4 to 6 glasses and take two pain relievers. First this will help with the hangover and second you will peee a way alot of the alcohol.  In the morning if you have access to a suana or stream room use it or go for a good run to help sweat out more alcohol.  shower with a good deorderant soap, brush your teeth. Thats the best way I know of

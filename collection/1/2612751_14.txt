We use Science Diet Sensitive Stomach Formula.  We started out using Nutro Max Puppy, and our poor pup was just randomly getting sick - constantly eating grass and spitting up stomach acid.  The vet attributed it to a food allergy or a sensitive stomach.  Ever since we switched to the Science Diet, we haven't had a problem!  We still use Nutro treats though!

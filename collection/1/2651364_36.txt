Telling him to F off was not exactly the best way of handling it. But he was at fault too. As a christian, one of my objectives is to turn people on to christ as it is the same to many other christians(the great comission). Some christians just have a bad way to go about it that leave a bad taste in the mouths of non believers. I think it was inappropriate of him to pry into your beliefs if it bugged you.

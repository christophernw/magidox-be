Well Im growing up but being a teenager was fun! I wasnt into drugs but just a little drinking. Not to where I would get messed up! But just able to feel it. I would say the best part is having friends going out with them all the time and sharing memories! Some people say highschool was the worst! But its what you make of it.. dont let people control your life. well your parents are a part of that till your 18 respect your elders but go out wild and crazy but be safe

Let's blame both.  Sure, in corporate america "it's all about the money", but illegals coming in also know they are doing something wrong in the way they are coming into this country.  it's the chicken and egg all over again, which came first?  Both perpetuate the problem.  Fixing the problem should involve both issues....stop illegals from entering AND heavily fine and bring criminal charges against businesses hiring illegals.

First of all...go to the pet store and invest in a house training book as there are several methods to try to get your dog house trained.. Next put some vinegar in with the carpet cleaner soap you are using. The vinegar will neutralize the pet urine. It is very important that you get rid of the scent where your dog is going in the house as these spots are sent marks and your dog will return to them to urinate again in these same spots.

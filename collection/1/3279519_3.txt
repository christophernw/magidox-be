First you need to talk to your doctor.  Not all depression is something you can control...sometimes it can be the result of a chemical imbalance in your system that you may need medication to correct.   . . Exercise,  good nutrition,  a good schedule schedule of rest (at least 8 hours) and sunlight will also help. Stay away from caffeine,  alcohol, cigarettes and other drugs.  Meditation,  writing about how you feel,  there are many avenues for you to explore and some will take more time than others to effect change.  Best wishes....

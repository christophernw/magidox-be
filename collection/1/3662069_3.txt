Perfection is impossible accomplishment by any human being.  Jesus was the only one that was able to do this. We are commanded to love our wives and husbands but not just go out and have sex with anyone we want.  Jesus didn't because that wasn't a part of Gods plan, he was here to redeem the world of its sins, not to marry and have children.  Yes you can change your values so in your own eyes you may seem perfect but then you will have to face God during judgment.  What he has told us what is write and wrong is what really is going to matter not what we chose to believe what was right and wrong.

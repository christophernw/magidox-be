For me. . The Bible is true because everyday it proves itself true. I see Gods Word in lots of different areas and arenas of my life. I don't really look for it, it just comes, it just is.... I read something or learn something in Bible, and then something will come along and confirm it(what I read), it is really wild, weird, and astounding some times. That is what makes it true to me.  I have read lots of other books, some claiming to be factual, and have never had them prove themselves.. . I know of no other book, that has survived so long, that has been read by so many, or that is hated so much... the hate is the sure sign here, why would people hate something so much if it were not true, why would they fight it so, and try for so long to disprove it.  Look at Darwin, they did not even fight that long about his stuff, already Science, itself, is disproving Darwin theories.

very sad about your friend. we all have a choice in life. to do good or not. your friend choose to do heroin. maybe  her body could not handle it or she had too much. do not blame any one else. He cries Himself at the lose of so much potential  and waste of such a precious gift, life. do not let anger and sadness  push you away from God, draw near and receive His love and healing.

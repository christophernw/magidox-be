by everynight do u mean your horse has no access to water during the day? if so then that is your problem right there.... . if your has alwasy has water then you need to call your vets office, let him know all your horses symptoms, and if they feel its needed they will come out, in the meantime, try to collect a sample of the urine for your vet, put a cup on the end of a stick then refridgerate it until they get there.

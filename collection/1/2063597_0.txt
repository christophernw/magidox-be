Bread is the traditional food of choice when feeding ducks at the park but I guess this would be more healthy for them;. . "Mallards are primarily vegetarians who eat various seeds including corn, wheat, barley, bulrushes, wild rice, primrose, willow, seeds of water elm, oak, hackberry and other trees of swamps or river bottoms. Mallards will also eat some mollusks, insects, small fish, tadpoles, freshwater snails and fish eggs."

Because it is an auto immune disorder. The pain you can feel from this disease gets aggravated by movement so it seems to be work related but that pain is a symptom of the illness. Please go to this site to learn more about your illness and I wish you all the best. . . Also, get a really good Immunologist instead of a regular physician. He or she will understand what you are going through much better. . . GOOD LUCK!

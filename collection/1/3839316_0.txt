Yes there is a "super HD" system under development, but no-one expects it to replace consumer HD for some time, if ever.  (It is being developed for medical and scientific uses.)  As with all improvements like this, there is a law of diminishing returns.  The better a system is, the harder it is to make significant improvements, and the cost of those improvements keeps increasing.  Many people feel that the improvement from ordinary TV to HDTV is only incremental and some don't even appreciate the difference.  It will be even harder to see the difference in "super HD" and it will cost a whole lot more.  We are more likely to see technology improvements within the current HD standards: better displays, lower cost displays, etc.

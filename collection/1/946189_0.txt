When you use the calling card, it has its own number, so even if she or he has you as a friend in their contacts list, the number will not correspond and they will not know it is you calling.  The only way a name shows up is if it is a registered number with your name as the holder, or if the number called has your name stored with it.  If it comes up blocked number then it is because your telephone number is blocked and the phone will not recognize you calling.

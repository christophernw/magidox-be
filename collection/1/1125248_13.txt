Darwin discovered that man has been the result of evolution of chimpanzees. The process of evolution from apes to mankind was very very slow. Darwin proved from DNA tests taken from chimpanzees and its comparison with man DNA Test results. Your second part of your question. Why there apes now in this world?. I am not biologist but I can say with confidence that there might be the process of evolution from apes to mankind must have been stopped and slowed down due to one reason to another. Now the creation of mankind is normally done with the union of man and woman. I am therefore inclined to say that Darwin theory of evoultion of mankind from chimpanzies appears correct.

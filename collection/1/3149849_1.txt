You do need help. The science project would involve measuring the temperature of the soda or water and observing what happens. You want to avoid the project, not help with the project.. . If you do the project, you should find the temperature of the soda going down. It will not go down past 32 degrees F. It will stay at 32 until the ice is gone. Then the temperature will increase to the temperature of the air around it.. . Incidentally, if you open a room-temperature bottle or can of soda (carefully, over a sink), measure the temperature of the soda as soon as you can. The reason soda was created was to cool the soda by the evaporation of the gas in it, before refrigerators and readily available ice.

Firstly, how on earth would a bean get lodged in your nose and secondly DO NOT attempt to lodge AAA batteries up it either (or anything else for that matter)  But seeing as you have, you could try covering the other nostril and blowing your nose to dislodge the aforementioned article.  Try also to make yourself sneeze, then blast it out but for gawds sake make sure there's nobody standing infront of you at the time.  Hope this helps!  (a bean??????!, lol)

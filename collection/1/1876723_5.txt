In a previous era, 14 and 15 year olds getting married wasn't uncommon in parts of the USA (if not the entire thing at one time or the other).. . However, She had sex with a person who was under her power, her control.  She was his teacher.  This is the aggravating factor, making it a lot more than just a case of someone being too young.. . In addition, a 13 year old has no business having sex.  Even if their body is ready to go, you can bet that their emotions and life skills are nowhere close to handling the responsibilities and stresses of having sex.  The vast majority of people who have sex at that age, ESPECIALLY with a trusted adult, are profoundly damaged psychologically.

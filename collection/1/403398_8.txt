Try Lithium, Klonapin, Valium, Nortriptyline, Amitriptyline, Butalbitol you name it, I got a pharmacy in my cupboard.  These stupid doctors just keep giving me more drugs.  I wish they would find a cure instead of just treating the symptoms.. . But on a more serious note, have you tried deep breathing exercises?  When you focus on your breathing, it tends to calm the clatter of the mind.  Take a deep breath in while you count to 5 then out counting to 5 as well.  Breathe from the diaphragm.  Your stomach should go in and out when you breathe, not your chest.

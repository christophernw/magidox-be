One of the things ive noticed it there is a bit of latent dysfunction in that it further perpetuates some levels of intolerance in society - religion section. Though there are many people meeting with likeminded ideas, these groups are not really using much of a respectful dialogue with each other (not that they always do outside of yahoo answers). But i think its interesting that a lot of people are coming in with questions about race (many misguided about what race is) and religion and are being turned away probably more confused or upset than when they first got on site.

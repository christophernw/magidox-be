Most Christian denominations differ on minor issues.  The real Christian churches agree that the only way to go to Heaven is by having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior.  All of these other differences are meaningless and I look forward to the day when God brings us all together  so that we can glorify Him as one body of believers.

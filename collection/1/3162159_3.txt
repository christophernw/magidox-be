I would have to agree it partialy depends on where you want to live.  But for the most part electronics, coputer and chemical are in the highest demands.  However, you really should be thinking about what your talents are and what you really want to be spending your life doing.  . . If you go to a good school and do well any engineering feild will pay pretty well.  Of course some pay better than others.  After working several years at various engineering jobs that I hated I can tell you that looking forward to work each day is worth more to me than I ever thought.. . To sum it all up: Look at your skills and interests to determine the best engineering field for you, go to a good school, work hard and be creative, and then find work that you find interesting and exciting.

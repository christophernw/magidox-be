What exactly were the charges?  I was a bit of a 'rowdy' teenager and told my recruiter everything; all I had to have to join up was a 'morals waiver' and that's it.  My advise is be honest because the job you get after basic training could require a Top Secret security clearance in which case you'll be found out and in deep sh*t; trust me getting kicked out would suck a whole lot more than having to wait a few extra month for a waiver...nearly everything is waiverable in the military...

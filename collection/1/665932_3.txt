You need to start today. Start by changing the way you eat. Your diet is everything in regaining your life. Next, come up with a workout routine that involves both cardio and weight training. Do them on opposite days not all at once. Keep your body focused on nutrition and exercise and it will start responding positively and repairing itself. Also, you will feel a better buzz, a healthy one.

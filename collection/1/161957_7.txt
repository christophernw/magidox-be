Tuition: I guess you mean the costs to homeschool in High School...this varies depending on the program you use, there are correspondence courses, plain curriculum (books/quizzes), Videos classes and also over the internet. I taught 2 daughter thru High School on approximately $200 a year.. Time: I looked at what average High Schools teach and devised my own batch. This I divided evenly thru the year. I also had more hours spent per week on English, Math and Sciences, and less spent on Art or Sports for example. We started around 8/9 and went thru 2 or so. We did some Saturday work sometimes, we did lots of trips. We also traveled. I worked the schedule around these trips.. Cooking: is learned by doing. Simply show them and have them try recipes for the family, they can learn to budget grocery money and how to calculate for 6 people.... CV are easy as you will be first creating a transcript and also a Diploma, just like other schools. This can go in their CV, be sure that they have "outside" involvement that would be good for the CV, ie: volunteer work at the hospital, shelter or community organisation. You may add outside courses for variety, yoga, karate, violin, sign language, first aid, etc. . The best place to get help is thru homeschool books, also thru the HSLDA, and your local library. JOin a homeschool group in your state, and in your locale. Being around other homeschoolers will help you to "know" more. There are homeschool fairs, that exhibit homeschool materials, go there and soak up all that info, take a bunch of free catalogs and samples!. . Both my daughters were homeschooled since the 4th grade, thru HIgh School, the youngest is taking the MCAT this summer for medical school. She has had zero issues adjusting.. It can be done!

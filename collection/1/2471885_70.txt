The definitions you referred to are not quite identical in my dictionary (encarta). It states that apprehension is the ability to grasp the IMPORTANCE, SIGNIFICANCE, or MEANING of something, while comprehension is defined as the ability to grasp the MEANING of something only. I would view apprehension as a position on the weight of something in the big picture of immediate or distant future, while comprehension deals with the ingredients and not the big picture, relative to life. While apprehension does include "meaning" in it's definition, I would think that to simply view it as understanding the meaning only, would be using the wrong context and informalizing the formal definition of the word. Dictionary meanings are only effective because they are what general society understands a word to mean. You wouldn't ask someone if they "apprehend what you're saying", would you?

The proper translation would be: . . PICKTHAL: And when Moses asked for water for his people, We said: Smite with thy staff the rock. And there gushed out therefrom twelve springs (so that) each tribe knew their drinking-place. Eat and drink of that which Allah hath provided, and do not act corruptly, making mischief in the earth. . . and yes...mischief is hurting anything alive, and causing havoc in general.

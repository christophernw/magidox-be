Good question! Some people claim that we are no longer under the Law, but under Grace. But this verse would seem to indicate that the Law is established by faith.. . "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.". . I think it means we're still under the Law, and we're screwed if God decides to punish us for no longer following it to the letter.

An enemy combatant is someone that is being fought or just captured (not imprisoned).  A prisoner of war (POW) is some that has been captured and is being held prisoner.  The government that has POWs generally will notify the opposing government that the POWs exist and who they are (if known).  However, in some wars, the POWs are not reported to exist and thus the military must go in and find anyone that has not reported to his/her main unit.

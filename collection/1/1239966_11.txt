You are indeed using different muscles.  Curling involves primarily the bicep muscle as well as a little of your front deltoid and forearm (Depending upon how much body english you are using).. . The chin up involves a little of your bicep, but mostly it involves the latissimus muscle (the fan-shape muscle) on the sides of your back.  In addition, it uses your forearms, traps and rhomboids -- to a lesser degree.  It appears that your lats are underdeveloped or you are on the heavy side.  Generally, the heavier you are, the harder it is to do pull-ups.. . You and I are reversed.  My biceps are a bit on the weaker side, but I can crank out pull-ups / chin-ups fairly easily.  I weight around 160.. . Good luck.

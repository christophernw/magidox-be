NOFX LYRICS. . "Vegetarian Mumbo Jumbo". . I don't want tofu,. I'd rather have a mouthful of beef stew,. I don't want to be vegetarian,. Why eat beans when you can have steak instead?. . I don't feel bad about,. Eating something that's dead,. So why should I be sad,. For cows getting hit in the head?. So I like eating fish,. Tell me what's wrong with this,. How can you blame me,. For eating chicken of the sea?. . Don't waste your breath yelling at me,. About animal rights,. And how they should be free,. 'Cos it's survival of the fittest,. And we're winning.. . I don't feel bad about,. Eating something thats dead,. So why should I be sad,. For chickens being force fed,. So I like eating fish,. Tell me what's wrong with this,. How can you blame me,. For eating chicken of the sea?

People think that summer is the worse for fleas, but these pesky things are year round. Revolution topical fleas,tick, mosquito, ear mite, and all worms except tape. It will also take care of heartworms. I can not rave on this product enough. Get it at vet/ or animal shelter. It is once a month and I have had great results as far as the cats coat being thicker, healthy shinny after just a few months applications.

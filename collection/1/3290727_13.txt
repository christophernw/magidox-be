The obviously permanent solution would be to have him declawed. Contrary to some people's beliefs, it does NOT make all cats "mad" or whatever...mine was declawed a couple of months ago and couldn't be happier. Since the nail caps are out of the question, blocking him off from the area might be a temporary solution, since the water and other negative punishment treatments probably wont' be very helpful in your quest to gain kitties trust.

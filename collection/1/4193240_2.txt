Desi (pronounced ˈd̪e:si or ˈd̪e:ʃi, and alternatively spelled Deshi), is a term used by South Asians to refer to themselves (in a manner that avoids any allusion to the specific state of origin and pointing to a common broader identity). This is also the name of the subculture found amongst the South Asian diaspora (see Indian diaspora).. . South Asia (the Indian subcontinent) refers to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, but the diaspora spreads throughout the world, with large communities in Fiji, Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritius, South Africa, the Arabian Gulf, Guyana, Suriname, the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, and many other places.

Glycolysis(in cytoplasm) includes breakdown of glucose in to pyruvic acid.it occurs outside the mitochondria in the cytoplasm,and is always a constituent of the anaerobic respiration,where pyruvic acid is broken down to ethanol in plants and lactic acid in naimals. It is followed by the krebbs cycle which occurs in presence of Oxygen. Here Pyruvic acid breaks down in cyclic manner,step by step to produse ATP and CO2.The hydrogen ions eleased are removed through oxygen supply,forming h2o. Steps of krebbs cycle are same in plants and animals

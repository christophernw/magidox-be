Technically you don't.  You are moving at the same speed as the Earth.  However, when you jump in the air, you will be slowed down very slightly by the air (air resistance).  The difference is too small to be practical or really measureable, and it would only work if you jumped perfectly vertically.  However, law of physics do dictate that you would land slightly west from where you jumped.

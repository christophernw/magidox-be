The smelll of a fart is a pretty good indication of what condition your bowels are in. A particularly acrid fart could mean that you've eaten something bad, or even suggest an infection. Smelling our own farts could be a basic brain mechanism for checking on how our innards are doing.. . This is the second fart question I've answered seriously today...

It depends on the kind of depression. Do you have situational depression, such as your hubby left you, loss of a loved one or job, big change in income or job? You may be able to overcome that with behavior modification as simple as exercise, more sunlight, doing things for yourself or others. Clinical depression, the long lasting type is best helped by meds or therapy.

Hey! Dryers gotta eat too, ya know. Or maybe the pair got divorced. I've seen some tragic sock-fights in my day and they ain't pretty. Why do you think they get holes in em? They beat the crap out of each other. At least thats what my socks tell me. Oh, and the way they gossip! It's shameful! You know, the other socks may be jealous. If one of your missing socks was part of your favorite pair and the other socks know it.....need I say more? Tina

cats do sometimes get pustules ( pimples with puss) under their chin, this is straight from the vets office, get a jar of clearasil pore cleansing pads YES the same as kids use for acne,wipe affected area twice a day and they should dissapear in a week or so if not a trip to the vet isn't out of the question.

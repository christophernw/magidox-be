Well they would probably argue that the gold they posses is in religious paraphernalia and that it is sacred and it would be blasphemous to sell it. The real truth is that no one knows the wealth that the catholic church really possesses centuries of waging war in the name of god and religious persecution have probably filled the bank pretty well, but I don't think anyone will ever know just how much wealth they posses and has been the tradition all along they will keep it to themselves.

You have always cross the border illegally, the problem now is that it turned into an invasion of your citizens. The reason that big corporation hired you is because they could abuse you, exploited you, and pay you what ever they want. The big corporations need cheap labor because like that they make more money, low pay and no fringe benefits. When they need high skill workers they don't go to the illegal Mexicans, because you people are not educated. They need bilingual personnel in order to give you orders and keep you working. They don't consider you stronger or hard working people they consider you a mass of uneducated people that they could do what ever they want with you all. Another thing we the Americans don't blame the illegals but when they start demanding or disrespecting our citizens our flags, etc. then we have to attack, that's normal don't you think..That's all, Do you think that's honorable or shameful on your part and theirs. I think so..

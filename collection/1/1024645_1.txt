try to put something together that communicates your ideas and your capability to communicate (show that you know how to use various programs like autocad, photoshop, etc...). . keep it simple and clear. and remember that basically nobody hires a recent grad for their great ideas- they like to see that you are creative but what they really need is somebody who is capable of communicating THEIR ideas, following instructions, creating drawings and renderings. and somebody willing to work hard and long hours.. . your ideas come later. hope this helps.

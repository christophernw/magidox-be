go to an eveing GED classes and take a practice test, or go to the library pick up a form and fill it out and they will send you an date and time where the test is being taken in your area. takes about 2 months. or you can go to accredited business college, like i did and i obtained a ged, associate degree and bachelors degree in 4 years. good luck.

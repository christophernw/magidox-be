Incest.  There's always incest somewhere in V.C. Andrews.. . There also is a pattern to her series.  The second to last book usually is about the second generation, while the grand finale is a prequel which unveils all the secret stuff we didn't know about before (usually involves even more incest.). . I don't know about Rory Emerald, though.

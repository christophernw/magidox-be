Members of the Roman Catholic Church are Christians.  So are lots of others who believe that Jesus was the Messiah, the only begotten son of god, who was crucified and rose from the dead.. . After that, there's a lot of discrepancies.. . Many pentecostal sects deny that catholics are christians.  They think that we "worship" Mary, and find many things about the Catholic Chruch's teachings to be wrong or misguided.. . There are also sects of Christians who sincerely believe that all Catholics are going to hell because we have been brainwashed by the papcy in rome to believe that the "death cookies" we eat every Sunday at Mass are the tool of the Devil.  [really, I couldn't make this up... I found a phamphlet explaining this]. . Give it up ... just accept that no two sects of Christians are going to completely agree on religion this side of the grave.. . We'll all find out who was right after we die.

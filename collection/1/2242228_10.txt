Take him/her aside one day, and ask them about it.  You could start off......."I notice that sometimes you kinda smell........have you tried using a different deoderant"  Something like that.  Don't let the friend think that you don't like being around them, let them know that you like it, probably don't mind it much, but as it may bother others you can make suggestions.  Maybe he/she is allergic to certain deoderants, or maybe they have been using a particular brand for so long that their body has kinda gotten accustomed to it.  Maybe they should change it, and you could probably help them overcome something that either they were not aware of, or were too afraid to ask anyone about.

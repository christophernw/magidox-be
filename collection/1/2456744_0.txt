One word: freedom.  In a GTA game, you're pretty much free to do whatever you want.  You can take missions at you leisure, drive around the entire place as you desire (once their open), and can if you're so inclined kill a incredible number of people.  I personally don't go for the last part, cathartic as it may be, but it's just that there are so many things you can do in the game.  With a number of games being very linear, it's nice to be able to do what you want, when you want.  And when you add in all of the non-story things you can do (races, stunts, side quests, etc), it just makes the game that much better.. Yes, the gameplay hasn't changed much in the past five or so years, but when something is done right the first time, you do not need to make changes.  The game has made improvements, such as better storylines, better targeting, swimming, etc.  And while it may not be the best looking game on the consoles, take into account what it does.  With San Andreas, there were no essentially no boundaries and no loading screens going from city to city.  You were able to fly vehicles, go literally anywhere you wanted at will.  Most games with great graphics limit where you can go, so they can hike up the graphics.  So if I had to take a hit in graphical quality in order to have the freedom to do what I want and go where I want, it's worth it.  Personally, I like the look of the GTA games.  They may not be shiny, but their realistic.  Also, as of the last four (especially San Andreas), you can change how your character looks, something 90% of games will not let you do.  Being able to customize your character helps bring you into the story, even if just a little.. But that's just my opinion.  Hope it helps.

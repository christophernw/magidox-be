I would suggest soft hues of blue and grey, main colour being possibly a slate blue , and creating geometric design with curves with the contrasting soft grey colour.  Blues have a very calming effect and the curves will give a softer appearance as compared to sharp angles. As waits in a clinic tend to be long, these colours along with soft lighting effect should make the client feel comfortable during a long wait.

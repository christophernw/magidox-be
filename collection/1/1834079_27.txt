I'm 5'5, and 110ish pounds. I have curves, and I don't think I'm stick thin. However, I totally agree with you. It's so stupid. Every girl should just love their bodies for what they are and if they don't like that extra bit, then exercise more. Don't wanna exercise? Don't complain. I mean, it just makes for an awkward moment (in my opinion) when a friend says to her other friends, of all shapes and sizes, "Am I fat?" Ugh. It's annoying. Sorry this is so long. Anyway, I love the Dove commercials cause they show all kinds of women, and they're all really gorgeous to me. Well, there's my 2 cents. Have a good one.

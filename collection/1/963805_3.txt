It sounds like your battery is OK because you said it turns over. It is a little difficult to make a diagnosis based on based on imformation provided in you question. You or someone more experienced need to determine if you fuel and ignition systems are functioning properly. If your car is computerised, both of these systems rely heavily on output parameters supplied by the computer. These parameters vary depending imformation provided by various sensors. Regardless of vehicle age, you first need to determine which of these two systems is at fault. I sure hope this helps.

From my own personal experience, bankruptcy has taken away a lot of the stress that we had prior to filing. However; due to job loss we lost our house, our car. We didn't have credit cards just a lot of medical bills. We still owe back taxes, back child support and student loans. Now we can't get credit for anything. When we did apply for a car loan, they required a huge down payment. . . Dave Ramsey has an excellent book out about getting rid of debt. I don't remember the name but it just might help you out. Contact your mortgage company and all creditors to see if they will work with you. They really don't want their property back.. . Good Luck!!!

Not enough votes on the Supreme Court.  They appoint justices, but these justices end up "turning' on them.. . There was a plan - they couldn't implement it.. . Just as I'm sure many of Clinton's plans were thwarted by a Republican congress, rightly or wrongly.. . PS  If abortion goes back to the strates, NY, California, NJ and a couple of the other most populous states would immediately make it legal at the state level.  Overturning Roe v Wade would prevent relatively few abortions.  Pro-choice people, and especially pro-life people, don't seem to really appreciate this.  An overturning will be followed by a big let down for the anti-abortion choices.

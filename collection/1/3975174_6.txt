To get the rust out you can drop in a hand full of nots and bolts and turn the tank every which way, don't shake it or you will cause dents from the inside. You no doubt will have to do this repeatedly to get the rust scale loose, then flush it thoroughly.. DO NOT use the chemical called KREEM, it doesn't last, what does last is a product called REDKOTE. You didn't mention if this is a street bike or an older dirt bike, but if you need a good used tank there are plenty of good salvage sites on the net.

Inheritance is only one component. For Type I, it is suspected that there is also an auto-immune component, where the pancreas is affected by a virus that causes it to stop producing insulin. Obviously, this has nothing to do with lifestyle -- it just happens. With Type II, there may be some small genetic predisposition, but chiefly this type is caused by obesity, poor diet, and poor lifestyle choices.

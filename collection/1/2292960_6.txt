Look at the state of these other counties, I'm no Bush fan but I do love America. Look at Mexico, it's one of the biggest piece of shi* counties on the earth, pollution, crime, hopeless political infighting, greed just to get stated. If it's so damn great why is there such a mass influx of immigrants. Blame yourselves. Look at crime statistics in California alone, just look it up it's easy. See who is comiting crimes here. I don't want another Mexico in my back yard. Call me racist or whatever, I'm a realist, I love America for what it gives me, opportunity. Quit with your boring white man rhetoric, or simply leave to Mexico, I here there is tons of opportunity there.

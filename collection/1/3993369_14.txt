try mixing rice with her food. since your son left she probably really misses him. I would take her to the vet since she hasn't eaten in 4 days. Dogs get very attatched to one person and she will mourn him, but she should have started to eat again, so something else may be wrong. Dogs can get depressed just like people and the vet will be able to look at her and see if that's what is wrong.

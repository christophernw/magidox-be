You realize a lot of Confucian ideals were lost during the cultural revolution, industrial revolution, and especially in the younger generation?  But top 3 from my outsider's viewpoint:  (1) acceptance of one's lot in life, the idea that the set order should not be challenged or changed, (2) seeking balance and harmony physically, mentally, spritutally, and socially, (3) stratification of social relationships for instance younger lower than elder and women lower than men.  (Purely opinion!)

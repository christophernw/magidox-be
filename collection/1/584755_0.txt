Paul Revere was a lookout assigned to keep watch for British troops near Boston. On April 18, 1775, they spotted the British and rode through Massachussets warning the colonists to prepare for battle, giving them warning before the eventual battle of Lexington the next day. His ride is commemorated in a Longfellow poem.

Steam turbines are used to generate electricity which turns the prop shaft.. Using steam is a very effficient way to use fuel and electric motors can rotate at very high speeds so reducing the need for gearboxes as with some more convetional ships.. Some ships use nuclear plants to generate this steam rather like a nuclear power station.. As you proably are aware, steam was used originally to drive ships in times gone by.. Once the internal combustion engine was developed, ships used two stroke engines, and to reverse the ship they would stop the engine, alter the magneto or injection pump position and start the engine up in reverse.. Deisel for most medium sized ships is the preferred method for moving ships now and they have some very very big engines that are incredibly slow revving.. They generally have very long strokes and big bores providing maximum torque which can be turned into movement at the propellor.

It is impossible. I went to a very strict Christian school, and people still sold drugs. Occasionally people would get caught using drugs, but no one was ever caught selling drugs. The kids who sell drugs are very good at concealing their activities. They are very secretave, and no matter how much a school drug-tests, these people can not be stopped. At my college, there are very strict dormitory rules, and random drug tests. Still, drug trafficking occurs because sketchy people know how to get around the rules.

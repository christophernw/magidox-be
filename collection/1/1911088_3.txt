It means to divide a number by 4 as many times as possible and the remainder will be the number mod4.. For example 4 (mod 4) = 0 because 4/4 = 1 with no remainder.. 5 (mod 4) = 1 because 5/4 = 1 with  remainder 1. 6 (mod 4) = 2 because 6/4 = 1 with remainder 2. 7 (mod 4) =3 B=because 7/4 = 1 with remainder 3. 8 (mod 4) = 0 because 8/4 = 2 with remainder 0. 9 (mod 4 ) = 1 because 9/4 = 2 with remainder  1. So just divide the given number by 4 and thr remainder is the answer.

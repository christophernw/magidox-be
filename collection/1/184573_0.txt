alnjk: I agree that it is difficult to circumvente around the meaning of the word illegal, although some have tried to distort the meaning by referring to those having an illegal status by calling them "undocumented" instead. The terms "immigrant" and "ILLEGAL immigrant are NOT interchangable. For example if I tell you to screw in a light bulb you would put the light bulb in...If I asked you to UNscrew the light bulb, you would know that I ment to take it out. PREFIXES make a BIG difference in the meaning of a word.......yes the word 'prefix' is a transitive verb.

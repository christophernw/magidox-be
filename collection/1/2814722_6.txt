well, i guess it's not ban because they are bettering people around them's health.  They are trying to regulate that for the whole country, like no smoking in bars.  They found out that the second hand smoke can still give someone lung cancer so because everyone has the right to "life, liberty and purstuit of happiness", then figure they are protecting other people's unalienable rights by taking away other rights that are taken for granted.

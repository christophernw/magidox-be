I'm sorry but this is an impossible question. There are too many awesome games out there. I can give you a list though.. 1)FFVII, FF, FFII, FFIV. 2)LoZ: Ocarina of Time. 3)Super Smash Bros/Melee. 4)Pokemon Blue/Gold/Ruby. 5)LoZ: The Windwaker. 6)007 Goldeneye. That's just the tip of the iceburg but I will stop there. Oh and my favorite console ever is a toss up between the N64 and the Gamecube.

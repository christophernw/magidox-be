Politics........ . Simply put, we have elected two highly corrupt groups of politicians into office who constantly say they are better than the other corrupt group. In the end we get a group of people who do things we would never do, with our money with our countries assets and with our approval (unfortunately).. . We just sit around and say, well, I'm not voting for that jerk again.

a birds body is built to fly,,,anyway it wings have nothing to do with it,,,even if you are given a set of wings,,,you would not be able to fly still because your bones are heavy,,,so make them hollow,,,and still you cant fly again,,,one thing is that birds have very powerful chest muscles which helps themto flap all the way to the sky,,,

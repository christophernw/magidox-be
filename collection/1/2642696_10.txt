Bipolar is spelt with an 'i':) There is a 'normal' mood scale. Biopolar is up and down, suicidal and depressed, then high and so high they are sometimes delusional and have no fear. . . This is caused by a saratonin imbalance in the brain (a chemical.) It is like a chain, moods and thoughts go from link to link. With bipolar, it's like a link is skipped and confusion arises.. . Bioploar is diagnosed by symptoms. There is no physical scan or test to show the saratonine levels. Even if there were, the levels change back and forth, I believe.. . This is treated with anti-depressants which take up to 6 weeks to fully work. Also some luck with eptileptic meds! Ativan is a drug commonly used to calm a person down and if taken under the tongue with a dissovable pill (sublingual), it takes effect within 30 min.. . Biopolar people can be very fun when on a high. And loners when depressed. Then there is the middle ground. The mood where they are most stable.. . It can be triggered by a tramua, even puburty. Sometimes it is outgrown.. . Hope this helps.

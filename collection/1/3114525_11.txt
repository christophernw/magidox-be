The symbol is "O", which is the first letter for Oxygen.. . The word oxygen derives from two words in Greek, οξυς (oxys) (acid, sharp) and γεινομαι (geinomai) (engender). The name "oxygen" was chosen because, at the time it was discovered in the late 18th century, it was believed that all acids contained oxygen.

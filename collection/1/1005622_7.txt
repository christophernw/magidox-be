First, forget everything in the universe about television personality Cesar Milan.. . To be the leader, make sure that everything valuable in your dog's world comes from you.  There's a link below that goes into more detail.  This is a foundation that goes along with any other training you do.. . Dogs don't become automatically trained and well-behaved by being "submissive", which is the nonsense of dominance theory and Cesar Milan.  It's important to be a leader for your dog, but dogs also need you to show them what you expect.  Barking is normal dog behavior.  Chewing is normal dog behavior.  Keeping objects in their mouth is normal dog behavior, and in dog language, they are justified in biting you if you try to wrestle it away from them.  In human language, it would be inexcusable for your dog to bite you for such a thing.  Oops, we have a language barrier there, eh?. . Below is a link that explains how to teach your dog to give you the item in his mouth without wrestling it away from him (how undignified for both of you!).  You can find lots more like it by Googling "resource guarding".. . Also, it's always useful to find a nice basic obedience class -- you get to have instructors teach you by example how to work with your dog, and it's a great way to bond.

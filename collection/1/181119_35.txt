i totally think that the best job would totally have to be babysitting.... . i totally love little kids..and they look up to me..and as long as I'm nice they do anything i want them to do.... you get paid enough....at least i think.... . but then again it is only a summer job..so it doesn't need to last the whole year.SO yeah know...and with this job..most of the time you can totally charge any amount that you want...in reason of course.... . haha..so i hoped i helped

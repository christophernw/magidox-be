lol - yikes!  Greenblatt!  Not quite the standard history.  :). . No one knows.  His will is one of only a handful of documents we have about his life (and death).  The proximity of the writing of his will to his date of death and his 'exit' from the theatre with Prospero's farewell in "The Tempest" suggest that he was in the midst of either deteriorating health or unusual retirement in 1610, though he died in 1616.  This is somewhat a long active period for it to have been a virus or plague, so either 'natural causes', or, perhaps, a longer-term disease (such as heart trouble or asthma) would be most plausible.

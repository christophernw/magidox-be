Very Good question!Being an arts student, i faced the question myself.Newe, when a thing is of artistic significance and is artistically and aesthetically portrayed, thats art.pornography seeks to entice human beings by portraying $exuality in morbid details.Thats not the case with art.art has a higher purpose whereas porn is the depiction of the body for ONLY sexual gratification.. . People who talk of porn being art, have to consider this that Hard porn which portrays fetish and bondage actually kills people in the process, whereas, this is not the case with art.Hard porn differs from the portrayal of naked models.Its cruel and disasterous with consequences ranging from infertility to death.Also sometimes porn is made without permission as in voyeurism.This is no imagination or aesthetics involved but just the moolah.Art is softer, milder, for stimulating the mind and for a higher purpose.This asthetic kind of art can be painting, movies etc. which even though involve sexual depiction, yet, aim towards a higher purpose>>>>that being aesthetic, moral or spiritual.. . Eg. the painting of Aphrodite/Venus or David by Michelangelo is art but can u place porn in the same light and give it the same kind of respect and admiration?I dont think so.

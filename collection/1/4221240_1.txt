Digital is the breaking down of sound into binary information (0s and 1s). This is opposed to analog, which is a physical imprint of sound, like a record groove.. . Stereo is a type of sound-reproduction that produces two sound channels (usually left and right). Stereo is short for stereophonic. There is also monophonic, which is one sound channel, and quadrophonic, which is four sound channels.

I do agree that the Geneva Convention rules are ridiculous.  War is the failure of civility, whereas rules are the hallmark of civilization.  Attempting to civilize war is futile.. . Also, where war unrestrained by such rules and its barbarities allowed to manifest themselves fully, perhaps we would not so readily go to war.

actually the answer about the templars is right. some of the others were only added later to make smaller the devastation that the pope caused. at the time the templars were massively rich and powerful. they had a banking system that is used as it was used then even today! they had amassed many holy articles and relics, they had empires of churches and assemblies. at the time the roman catholic church itself was about to go bankrupt. so the pope thinking he was smart declared the templars satan worshippers so that all of their belongings would go to the main church in probate. the order went out in secret to be opened by all knights of the faith (still in the crusades and of course no templar knights were to recieve any of these missives(orders)) the object was to put a surprise on the templars so that they wouldnt have a chance to hide any of their amassed wealth. sadly because of the satan accusation they had to be put to death on sight. hundreds of knights died that night. friday october 13th 1307(thanks to a previous answer). . as an added bonus info, the 13th card in the deck of tarot is death.

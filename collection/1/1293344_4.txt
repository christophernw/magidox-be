We cannot separate hydrogen from water because water is made up of hydrogen n oxygen, if we separate hydrogen from oxygen, it won't be called water anymore, it'll remain oxygen only. we can separate them by an electrical device, i dunno what is it called...i think electrolysis. hydrogen can be separated from water only chemically, not physically

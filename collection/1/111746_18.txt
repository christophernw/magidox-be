most everyone up tell now r right. there r 2 types of goals long and short term goals.your 31 so really its not to late, its just more importent to find wut yer goals r now more then ever. I suggest if yer concerned about yer thoughts on what to do or not to do, try a cognative model class. they can help point out goals in a big way, and help you work on which problums in yer life u want to work on.the best thing is most are very cheap and worth the time it takes to get the degree at the end of the course.however if you want to try on yer own, think about the things u want out of life a family or a better job? to move out of mom and dads house? what do u like to do, how can u better achive these things? goals is takeing a step back and trying to discover a way to get want u want. its a step by step process and it takes time. always remeber that results take time to measure so, even when u do set yer goals stick to it. if something isent working step back and check again. its hard to get going over and over again but it will be well worth it in end! =)

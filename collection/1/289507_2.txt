If you mean by being caught, like being pulled over by the cops, well with just a permit you will most likely just get a warning or a ticket. I can only see a warning depending on what you did. But if a parent or no one who is at least 18 with a license isn't in the car with you then I just see a ticket and your permit being taken away. ALong with the possible not getting your real license till 18.

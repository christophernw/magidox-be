Much of the academic work of ancient times that forms the foundation for modern culture and science was written in Latin or Greek. As a result, people who wanted to study science would learn these languages to read the books. The power of Rome perpetuated the use of Latin until the Age of Enlightenment, when the printing press combined with popular interest broke the monopoly on thought that Latin had enjoyed. Still, a couple thousand years of habit is hard to break, and some scientists still learn Latin. And changing the old names is unthinkable. Tyrannosaurus Rex must not become, "chomp chomp".

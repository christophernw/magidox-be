I started smoking this past February in France...you don't have to be 18 to get them there and I thought it'd be fun to buy them. I usually only smoke when I'm drunk (that's a whole other problem) and sometimes when I'm with my friend we both will smoke together...there's just nothing to do when you're a teenager.

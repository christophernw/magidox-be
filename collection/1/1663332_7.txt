The Arabs are the descendants of Abraham through his wife's Egyptian slave Hagar. The story is in Genesis 16. Notice verse 12. If you know any Arabs they might tell you that they are still taught their lineage when they are young children. This makes them half-brother with the Jews. They have been jealous ever since because Israel got the birthright and God's promises. So 635 years after the death of Jesus Muhammad invented allah and the Koran was written giving the Arabs preference.

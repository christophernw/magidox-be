In addition to the math and science I would advise taking "Shop" classes as well. They will give you a hands on feel for end uses and results of the garbage we design.  It is not a mathematically perfect world and just because your calculations are correct does not mean it will work in the Field. Additionally, the best engineers I have ever had the pleasure of working with were Technicians first.

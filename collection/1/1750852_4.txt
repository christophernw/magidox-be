The Supreme Court does not have original jurisdiction in criminal cases (or in any case except under very specific circumstances outline by the Constitution).  A criminal Court convicts and them the case works it's way up the system until it reaches the Supreme Court.  If the SCT upholds the ruling, there is no recourse.

toxoplasmosis is the warning for pregnant women.I've never heard of litter being a cause of cancer... Just use a low dust litter, use a covered box, use a litter bag, and wear gloves when you have to do anything with the box itself.. . I have had cats for 30 years and I am 100% healthy, mentally and physically!. . By the way if you heeded the warnings for everything, you'd be a paranoid wreck!

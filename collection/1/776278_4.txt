Ha! The A-51 Mole dude must have been out of the game for a long time! Area 51 is no longer even a classified security installation for the U.S. Government, and has been shutdown for almost five years now! Part of the reason was that the place was simply getting too much publicity. It was formerly a test site for Top Secret military aircraft, but that's about it. The conspiracy wing nuts will tell you about aliens and all that, but it's a bunch of hogwash. (Besides, the Alien crash was Roswell, NM, and not Area 51 in the Nevada desert.).   By the way: the NEW Area 51-type top secret base is in central Colorado, just north of Colorado Springs.

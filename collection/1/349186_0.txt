A New York minute is a very short period of time, sometimes significantly shorter than sixty seconds, and sometimes a form of hyperbole for "perhaps faster than you would believe is possible". The term refers to the common perception that New York City is very busy, with much happening at all hours of the day, and people often in a hurry and likely to be impatient.

Yeah I don't get most of it eather, I don't think he is as great as I used to think he was.  He has made mistakes, however the war on terror wasn't one of them.  Mabey certain things in the war he could have handled differently.  I think people think he is stupid because he often says things without thinking or phrases things badly.  Others will say he lied about there being weopons of mass destruction.  First of all there is a difference between lying and being mistacken secondly the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence meaning that just because we never found them doesn't mean they never existed.   There is also no politician who is 100% honest, they all lie about something. That's all I can think of right now.

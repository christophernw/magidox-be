Cowboys used to place a coil of rough rope around them when they had to sleep out in the desert. The theory being that thin hard twine would poke between the plates on their stomaches and discomfort them enough to turn back. Does this actually work? I don't know, it's an idea though, of course if your snakes aren't poisonous (and the percentage of venomous snakes is quite small) I'd let'em stay, after all they're natural pest control. I'd prefer the company of a snake to that of a rat any day of the week.

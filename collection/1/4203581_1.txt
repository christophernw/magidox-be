Although specific requirements for acceptance into a masters degree program will vary from school to school, the short answer is yes. Most of the time only a bachelor of science (regardless of the field) is required. However, you may (almost definitely) be required to make up any undergraduate course work you are deficient in. What usually happens is that you will be conditionally admitted into the program with the stipulation that you complete the make up classes in a certain time frame. These courses won't count toward your masters degree. With a switch from Aero. Engr. to Astro. Physics I would expect you'll be required to make up 1-2 astronomy classes and a several physics classes too (i.e. a physical mechanics class, electromagnetism, maybe introductory quantum mechanics, etc.)

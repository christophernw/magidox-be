Alberto Fernanco Riccardo Semprini (born 1908, died January 19, 1990) was a British pianist, famous for appearances on the BBC. His initial fame came from headlining a light music programme, Semprini Serenade, that first aired on BBC Radio in 1957 and continued for around 25 years. His surname was later immortalised as a fictional profanity in an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus.

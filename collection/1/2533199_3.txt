liquid ivory soap or ivory bar soap. Not the detergent kind.Use it like a flea shampooo and let it sit a few minutes.This is also safe for puppies.. Frontline if you think about it is only like 20 dollars a month and it is well worth it!YOu can also put a couple drops near a major traffic area in your house and it will disperse thru your house and kill any in your carpet

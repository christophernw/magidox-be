Every year I go with my sisters and their kids for Chinese food on Christmas Eve. We have an inflatable tree. Come Christmas everyone opens presents and then assembles at my house where they get more presents. We watch Jackie Chan action movies (preferably the older and badly dubbed ones) after we open presents. And then, since we live in LA and the kiddies don't get snow, I take them to the beach to build sand-castles instead of snowmen. Then we come back and eat the dinner my sisters and their husbands have mad.

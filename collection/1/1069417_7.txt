To my knowledge Vibhishan has not cheated Ravan.He was always on the side of DHARMA. He requested Ravan also to follow the rules of Dharma in case of Sita. But Ravan was blind enough to put an ear to sayings of Vibhishan,because he was always thinking about Sita. In those days women are the persons who used to receive utmost respect. Even in case of Ravan he never insisted Sita to marry him, he used to ask the lady guards to change her mind to marry him.This shows the respect that women in those days used to receive. At the end Vibhishan has no choice to go to the opposition and help Rama. Rama was always on the side of SATYA,DHARMA,and NYAYA.Vibhishan has the right option and helped Rama to gain his strength over DHARMA.

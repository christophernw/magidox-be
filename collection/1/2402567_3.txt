I should write a book about this subject because I have been through it time and time again with my father. Currently he is going through it yet again ...paying for EVERYTHING and pulling the shift his lady friend misses. I tried evrything over the years to make him understand that he was being taken advantage of but he was lonely and ignored all pleas to leave them. But like past experiences he eventually grew tired and restless of the abuse and left. He is now growing tired of his current situation and your mom will to. It's very frustrating watching the ones you love get taken advantage of but believe me noone is that blind to these type situations. Voice your concerns!

Alcohol is not an sickness.Alcoholism is though,In restaurants it is cause you are eating as well and if you eat bread it absorbs some alcohol.Drank in moderation it is to relax or unwind from the day.It is the people's responses to being drunk that indangers people and the lack of guts from friends or family to take the drunk person's keys away and make them sleep it off,give them popcorn(butterless) and coffe.

you don't need to join a church so you can repent your sins. you talk to God directly between you and him. . . you don't need to confess your sins to a priest. a priest is a human being just like me and you who can do mistakes and sins. he is no holy man. . . in Islam we seek forgiviness directly to God. but it's recommended that your cloth/body should be clean, and in a place that is clean.

Unfortunately, all of our lives are filled with consequences. I don't want to sound harsh because that is not my intention.. It is a horrible thing that happened to you friend. I could not have wished that on anyone.. I don't know that God is teaching others a lesson by taking her life. God does allow these things to happen, though. It doesn't seem fair sometimes. This world is full of hate and despair and so many of us fall victim to it's deceitfulness everyday.. There is no good answer as to why it had to be your friend. None of us are immune from the choices we make. We take a risk just by walking down the street. . . I am so sorry to hear that you lost your best friend. A loss like this is never an easy one. I hope that one day you can be at peace with God. It is easy to be mad at Him during times like this.. . If you need someone to talk to, please feel free to contact me.

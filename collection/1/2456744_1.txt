GTA is popular for a couple of reasons - it is very appealing for people to play a videogame and be able to do things they would never do in real life, carjack people, run people over or shoot people, people see them themselves through the character they are playing as, and mostly people see what they are doing in the game as fun without suffering any real life consequences such as really dying or really going to jail.

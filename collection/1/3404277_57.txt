Some religions forbid eating pork because of certain dangers inherent in undercooking or other preparations limitations.  Others forbid eating pork because the animal is considered "unclean"; though this is not really a physical assessment.  When an animal is considered unclean, it can be for many reasons, such as considering any animal with cloven hooves to be unsuitable for consumption.  Perhaps it is considered unclean because of its dietary characteristics.  Usually religions consider certain foods out-of-bounds simply because they are forbidden in an inspired law given by their God or because the animal is representative of other religions.  Pigs were once worshipped in certain areas around the Sea of Galilee, by the pagan peoples who lived there.  This may have been one reason that pork is not a kosher food.

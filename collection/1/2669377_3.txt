Not all vegans sneak. The ones who do however are part of a world wide pandemic of hypocracy where the mantra is; do as I say and not as I do. These insecure people want to project a certain image that they feel is better or more superior to others. What they really need is counseling to boost their self esteem, hope this helps.

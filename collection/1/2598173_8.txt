I believe it would be. Imigrants are coming into the United States where our learning and speaking habits were and are based on the English language which I agree should become our National language by law. Try going into a country outside of the USA and demand the people in that country to speak English and see what happens. So what is so different then us wanting to do the same thing. If you want to live in another country and survive you had better learn their language. I respect their choice so why shouldn't they respect mine? In the old village within a city they spoke their previous country langauge within that village but taught the English language to their children as well as spoke it themselves. I think it's high time that the USA press the point and make the English language mandatory for all incoming immigrants to make a harmony among all peoples in how we speak. There are no more villages within a city any more.

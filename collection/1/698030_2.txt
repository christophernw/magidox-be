Do you actually need it?  I know some people do.  My mom did until recently.  But if you actually do need it, go to your state's government page and search for social services.. . Oh, and if you're being for real... ignore the hateful people here.  There are people who abuse the system but there are *at least* as many who really do need it.  It doesn't make much sense to work 40+ hours/week, be away from your kids all day/night, and still make less money than you would've if you'd just stayed home.  But people are faced with that decision all the time.  My mom was.

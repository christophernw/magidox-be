When you jump you are theoretically in orbit around the earths center of mass (CM) for the short time you are off the ground. But the orbital speed needed to maintain a stable orbit at your altitude is much higher than the earths inherent rotation. So you are not in a stable orbit, since you are rotating around the earth's CM too slowly. Result is that you accelerate toward earth's CM. Your trajectory is more closely parabolic, and the parabolic displacement over your entire flight is slightly to west as previously mentioned. This displacement is actually lessened by the fact that the earth's atmosphere is also spinning around at the same rotation rate as the earth itself (excluding windage).. . The bottom line is that all effects are completely swamped out by windage and inability to measure minute distances associated with the orbital dynamics.. . The effect can be seen more easily if you shoot a bullet from a gun straight up. For a vertical launch on a windless day, the bullet will come down a couple of hundred yards to the west with a speed of around 100-200 mph with the actual displacement/velocity depending on the mass of the bullet, muzzle velocity, air density. . . I donâ€™t recommend anyone to try this as someone could get hurt on the return path. Adding windage back into the equation, the shooter could get hit for example.. . Also the effect is more pronounced at the equator, and is zero at the poles.

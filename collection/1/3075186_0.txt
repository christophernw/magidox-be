lol good question i have thought bout this how do we know waht's good and whats evil ... we all have dif views so good and evil could never be 100% just. What i think is good you might think it is evil, what you think is good i might think it is actually evil.  But we do agree on alot of things as humans there is plenty of comon ground so to speak that is how we consider good from evil.

Absolutely, athletes foot is a fungus that grows because your skin on your foot is not dry. So if you get out fo the shower and do not dry all of your foot properly (also in between your toes) and then put your socks on you are creating the ideal breeding ground for the fungus to grow. . You can also get it if you put on wet or damp socks or shoes, or if you have shared socks, shoes, shower area or a towel with someone who has athletes foot as it is pretty contagious.

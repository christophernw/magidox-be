injected? or carby? i'd be guessin carby....righto...electronic ignition or not? if it doesnt have electronic ignition ur safe as houses...pull the carby off...go and buy urself a carby spacer...slip that on between the carby and intake manifold. PS: try reconditioning ur engine...V8's specially big blocks are ment to do at least 6 grand if not 7 grand outta the box....

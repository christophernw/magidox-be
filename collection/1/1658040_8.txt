I got rid of my roommate's cat.  I'm allergic to it, and I gave it about 6 months before I'd had enough.  I just plain out told her that it was my house too.  I was paying half the rent, and here was the deal.  I was going to lock the cat in her room everytime I came home and let the cat destroy just her stuff, or I was going to find a home for it.  She said "fine, leave her in my room" so I did.  After about a week of that she said "we gotta get rid of this cat, she's TEARING my room apart!"  HEHE.

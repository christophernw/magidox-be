It is a nursing issue. So is purring. The purring is the throat vibrating mother's milk down the esophagus. The drooling is... well you know about Pavlov's dog studies? The cat is feeling very mothered and hunger issues show their charcteristics. I do not want to talk about Pavlov, because the experiments were actually very mean if you care to study how he actually did that.. The â€œkneading" that your cat may do is a kitten behavior to massage mother's milk from the mother's mammilary glands.. So, the drooling, the purring and the kneading are all feeding behaviors. Does your cat purr when you put down its dish and it chews food? Even lions purr as they rip humans apart. However I still believe in love and I know that is all tied in there somewhere. I love cats.. Even polar bears. I even love polar bears now, even though they eat each other if given half a chance.

How are you supposed to notice any other immigrants? I am sick of hearing that crap anyway. Italians, Irish, etc.... did NOT come here and try to take over. They respected our laws, people and at the very least OUR FLAG. Oh and they learned ENGLISH. I keep hearing that this was Mexican land FIRST, No it wasn't. This was INDIAN COUNTRY.(NATIVE AMERICAN)

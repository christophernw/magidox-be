these days you get a fabric glue with which to paste the sequins onto the fabric. The glue is quite good and the sequins don't come off even after washing. It is available with hobby shops where you buy the sequins.. . If you still want to hand-sew, it'll take a lot of time, you need to put the sequin on the fabric, bring the needle from the edge on the sequin through the fabric, and then again through the center to the other edge.

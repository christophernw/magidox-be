There are no "human rights".  That's a collectivist term for "privileges we infallible tsars permit our slaves".. Human rights refer to the rights of each human as a free man.  . The part of such rights in government is two things.. . One is: Rights allow you to decide whether you're going to be able live or die by your own control of your capitalism, your creative efforts at work done on real space-time. This is helped along by the government's personnel NOT allowing anyone to interfere in what you're up to, so long as you commit no crime against others, including its own bureaucrats.. . Two is: Rights require the scientific defining of category-level 'regulations"--step-by-step instructions as to "how you claim your liberty" by first watching out for others, in a non-negligent way, and then you are told how much you can claim by performing some category or type of a value creation.. . So: human rights, the rights of the individual adults participating in a marketplace of lives--the rights to be defining basic ideas, the rights of exchanging goods and services, the rights of getting hired and then competing to attain leadership positions and the right to compete to earn appointed and elective governmental protective offices, all these are based on the self-responsible individualism of free citizens.  . . Not on the benevolent tyranny of a government's tsars committing crimes against its citizens supposedly for their own good by taking those rights away. But on selfish rights enjoyed in liberty, rights to pursue one's own prioritized idea of happiness, not the government's latest four-year plan.. . It's as simple as that. Humans need rights to be human.. Citizens of countries need rights to be better off being in a societal association with others than they would be out in the wilderness without government.

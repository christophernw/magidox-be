The same reason why people were pro slavery. A fetus isn't a person just like a "n*gger" wasn't a person. It really disgusts me when people use abortion as a form of birth control. A baby dies simply because a couple of people wouldn't wait until they were married to have sex, you know, the kind of people who call promiscuity "sexual freedom". Sure there's situations of rape, but how often is that the case? I know I may sound like a judgemental b*tch, but it's the cold hard truth and it's time that people stop deluding themselves and wake up.

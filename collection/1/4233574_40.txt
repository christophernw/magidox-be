One, the Bible states God created the Earth with Adam & Eve on it, no evolution and stuff like others believe in.. Two, no, I've forgotten what the second one was.. Differant people believe differant things, I don't believe the writers who contributed to the Bible believed in dinosaures, or even had the scientific know how to discover them.

Very simple--you will make more money than those who don't.  It is hard to get through college and earn your bachelor's degree but the money is better.  Personally, when I earned my Master's Degree I jumped in my yearly salary about $18,000 in ONE year.  When I earned another 30 semester units above my Master's Degree I jumped another $8,000.  So for simply getting more education I enjoyed a $26,000 a year RAISE--not salary but a raise of that much.  It is nice to  be paid more simply for going to school more than others.

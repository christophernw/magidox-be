C'mon, women do rule the country.  They just do it from the shadows and let the men take all the blame.. . If a woman made it to the point of being nominated for President I would definitely vote for her.  We need a big change and that might just be it.  As far as peace?  That would be great, but if you watch any two groups of people anywhere you'll see conflict.  But, just like in any fight, no matter how big or small, there is always a diplomatic solution, a way out without violence, if both sides are willing to use their brains.  Women tend to be less violent depending on their upbringing and life experiences and could probably find other solutions by nature better than men.  We have fought war after war after war in this world without a single one of them being unavoidable if the right people were doing the thinking.

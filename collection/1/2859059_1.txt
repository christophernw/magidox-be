Bees are actually most often attracted by the pattern that is created in the coloring of the flower.  The stronger the contrast between the center of the flower, and the outside of the flower, the easier it is for them to see that they should pay a visit.  You might notice, for example, that bees would be attracted to pansies that have white leaves, but have a purple center.. Also, bees are attracted to sweet smelling flowers.  One of the most common white flowers, daisies, are foul smelling, and use flies to pollenate, as opposed to bees.

They do need a properly maintained saltwater aquarium. If you have one of those, you need to check your nitrate level. Those crustaceans need a particular amount of nitrates in the water. If you have that , take a sample to your pet stroe and they should be able to check it for that for you. You might need a product called nitrex. Starfish are not the most hardiest of species. You might want to consider the chocolate chip star  and a horseshoe crab for starters. Also try peppermint banded shrimp--All saltwater of course-hope this helps and good luck

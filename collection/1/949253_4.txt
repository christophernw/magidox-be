Cranberry juice is helpful for urinary tract infections, good for people with kidney stones, fevers, and asthma... the only drawback is that most cranberry juice contains a large amount of sugar.  If you are drinking it for a urinary tract infection, the sugar will only feed the bacteria.  Look for all juice blends, and read the ingredient list to be sure.

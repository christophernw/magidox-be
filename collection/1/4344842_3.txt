Political correctness. period. prople would have you believe all lung cancer is caused by cigarette smoke, even though the U.S. government states the second largest cause of lung cancer is, in fact, radon gas.  nonetheless, anti-smokers will lump all lung cancer deaths as caused by cigarettes.. . and that's ignoring the fact that according to the U.S. government and innumerable consumer groups, we breath in hundreds of chemical pollutants every day.  but i suppose, to the anti-smokers, that's not relevant....it doesn't support their smug, self-righteous position.

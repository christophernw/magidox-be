If you have a failure to appear in traffic court and have missed a rescheduled court date there will be a bench warrant out for your arrest.  If you allow this to continue for too long with outstanding fine some states suspend your license.  All you have to do is contact the traffic court or clerks office of the courthouse you were to appear at and find out what to do.

We all go through this, so do not be discouraged.  In praying, take one person or one subject at a time.  Don't try to pray for the whole world at one.  Keep your prayer simple and brief---God hears you the first time, he is not deaf and he is not stupid.  Some people---particularly pastors---feel that they have to make long and drawn out dissertation to God that are more complicated than a doctoral thesis on nuclear physics and that they have to scream at the top of their voice..  Simplicity is always the best approach.  Before going into a prayer session have an idea about what you want to pray about.  If you are at a loss for some one or something specific to pray for or about, then pick up your Bible and begin to read from the Book of Psalms.  The psalms are poetry, songs and prayers.   I pray that this helps you.  Jesus loves you and he loves to fellowship with you in prayer.  Prayer to God is a form of ministering to God.  We are to minister to him if we expect him to minister to us.  God bless you for your question.

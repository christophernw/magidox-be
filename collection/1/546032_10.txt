Leaving it alone is the best remedy, but if that doesn't suit you.... . try putting Zinc on it to speed healing time, use abreva to protect your healthy skin around it from getting cold sores too, and replace your toothbrush so you don't get anymore.. . and for the love of Christ... stop picking it... EWW!!!. . LOL

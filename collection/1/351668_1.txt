In the U.S., I think the Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod is still doing pretty well numerically. . . But for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ECLA), I agree with the other answers, that it has drifted too far to the left, and is now suffering the same decline in membership that most other mainline churches are going through.

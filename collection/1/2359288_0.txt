well first as soon as you see her going potty in the house even if you make a mess lift her up and trow her outside, point with your finger and maker see the grass and since she's still be doing whatever she's was doing make sure you pet her when she's done outside, I had the same problem with my dog and I bought every single thing out there to help me but nothing work until I decided to go getto and got some news paper went outside and rub the paper on the thing and brought it inside the house, she'll smell her own smell and at least she won't be going anywhere else but the paper, after a while don't leave paper any more and she won't be able to go because her smell won't be inside the house any more and she'll wait. make sure you clean your carpet, floors etc before...and if it doesn't work you should consider moving into a house witha backyard where you can just leave her out there until she goes...dogs are like little kids and you should not just think of getting rid of her just because she won't pee outside...think about it...she also has feellings...be nice!!!!

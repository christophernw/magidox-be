If you are referring to type II, then watch your weight. You do not want to be overweight. Actually, underweight is better. Avoid suger, not altogether, but as much as possible. The less the better. Avoid too much carbohydrates, another form of sugar. You need carbs, but not too many. Lots of vegatibles. . . And finally, exercise. At least 1/2 hour 4 times a day. That is the bare minimum. . . If we are talking type I, there is not much you can do. It just hits some people.

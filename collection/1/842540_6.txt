HELLO LEMON. ##################################################################################################################. This should help you LEMON DROP. Sweaty Palms . (Palmar Hyperhidrosis): (+) Bookmark Page   . Sweaty Palms, known medically as Palmer Hyperhidrosis, or excessive hand sweating, is the most common presentation of hyperhidrosis. The term "hypersympathetic activity" is more accurate terminology because excessive sweating is caused by heightened activity in the sympathetic chain. The sympathetic chain, part of the Autonomic Nervous System, is located within the chest cavity and has nothing to do with motoric or sensory functions. . Excessive hand sweating can be quite severe by affecting a patient's everyday life both functionally and socially. In about 40% of the patients the problem is genetic. Sweaty palms usually begins early in childhood and can get more severe towards the late teenage years and into early adulthood. . . The International Hyperhidrosis Society divides the severity of Palmar Hyperhidrosis or Excessive Hand Sweating into four subgroups. Group one consists of patients that have mild hand sweating that does not cause any functional or social problems. On the other end of the spectrum are patients with excessive hand sweating at a level of wetness described as dripping affecting them on a daily basis. Patients from the last group rarely have benefit from conservative measures such as Drysol, Drionic, Maxim, Oral Medications, or Botox. . . Cure for Sweaty Palms:. The operation known as Thoracic Sympathectomy has developed over the last 50 to 60 years to what it is today. In the past, the operation was done either through the lower neck, back, or chest cavity. These approaches involved major surgical intervention that necessitated long hospital stays in addition to causing pain and excessive scarring. These are reasons why the operation was not commonly chosen. Over the last 20 years, advancements were made and many operations were performed with the help of miniature cameras (Endoscopic Surgery). In these surgeries, entrance into the body cavities, such as the abdomen or chest, is done through miniature incisions that result in minimal surgical damage and speedy recovery. Operations today are done on an outpatient basis (the patient returns home the same day) achieving the same results as the open operation in the past but without the long hospital stays, severe pain, and excessive scarring. . . .

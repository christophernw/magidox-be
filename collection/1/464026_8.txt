If by "differences" you mean conflict, I'd say the best way to help the genders communicate is to realize that our gender roles are social constructs and have not always been set in stone, nor do they have to be in the future. Gender is a continuum that is not absolute, so assigning qualities to people of different sexes (e.g. all men are tough, all women are emotional) is pointless and merely illusory.

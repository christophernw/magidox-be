allergies or an infection.... . has he had any fights? once my uncle's cat's kitten fought with another kitten and it was very serious...turns out that the other kitten used it claws to scratch the other's eyes and that is why the other had one eye blind...looks horrible. . sometimes your cat can fight with another cat if it is not agreeing with it so thatz why don't get two adult cats because they will sometimes not agree with each other and fight. if your cats eyes are still watery and drip clear fluid you will need to consult a vet because this sounds serious. probraly a vet can prescribe medicine for the eye or treat it professionally because if you handle this yourself and try to fix it you may make it even worse or possibly make your cat blind like my uncle's kitten. meanwhile clean the area around it and try not to touch it too much.

if her box is clean and the litter is the same, she might be sick and you need to take her to the vet. when my cat had a urinary tract infection, he did the same thing-. the itching might be allergies- from the carpet or a reaction to her food- which could contribute to her not using her box- taking her to the vet or at least calling one is probably a good idea.

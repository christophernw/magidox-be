well if you remove 3 lbs of intestine you reduce the weight be 3 lbs.... however in the long run by removing intestine the body can no longer absorb everything from the food you eat, this could cause a loss of weight however this is not a normal procedure. a gastric bypass seems to be more main streem, it cuts the size of the stomach and in turn decreases the amount you can eat. your intestine will still be there to absorb the nutrients it needs.

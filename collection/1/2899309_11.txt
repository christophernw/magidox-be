This is a sad situation-- he is what is called a "binge drinker" if he gets drunk periodically instead of daily or almost daily. . I hope you get in touch with AlAnon-- the group for family  and friends of alcoholics.. There isn't anything a person can do or say to make another person quit drinking.  The drunk always finds out the hard way-- that's the nature of the disease.. Alcoholism affects all the people in a drunk's life, and your friend may have a parent or grandparent who is/was also a drunk.. The progression of alcoholism isn't pretty, and drunks aren't easy to deal with.  . There is more information and literature about this subject than I can possibly tell you here, so please educate yourself by going online to AlAnon.. Your friend will need all the friends he can get.  And all the help you can give.  Much luck, God bless.

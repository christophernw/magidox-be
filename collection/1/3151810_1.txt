veggie oil is actually pretty expensive. i believe in terms of physics the process of making vegetable oil uses more energy than you get out of burning it (harvest, production etc), so it's not a very smart way to power things for the general pop. you could recycle used stuff but it's gross and has food stuff that would muck up your engine.

Inaccessibility.. Anywhere on a cat that gets excessively matted means that the cat can't groom itself properly in that area.. I'm assuming you have a medium to long haired cat. CShort hairs don't usually have this problem.. You might have to get yourself a pet brush and brush your kitty regularly. Maybe some hairball treatment food as well. If they can't cough up the hairballs faster than they develope, then the cat can't grooom himself properly.

I loved it there. My boyfriend and I stayed at the "TROPICANA". It is NOT in the Tourist area, but that is what we loved about it. If you decide to stay there look for a little shop that sells Frozen Chocolate cover Bananas and Strawberries with coconut. DELICIOUS!!!! It's Near "TROPICANA" right on a corner. Very nice place to vacation.

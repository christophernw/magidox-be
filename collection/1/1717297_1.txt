MRSA can "morph", if you will, and make itself resistant to the antibiotic you are currently on.  This is a horrible infection, and it's extremely contagious.  Check out  your environment.  You may be reinfecting yourself just from touching areas that are contaminated or being exposed to someone who may not know they have MRSA.  You can wipe down your immediate area with common alcohol; it will kill 99% of all bacteria on the surface where you are resting.  Wash your linen in bleach.  Were you in the hospital before getting this? Do you work in healthcare? The hospitals are great breeding grounds for MRSA as are nursing homes.  If you were in either before being infected, please make the institution that you believe you may have picked it up aware of this.  The nodules under your skin are just another aspect of the infection and should clear up when the MRSA is under control Please ask your doctor to help you deal with this; maybe have bloodwork done to see if there is another medication that would be more effective.  Keep up your nutrition and fluid intake; please wash your hands so you dont get any secondary infections or give this to someone else. Please be careful not to expose elderly to this as it can be fatal. You may want to get another opinion.  The doctor might want to check for Shingles on your ear; characterized by little blisters on the skin and pain along the nerve that it has infected.  Praying for your recovery.  God Bless.

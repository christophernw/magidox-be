Why do we put up with the heresies of christianity? Just because you believe in something doesn't mean I, or anyone else has to. And what is the difference between a "true" christian and an untrue christian. i don't think jesus christ would have made a distinction. For a religion that is supposedly based on the teachings of christ himself, you guys sure miss a lot of his main points. . . But i've been distracted from my main point:. Would you like to give up medicine? or your technology, like your computer or cell phone? If you don't want to give these things up, then you can't really want to "fight science".  Frankly, Science would probably kick your ass. . . When you have a closed mind you miss out on a lot.

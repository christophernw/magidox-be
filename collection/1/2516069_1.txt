there are plenty of books on keeping individual breeds. German shephered are tough, I know cos I work with them and own one. You have to be a very in charge person to keep a shepherd. They must know who's boss, but never hit or scold a shepherd as they will learn to bite. You need to be firm but kind as they are very sensitive, they need at least two 1 hour walks a day off lead, they must have their brains occupied, they are a working breed so must have something to do. Up to 1 you could do obedience, but after 1 they can do agility, working trails, all sorts. My best wishes as shepherds are an extremely rewarding dog to own if trained properly.

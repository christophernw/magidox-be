I usually try to size up the person.  If it is for a youth group, I usually give them money.  When it is for a church group I tend to be more picky.  If it is for disaster relief or a police organization, I give what I can. In my church I give a set amount every time. People begging on the street for money saying they are hungry do not usually get my money, but I tend to go to the nearest fast food place and get them something to eat and drink and bring it back to them.  They are always grateful and say thank you!

yeah, organic chem is so expansive because of the versatility of the carbon atom as a molecular "backbone."  Other atoms tend to only find their place in much smaller molecules or attached to a carbon-based molecule or macromolecule of some sort.  Carbon's versatility comes from having 4 valence electrons with a low atomic number, which in short means it can form bonds in up to 4 directions, and they're strong bonds because it's such a small atom (not a lot of electrons floating between the valence shell and the nucleus.  just to add to the last post.  :). . And while the term "organic" originally meant "created by life," it has come to mean the chemistry of carbon-based (organic) compounds, and it is used in this sense by universally, so it is far from meaningless as one person put it.

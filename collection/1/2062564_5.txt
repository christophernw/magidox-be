You tell her she needs to stop smoking and get help. Smoking is a horrible, nasty, disgusting habit and she really needs to stop. Tell her parents that she smokes and let them deal with her. She needs to stop and have some consequences for her actions.....It's her own dumb falt that she started, she NEEDS to quit for the better of herself........Smoking gives you bad breath, yellow teeth, can cause laringitus (srry if i spelled that wrong), and can cause lung cancer....SHE NEEDS TO STOP!! You can even get lung cancer from being around her from second hand smoke...SHE NEEDS TO QUIT!!

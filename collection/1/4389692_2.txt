Let me tell you why I, personally, fake it:. (Occasionally, of course. I AM capable of the real thing.). 1. After a while, we just get tired/bored/sore and want it to be over with.. 2. It's difficult to come without direct clitoral stimulation. Sometimes the guy want a position that doesn't provide this, and we must either fake it or take matters into our own hands. . 3. If the guy thinks we didn't come, he gets all insecure and then we have to hear "Isn't it big enough? What, don't I satisfy you? Are you sleeping with someone else?" Blah blah and all the other whiny crap. There's nothing we dread more than having to soothe a bruised male ego. It's easier just to fake it.. I will add, however, that an "experienced" guy can certainly tell the real thing from faking. The vaginal muscles contract very strongly and rapidly during orgasm and this is near impossible to fake.

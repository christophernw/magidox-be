Mexicans are more arrogant than any other people coming over and they expect everything for free.  You ask why they are the only ones being noticed. Because they get all of these handouts and demand things they have no right to and then expect us to welcome them with open arms while insulting us.  That is why people hate Mexicans and that is why they are the ones who get noticed mostly.  You tell people to get a book, gain some knowledge.  Take your own advice.  You are in dire need of a history lesson.  That is another thing that offends Americans.  Stupid criminals saying that they were here first, that is the most ridiculous thing ever said.  You seem to think just because you say something, that makes it true.  You can't change history.  You are an invader.  You were not here first.  Native Americans were here first, not you.

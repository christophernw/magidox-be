We are trying to save them.  We, as Christians, believe the only way to heaven is through Jesus Christ.  If you were about to walk through a door with someone waiting behind it to kill you, wouldn't you want me to stop you.  Unfortunately, some Christians go about this the wrong way.  . God does love everyone, but He HATES sin.  Jesus was sent to earth to wash away our sin so that we could be close to God.  . I do not think any Christian hates another religion.  We do disagree with their beliefs and some Christians will fight so hard to save them that it looks like hate.  When, in actuality, it is out of love.. . I hope this has answer your question.. . Prayers to you and yours.  <><

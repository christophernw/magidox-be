It is mostly known as "caloian". Scaloian is a rain ritual in Romania which is celebrated during severe draught season or when rain pours in ambundance. In a way, it is similar in some conducts with a ritual called "parapuda" and this is common in Wallachia (southern part of Romania) and among the Aromanians of Greece. In this ritual, young girls with merely protruding tits make several dolls, most important being either "father of sun"(for draught) or "mother of rain"(for excessive rain) to be buried with the traditional burial.

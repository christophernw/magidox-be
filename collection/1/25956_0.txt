Sodium fluoride is an ionic compound, so you can't really say that you have one "molecule" of sodium fluoride. Instead, what you have is an alternating arrangement of sodium and fluoride ions in a 6-coordinate ocathedral pattern in a crystal lattice. A nice picture of this is at the website listed below.

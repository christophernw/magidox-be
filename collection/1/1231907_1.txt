because that the US is starting to put God out of the equation.   The US government is starting to become very complacent with homosexuality and starting to give in to their needs and their wants, because they don't want to "offend" anyone. which  by the way they are carrying on, not only are they offending the ones who don't believe in homosexuality, they are denying the reason this country exist.  Godly morals. This country was founded on the gospel of Jesus Christ.  On the capitol building, the Lincoln memorial, every step,wall  of the WhiteHouse some form of Scripture, Title, Chapter, Verse is enscribed, which the founded fathers of this Country had placed their.  Thats why they are regressing in morals then progressing. which turns into not making homosexuality a punishable crime.

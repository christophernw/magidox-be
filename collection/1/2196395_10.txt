Insist on playing with toys, not your hand.. . If he bites then stop playing, and say something angry.. WAIT until he stops playing- pinch him on the scruff of the neck if you have to, and scold him- get him stopped so he can think about why he had to stop playing.. . Then get the toy out again and play with that guarding between your hand and his teeth. Lots of praise when he plays with the toy. Scold and stop playing if he gets your hand.

When putting insulin in the needles make sure you tap the needle and get the extra air out of the needle out before you inject the insulin into the area desired.You can give the shots in the arms, thighs, or stomach areas. Always give in the fatty areas. Always throw away the needles after each use. "You can practice on fruit such as a orange at first if needed.".  You may mix your Insulin's but never mix the Insulin call Lantus with any other Insulin that has to be administered by it self.

Well it doesn't help for made up words. I am tired, so i made up a word in my last answer. I said I would start answering questions "mono sylabblically" but should I have said "mono sylabbically"? Its hard to say, really. I think that I will start to make up words on a regular basis. How does that sound to you? I will laugh in the face of spell check.Hahahahahhahhahah..........

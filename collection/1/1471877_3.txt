commodity prices are a function of supply and demand. And, as others here have said...China is a BIG importer now of many commodities. In the US, our population is approx 300mm people. In China, (population 1.4bb)they have approx 300mm people who are eligible and able to work...but are presently unemployed. That is the population of the whole US!! The potential production force size from that country is staggering. And yes, they are building things for export and also building infrastructure right now. They are huge buyers of raw materials and that is definitely adding to the demand side of the equation. India is going in the same direction...tremendous tremendous potential there.

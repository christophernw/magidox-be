Chopsticks are the traditional Chinese/Japanese dining flatware.  Instead of a knife and fork, they use two carved sticks to grab their food. Usually one is held between the thumb and index finger and the other It is held between the index finger and middle finger.  It is their traditional belief that if your food needs to be cut with a knife that it has not been adequately prepared, hence no need for a fork and knife.

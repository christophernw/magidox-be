To me I believe that anyone who takes christ as their savior and asks forgiveness for thier sins will go to heaven. I am not sure what heaven is like. I would like to think that heaven would be whatever you wanted it to be. Any place, with any people. Kinda like in the end of Titanic. Where Rose goes back to the ship and she was young again and finds Jack on the top of the stiars by the clock. But thats a movie, I know. But I would hope whatever it is, that heaven is such a wonderful place that only the word heaven would really be the only way to discribe it. With everyone and everything that I have ever loved and have lost now, would be there waiting for me.

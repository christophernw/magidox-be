Octane rating, also if you're running an older turbocharged car and you up the boost pressure, it allows you to run more ignition advance (if it's an older turbocharged one with a Dizzy or programmable ignition like mine) and reduces Detonation experienced at higher boost pressures (Engine killer).. . Not much cop for your Mondeo 1.8 though.

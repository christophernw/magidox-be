Isn't that mobiBLU? Oh man, those are cool. In  any case, isn't the 1500i usb 2.0 connector with a jack? I don't know what kind of tower you have. USB ports may be located in the back or front. . . If it's an old computer, it may not even have a UBS port. 9 times out of 10 though, they'd be on the back.. . It'd help if you could mention the type of tower you've got.. . Source given is the manual/troubleshooting. Good luck.

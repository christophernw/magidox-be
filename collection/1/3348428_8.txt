Talk to them about the affects of smoking. Give them hope, just say you know someone who stopped and after about 3 days they were completely over it, ME, lol. It's so weird now its about 3 months and I don't see the interest in smokes and I was smoking 10 a day. Of coarse it may not be that easy for others but with support they can do it.

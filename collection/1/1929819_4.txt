I suggest you get some Hawaiin tapes. I recently was in Hawaii and bought some tapes just to learn how to Hula, but it really gives the legs AND abs/waist some really good work. The videos that we got were "Island Girl" videos. Mine is "Tahitian Hip Hop with Kili" - it's nothing like American hip hop, so if you're not into that don't worry. It's just a cultural thing, but they have cardio versions and stuff like that, so you should check them out! Plus, they're REALLY fun since you're learning a hula dance and working out at the same time!

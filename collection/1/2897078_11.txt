Strep Throat is not only treated with prescription antibiotics it is also highly contagious.  You need to go to the doctor ASAP or it will only get worse or you'll get someone else sick.   It might seem as it has gone away if you wait a while but the thing is it probably hasn't and if you get it enough you might have to have your tonsils taken out.

You pray for them AND for yourself. You may think that this sounds crazy, but it actually works!!! You pray NOT to have a rebellious, hateful attitude towards them. In order to be right with others, you also have to be right with God. You should try reading the Bible in  books Psalms & Proverbs. . My mom always tells me "The Bible will keep you from sin, or sin will keep you from the Bible."  Also, "A Psalms a day to keep me sweet; a Proverbs a day to keep me wise!"

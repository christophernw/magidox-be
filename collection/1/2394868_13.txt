This is not actually a racial issue, and probably not a cultural issue either. The mispronunciation of words like "ask" is a result of poor english education, usually found in poor urban populations. Whites, blacks, hispanics, asians... doesn't matter which race a person belongs to; if a person is raised in a low-income, urban environment, chances are that they have received sub-par english education, and therefore are likely to mispronounce words.. . I live in a middle-class, suburban community. About a third of my neighbors are non-white. NONE of them pronounce "ask" as "aks." On the other hand, When I spend time in urban areas, I hear about an equal proportion of whites and blacks pronounce it that way.

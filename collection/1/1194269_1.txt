Basic Economics; the law of supply and demand.  The demand is great, if you keep the supply limited, then you can charge a higher price.  So, if your own supply is held down, the only way to meet the demand is to import oil from across the sea which costs more, therefore also keeping the price up.  But don't be fooled.  There are various reports floating around that have found that a certain big oil company during the oil crisis in the 70's had tankers sent out past the territorial waters and sit there until the price of gas went up, then called them in as imported oil, and we the consumer paid import price for our own oil.  Imagine that.

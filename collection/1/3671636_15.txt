I don't understand why people laugh at others.  I believe all questions to be genuine and legitimate. Anyway people may find candy unhealthy especially for children who are just beginning to learn how to take care of their health and basically their teeth.  Besides, candy is available all over the grocery stores in bulk and its actually cheap. You may not make good money selling it.

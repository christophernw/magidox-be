We need to take the money out of running. $1 or $2 should be taken from every tax return, not optional, and split between the parties equitably. The TV ads should be donated time. So many 30 second spots and 2 or 3 debates for 3 mos. only.  We need to eliminate the Electoral College., and use popular vote. How to choose the candidate is a problem but maybe a primary in all states. And term limits. There has  to be a way for people of intelligence to run for office and not sell their soul to the devil to do so.

You are getting a check because you were a minor living with a mother that was disabled or retired. Or you were getting a check because you have some disability of your own. If you are not able to care for your own money you will have a payer who will manage the money for you. So it depends on why you were getting the money to start with.. . You can go to the Social Security office in your city. Take any documentation that you have and your social security card with you and ask them. Be careful about telling them that you moved out 4 months ago. You do not want to get your mother in any trouble. Just ask them if you move out of your mother's home are you still suppose to get any money.

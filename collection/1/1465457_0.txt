I've worked in social communication, environment campaings, environmental projects, adult education, helping deaf people integrate into a hearing society, and cultural stuff. And every time, I must honestly say, the experience gave lots more than what I could give back to my community. I'm grateful I had the chance to participate in every single thing I have, and though it has made me feel I have done too little, it has also led me to see how much other's can do and how many things I've got to be happy about.

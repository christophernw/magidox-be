Minority is another word for "race other than white".. Minorities don't have to necessarily be immigrants. English-speaking black people are considered a "minority". Immigrants can be non-minorities, like white people from Bosnia or something.. Then Mexican people, according to how they look, are considered minorities and immigrants.. Apples and oranges.

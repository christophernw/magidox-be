I"m sure He likes both your methods. Come to Him in Spirit and in truth. The needs of your flesh are of little meaning to Him.He cares about the Spirit since it is "in His image". So let your spirit do the talking, and truth is His Word, know it, learn it, say it back to Him.(He loves it!)He made promises to you, remind Him of them as King David and others did!

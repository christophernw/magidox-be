As a parent, it is tricky. There are some great programs on TV that I let my children watch, but I do have to monitor their time that they watch and what they watch. Sometimes even the cartoons are suggestive and sarcastic. I think that the problem starts when children just stay glued to the television and don't want to do anything else. I think that some parents use it as a babysitter with no regards to what their children are actually watching. And I think that producers of shows could offer more family oriented shows. Having said this, I think TV is both positive and negative and it is the responsibility of parents to take control and do what is best. I know my kids (12,10, and 4) would love nothing more to plant themselves in front of it all weekend long, but as their Mom, I find other things for them to do, after watching a few shows!

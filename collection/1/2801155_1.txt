That's a long process but to sum it up or at least try to... Glucose is broken down into 2 molecules of 3 carbons each(called pyruvate) in a process called glycolysis.  However this part does not require oxygen.  Oxygen is the final electron acceptor at the end of the electron transport chain...it is reduced to water by hydrogen atoms returning to the inner mitochondrial membrane when forming ATP.  NAD is the electron donor...it is where the oxygen gets the hydrogen atoms from...every time an NAD is reduced to an NADH that is where your hydrogens are going.  There are 2 reductions in glycolysis(both to NAD, but multiply that by two because u have 2 molecules of pyruvate)...there are 3 reductions in the citric acid cycle (two to NAD and 1 to FAD; FAD gets two hydrogens though making it FADH2) but u have to multiply that by two as well because both of ur molecules of pyruvate are going throught the citric acid cycle.  So if my math is correct there are ur 12 hydrogens and they all get donated to oxygen to form the 6H2O on the product side of the glucose reaction.  Hope that helps.

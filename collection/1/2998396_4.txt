That is a good question I know for a fact that they don't make a mess.  But I never thought to ask him.. Thats something no one helped him with.. I think he taped the handle of the urinal with his hand and lined up like that.. I know if you have a blind friend you should try to keep him from surfing, and maby golfing but he was better then some guys with sight. :)

At least you acknowledge the fact that some men do this.  You seem a nice sort who wouldn't do it deliberately and I think women would recognise the difference between a momentary lapse and a blatent ogle.  Some men do it with no shame whatsoever.  If this is the case, I always say "You can talk to them all you want, they will never talk back!".  This usually has the desired effect of making them blush.

Sweety there are miracles in our lives every day. Every mourning you wake up and you're alive, your house did not catch fire throughout the night, or wasn't invaded by thugs...you can open your eyes and see the sunlight, or even have the ability to move your body and think voluntarily those are miracles? Imagine how many peple in the hospital right now wishing they were living the miracle of your ordinary life...

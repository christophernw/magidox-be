It might sound like a lisp, but it's actually a different consonant.. . Speakers of Spanish in the Americas use an "s" sound for words that are spelled with "z", but some people from Spain use a sound like the English "th" in the same situation.  Therefore, a Spanish-speaker from Mexico might say "corazon" as "cor-a-son" and a Spanish-speaker from Spain might say "cor-a-thon".  This isn't a lisp; it's just a difference between the dialects of Spanish.

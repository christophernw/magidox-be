I asked the doctor the same thing; she said it is like that with any sickness because your body slows down at night, the weather changes because of those factors your body has to adjust so it can fight off what is making you sick. Fevers, coughs etc. are all signs that your body it trying to get rid of what is not suppose to be there! if that makes any sense to you......

A wolf in sheep's gear.. . The appearance disarms the community of vulnerables (of which we all are) and therefore lays them open to harm.. . It is also deplorably dishonest and very much like the character of satan, who worked from the beginning of his plot to show himself righteous at the same time he was sticking knives into everyone's back.. . How many people have been skrewd by folks like that? You can never be the same. The ability to trust is like gone in the owl's beak.. . But then a guy who thinks he's a bear, but discovers he's a fish has only put himself in danger. Not very evil.. . EXCEPT if he is like a big talking G-wannabe and gets his whole crew shot to pot. That's evil.

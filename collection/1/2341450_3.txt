glaciers change the land by crushing,grinding and pretty much using there enormous bulk mass in its process of movement. Originally they were rivers of water(running)which over eons of time have frozen due to drastic climate changes.In the case of glaciers an ice age. The result is many layers of frozen water becoming rivers of ice (very large at that). What remains is a glacier which continues to move but because it is so compacted and big(think iceberg) it literally gouges everything in its path. Inside of the glacier are rocks and debris which it picks up as it moves down river so to speak. as it moves over the land its sheer weight and bulk carves out all the changed landscape you see around it and behind it. The Grand Canyon in USA is a fine example of glacier force.

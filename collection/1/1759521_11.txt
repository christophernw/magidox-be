im pretty sure the dupont family had a lot to do with getting hemp outlawed, as it presented a threat to their production, hemp being a cheaper and renewable resource. Marijuana has yet to experience the acceptability of alcohol because of its "gate way drug" title,(which rightly belongs with the tobacco industry), and the outlandish propaganda of the government during the 60s and 70s. Also, millions of dollars are to be lost if a drug gets legalized because of lost jobs and the government will lose yet another avenue to pimp us out of our hard earned cash (the so called drug war)

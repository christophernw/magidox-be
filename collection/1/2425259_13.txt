To me, I think that murder is intentional and probably premeditated.  Killing, however, can be on accident, like if you are in a car wreck and a person gets killed: its not like it was done on purpose, but its still definetly not cool!  I would basically say that the difference is between getting the electric chair and getting a bunch of years in prison.

If the mass of the sun is 2*10^20 kilograms as "abisdad2004" said ... I wonder when this measurement was taken?  . . "Every second 700 million tons of hydrogen are converted into helium ashes. In the process 5 million tons of pure energy is released; therefore, as time goes on the Sun is becoming lighter."

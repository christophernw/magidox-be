If you want her to have the kittens in the house that sounds like a good idea. Usually they will hide in weird places where its hard for things bigger than them to get to. Ours hid under a dresser & had her babies and once in a closet. My mom had noticed the same behavior when it was close so she kept her in the house. . . I got my cat from a friend, her cat went up a tree and "dropped" her babies, my friend and neighbor had to catch them with a blanket. Cats will do weird things to get away from preditors and be alone. ;o)

Ohh goodness. I haven't looked for the TV guide channel in sooooolong....like 4-5 years or more.  I think it is because of the digital cable thing going on....but here is their website. . http://online.tvguide.com/listings/?NRMODE=Published&NRNODEGUID={723E490E-2074-4312-BA4D-EA15BB2FF788}&NRORIGINALURL=%2Flistings%2F&NRCACHEHINT=Guest. . maybe you can find the channel here for your area

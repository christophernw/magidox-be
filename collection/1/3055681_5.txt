buy a little electric rotary tool like a dremel, if ou get a kit it will coe with a cutoff wheel and some sandpaper and rotary fiels, so u can make a rough cut and the file it all smooth and make it look pretty, plus when you get a cd player you can get an installation kit which should come with a small fram so it will cover up whats left of the hole

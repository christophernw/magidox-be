This question can go either way.. If you want less taxes, stay single and live together. If you want a tax relief and plan to have kids then get married. If you like putting up with someone else and can tollerate someone else for the rest of your life then get married. If you want to stay out late and answer to no one, then stay single. If you want to pick up stuff when you want to and not get yelled at, stay single. If you want to have a smile on your face all the time and no gray hair....STAY SINGLE!

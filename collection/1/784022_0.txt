And I am a former ghost hunter-turned-skeptic. I wanted to believe they were real - but realized the more I examined the topic, the more it became evident that "there are no haunted places...just haunted people." Here's the logic: If ghosts were real, there should be no shortage of video evidence due to the large number of people that have died throughout the ages. What I find particularly annoying is every TV documentary on hauntings fails to provide video evidence even though they make statements like, "people often see the ghost", or "every year on the anniversary the ghost is sighted". If ghosts were real they'd be showing up on security cameras everywhere! If there are so many ghosts in graveyards, why has no one put a surveilance camera in one to capture them? People "see ghosts" most often at night usually being awakened from their sleep. I know from personal experience that there have been times when I've awakened being very frightened and confused because I thought what I was dreaming was very real. I have even "gotten up and walked around terrified" only to find moments later that I actually do wake up and discover that I had never gotten up at all - I was just dreaming I had. But I could have sworn I was actually up and walking around! I think ghost sightings are all apart of that unsettling experience. People are actually not aware that they are still asleep. The mind is a powerful thing and seems to like playing games with us. I hope this helps.

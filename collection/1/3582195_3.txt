ACLU- it is they who fight to take God out os school, when you know the kids of today NEED the power of prayer- and the fact they HATE Christmas... WHY HATE it??? Christmas has been around for many years, for families to get together, eat and celebrate, you DO NOT have to be a christian to celebrate christmas!. The ACLU are a bunch of angry ppl who have lived misrable lives, and probablly got nothing for christmas, that is why they are so sngry about that- but the other stuff..... it would seem they are almost ANTI- american???. what happened to freedom in THIS country- if ppl want to be gay, OK be gay but dont rub it in my face!. if ppl wanna pray to mohammed, OK go pray to Mohammed, but dont push it off on me!. If I want to pray to MY God Jesus Christ-- leave me alone and let me do it so, REMEMBER most of these ppl CAME to THIS country, and now are trying to CHANGE the way we live, celebrate, and do things here in USA! makes me ill!. I should be able to pray anyplace I wish, if they can bow down before a mohammed, why cant I have prayer in my school- if you are not christian, OK SO DO NOT ATTEND MY PRAYER GROUP- But WHY ruin it for all the others!?!?

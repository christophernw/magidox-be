Hi! I'm from Mexico!. I think like you.. but I don't call violent muslims, they are violent for us, but  they think taht they are acting so well, it's because they live with passion (ther feel their feelings too much).... and yes, for us they are 'bad'.... . if you read arabian nights by mardreus you will see that muslims have passion for all the thing that they do.. . I hope my answer help you, and the arabian nights help you to find out why muslims are very 'curious' for us.. . if so... my Id from yahoo is maurycarey tell me something if you liked arabian nights..

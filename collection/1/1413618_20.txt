Its not him we are afraid of, its everything he stands for.  Funny I don't think Fox says enough bad or nasty things about him.  I can't think of another ex that got this much attention, but then again I can't think of another president that did as much harm in office as he did, so maybe that's why we are still reeling from the aftershocks.

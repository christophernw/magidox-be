Stupid question here but have you tried to replace the relay? Could be an ignition relay. There is probably a black box under the hood there somewhere that contains some maxi fuses and relays. the cover of said black box has a fuse and relay layout. Look for the ignition ones. these are hard things to diagnose without being in front of it

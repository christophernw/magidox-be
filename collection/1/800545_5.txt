The key to getting a six pack is losing the body fat. You cannot simply spot-lose--as in, losing fat JUST on your stomach. Fat loss comes with overall body loss--so if you are chubby to begin with, you lose arm fat and lower leg fat before you lose fat on your waist, hips, and thighs. If you are skinnier to begin with, you lose fat on your torso--stomach, waist--since the other fat is already gone. The key to getting a six pack, thus, is to do lots of cardio (given you already have plenty of muscle.) Stripping the fat away, you will reveal your abs. Also--eating right is just as important, if not important, than simply hitting the gym. Building a killer body is about 30% gym and 70% nutrition.

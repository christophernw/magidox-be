It was an interesting story on TV, but intelligence showed too many flaws to be actual. . Probably another of Satan's many works to keep people off balance. He did take God's name out of many Bibles. Compare one of the very old King James, with the newer version.. Psalms 83 verse 18 as one example....Go ahead, don't take my word for it. It used to be there.........God's real name.

Actually turbos are not a new thing by any means. The first turbo went into service 1898 with the first real applications being just after WW1 in aircraft use. Turbos have gained renewed favor over the last number of years as EPA regs. force more and more restrictions on vehicles. A turbo for all intent gives your car FREE power. Being driven only by the engines exhaust it robs very very little power from the engine while giving back huge power gains. It is not "THE" answer to making all the power you want, it has limits, but it "ain't bad."

I think that is a "Wonderful- Idea!" Where I'm from, Long Beach,Ca. They have these coffee- shops, everywhere, now. This is my home town, I'm talking about. Where I live now only has one Star Bucks. But, in Long Beach, they have tables everywhere!! A bar, music... They even have tables & chairs, outside, all around their coffee shops. And it seemed like alot of "Raggae-typed" people hung there. It was a really cool atmosphere! Even, the music, you could hear a block away! Good, Raggae-type music! Folks could sit & read there, or just mingle. I think for the regulars, they even had a spot where they made their own, coffee! If I remember correctly.

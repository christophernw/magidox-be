because they are odd.. they are to conservative to realize what is actually happening in the world.  They don't believe in gay marriage.. what they do behind closed doors is there own business. They need to get it through there head.. Not every thing has to be perfect.. i'm not saying that gay marriage is imperfect. it's not.  I just think they need to be able to accept things like that.

Fear.... Fear that people will slam the door in their face. Fear that they will be spit on. Fear that they will not be strong enough to answer the questions they are asked. Fear that they will fail to do as God asked them to do. Fear that they will be thought a narrow minded bigot. Fear that they will be persecuted. . And I am only speaking about Christians.

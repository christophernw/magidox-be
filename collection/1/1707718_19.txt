I'm rather certain that most prehistoric people figured out that sex makes women pregnant.  They could observe that female animals get pregnant soon after mating and start drawing comparisons with humans.  Or the old and wise among them could ponder how babies get inside of women and eventually they'd notice that only women who'd had sex had babies later.  Eventually, the facts would come out and enter the oral traditions of the cave people.  Mothers would start telling daughters who had got their first period that men can make them become pregnant now.  I don't think that the prehistoric people were as stupid as some answerers seem to think they were.

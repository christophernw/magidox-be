NOT TRUE.  IF I EVER HAD TIME, I LOVE VIDEO GAMES AND NO YOU ARE NEVER TOO OLD TO HAVE A LIL FUN.  I ONLY LIKE ROLE PLAYING GAMES THOUGH LIKE THE HOBBIT, ZELDA, MEGAMEN, STUFF LIKE THAT.  THAT WAS THE ANSWER THOUGH.  WE DONT BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT.  WE WORK, GO TO SCHOOL, RUN ERRANDS AS MEN SIT ON THEIR ASSES WITH NO CARE IN THE WORLD IF THEIR XBOX CONTROLLER IS IN THEIR HAND.

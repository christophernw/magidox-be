I would explain that you need to have the day off for school registration.  Offer to make up the hours if the job requires it.  Any reasonable manager should honor your request.  Let them know this in a "need", not a "want".  If you don't register, you can't get into school.  And do you really need the whole day off?  Try to be flexible.  . . Since you are going back to school in January, it shouldn't be an issue.  The company knows this, right?. . My company always allows for my school requriements, but I do a lot via the web from home (NOT AT WORK) and my professors know that I work a fulltime day job.  They are flexible as is my company, but I have to sometimes put in extra time later at night or on the weekends. . . Think about your goal of graduation and what is the most important.

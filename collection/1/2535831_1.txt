I'm afraid I don't have a good answer, beautiful.  It was already mentioned, that there are many many cold viruses, which makes a vaccine next to impossible.  But one big reason for lack of effort trying to stop the common cold, is quite simply, what is to be gained?  The common cold never kills anyone, unless they are so debilitated that anything at all would knock them off.  And it is merely a minor inconvenience most of the time.  Once in a while, we suffer from the symptoms for a few days, but hey, who promised us a rose garden?  If that was all I had to worry about, I would be in utopia for sure.  LOL.  I'm sure the drug companies would love to sell a pill or nasal spray to cure the cold, as they would make billions.  But once you contact the virus, you get the cold very quickly, and it is well nigh impossible to stop it, once aquired.  As far as a preventitive, that would be more likely, but who is going to take a high priced medicine daily all year long?  These viruses come and go all year long and you never know when you are going to come in contact with a bad one.

I'm sorry to tell you, but the only correct answer is infinity. You see, infinity is a number that you can never reach. This being said, you can go no farther than to something that you can't reach. Picture yourself walking towards infinity. As fast as you go, you'll never get any closer. Since you can't get there, you can't get close to getting there. If you could get there, it wouldn't be infinity.

Humans laugh for one thing.  Another difference is artwork and music, the arts in general.  The most troubling difference is man's innate ability to be counterproductive when it comes to habitat.  I know, some species drive out others, but man is obviously enroute to destroy everything.  I would consider that a rather God-like quality.

Aveo has had an okay start with fiesta takin the pole position.. Personally i feel fiesta is a better car than aveo... Only adv aveo has over fiesta is the beige interiors which look good.. but as a car fiesta is slightly better... . General Motors network is not as good as that of honda or ford.. however in coming 2-3 years this will change..

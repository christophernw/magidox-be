First of all- God wants respect; and how could He not. He created us all and everything around us... why should loyaly humans deny this.... . Second- sex is not taught to be "the most awful, filthy thing on earth" if that's what was taught- why would they tell people to save some filthy for someone they love? Sex is merely for reproduction (and if you find pleasure out of it that's fine- but the main goal of sex IS reproduction) . . And No- God neither has nor needs sex.. . God Bless

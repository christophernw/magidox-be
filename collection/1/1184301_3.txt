I have the same problem. I have a 6 year old dog and whenever a stranger comes to our house, he doesn't stop barking even though we put him in a closed room. It's really annoying but I haven't figured out any tricks yet to keep him from barking. That's just what dogs do. You should probably play with your puppy rather than leaving her alone.

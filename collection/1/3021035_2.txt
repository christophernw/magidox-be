Having problems with distraction, organization and procrastination are all VERY COMMON signs of attention-deficit disorder (ADD), especially when you have all three of those problems together.. . And before people start criticizing me that I shouldn't slap a "label" so easily on someone, let me just say that I've struggled with the above three problems my whole life, and I tried so many different ways to deal with them, I won't EVEN bore you with everything I tried. But nothing really changed or helped much. Ultimately, I saw a psychologist who gave me a very in-depth self-evaluation survey to fill out and return to him. Based on its results, and ALSO based on his getting to know me as a person and hearing how I described my problems, he diagnosed me with ADD. . . When this happened, it was like 34 years of weight had been lifted from my shoulders! It all made sense. :) And I could finally stop criticizing myself for being lame, absent-minded, messy, procrastinating, etc. Of course, being an ADD person doesn't mean it's okay for me to "give in" to my tendencies. It just allows me to know I'm not simply crazy or lazy (hey, that rhymes!) I have a disorder that I am actively treating with counseling, meditation and medication. And I'm improving, finally! :). . I guess the point of my ramblings is that you might greatly benefit from knowing whether you have ADD. And if you do, you'll benefit even more from pro-actively addressing it and the ways it's harming your productivity and self-esteem. You can find some ADD self-tests on the Internet for starters, but it'd be best to talk with a psychologist (or a psychiatrist, since psychologists cannot prescribe meds).

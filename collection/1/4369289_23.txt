We don't die we multiply! No for real it's because the spirit realm is even more real than this physical one and death of the body is the only way to get there. Your spirit and soul is the real you and this life on earth is just a big school to learn how to love and seek God and other people. Life on earth in our bodies is like a short dream compared to our real lives in the spirit realm.  Many people who have had near death experiences all say death can be painful but it is nothing to fear and afterwards there is so much peace and tranquility in the spirit world.

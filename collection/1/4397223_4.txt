Used to drive a semi truck and was on the road 6 days a week,had one so bad it thumped when my heart beat!!!it gave me a head ache from the pain, so I took a needle and a bic lighter in my cab and lanced it myself! right on rt 70 east of Cols.put about a half tube of neosporin on it and worked the rest of week. havent been bothered since! but the blood was  a lot and it did itch for about a week!wore some bandages with neosporin on them for 3 days.

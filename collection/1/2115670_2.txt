If you consumed lots of alchol then go to work early the following day its almost impossible-especially if you drink beer or whiskey...the smell will be all over even if you shower....i used to drink alot then shower the next morning,brush teeth,chew mints and apply cologne but it could be smelled anyway in close contact.....try a clear alchohol like vodka and drink lots of water before retiring to bed,chew gum and mints the whole time your at work and dont get too close to anyone,but if your a heavy drinker theyll know because of your eyes and even your voice could sound different!

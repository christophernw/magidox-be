The best way to get a good location is to purchase an existing business.  Many of these carts can be purchased, typically for the amount of money that is generated (profit) in a year.  . . Alternatively, your friend should go investigate where there's a lot of foot traffic, near a school or near the bart stations.  Obviously your friend will need to watch during high traffic times like before or after school {and lunch time} and rush hour.

Man is an animal like every other... it's our conceit that places us as "higher" or "above" other animals, a conceit that is reinforced by religious teachings despite the fact that conceit is regarded as an unpleasant and undesirable characteristic by those same religions.. . But we are the ones deciding by what criteria we judge "higher" or "above". The most successful animal on the planet is actually Krill - if you judge by total living biomass. The animal most likely to survive a major meteor strike on the Earth is the cockroach, ant or possibly the rat. We patronisingly call dolphins intelligent but have no real way of judging how intelligent they are because we invite them to perform "our" tests - how good would we be at performing tests that they devised?. . All animals living today are equally well "evolved" or adapted to their environments or circumstances; otherwise they wouldn't still be alive. Man is only "special" because we say so - because we ourselves are "Men"; a dolphin, elephant, cockroach or amoeba might well disagree. Why is it that some people who believe in God cannot accept that God created a range of living things, one of which was Man?

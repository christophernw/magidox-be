Sorry to hear that your going through that situation. I honestly don't think people that can't empathize towards you can give you good advice.  I think you should join a support group. It's better to talk to others that actually know what you are going through.  Along with that, I say take it day by day and pray to God for strength.  He will supply all your needs and help you get through this difficult time.  I'll be praying for u. God Bless!

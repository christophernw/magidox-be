The friction generated by the atmosphere unto the exterior of your car while in motion is enough to charge the hull with a static electrical charge. This static phenomenum discharges through your body as you alit and make ground. . Take precautions when filling up the gas tank.. I usually ground out the gas fill nozzle on the car wheel before I address the gas tank. Be sure that the car wheel is not to hot.. Hope this works for you. Jose

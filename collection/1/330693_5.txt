God was pretty darn fed up because some of the heavenly beings were having sex with female humans and producing offspring called Nephilim. This is where we get all our old mythology about giants and demi-gods, by the way. Anyway, their behavior was so disgusting to God that He decided to clean things up with a great big gigantic bath!

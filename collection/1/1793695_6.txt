When someone says "he's suffering from alpha male syndrome" they are refering to a man that has to be the best of the pack, head of the herd, number one guy, narsacistic, I am the leader and noone can do better than me....type of guy. It's a reference to the animal world in which the males in a herd, or pack, fight to win the right as the "alpha male" who is the lead male of the pack, noone crosses him once he's achieved this position, until the time that his successor kills him.

Aggressive house spider bites generally require only local wound cleaning, topical antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis.. . I would do clean, some ibuprophen (Motrin)-you could also give them some oral antihistame (Benadryl) making sure you are dosing according to the directions only!!!! -maybe some anti-itch cream if its bothersome...a cool rag makes kids feel better.  Keep an eye on it...if it continues to become larger or she/he gets a fever or complains with addtional pain then hit the ER or call her/his MD to get them seen.

Absolutely nothing. They are victim feminists; victims of their own stupidity and ignorance. They probably feel very powerful now, but thats only because they are attractive. A personality and self image based on physical attractiveness is bound to be broken one day and all it will take is one snide comment from someone she is close to or whose opinion counts (like her breasts are starting to sag, or shes got wrinkles around her eyes.. you get the point) and she'll be whoring her ass off or snorting or both just to feel a little better. Ask them how powerful they feel when they are at 40... I would really love to know. Its just sad though how many womens lives they ruin by such behaviour.

I have to agree with RickieHart, i gradually moved the litter tray into the garden then removed it.. . I don't agree with house-bound cats being inhumane.. . I have a cat and he is definatley an indoor type. . He moans at me if i try to put him out!. . Just make sure that if you do keep your cat in, put them out after each meal, and if they stay in overnight, put them out for 10 minutes, otherwise they might wake you up in the middle of the night needing to go, or else you'll find a pressie in the morning!

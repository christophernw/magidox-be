I know exactly how you feel. I'm a Senior next year. You should definitely not be nervous. Gather your friends together and create a group, make sure everyone knows a meeting spot for lunch, and you'll be set. Now about the applying yourself thing, I have the same problem, and trust me, you definitely have to start worrying about your GPA as a freshman. There are many things I would have done differently had I known what it would be like. STAY ORGANIZED. The best way I've found is one of those accordion folding binder thingys. That way you don't have to punch holes in anything, you can just throw your papers in there and best of all you can sort them by subject, so you don't have to look through an entire stack of papers. but most importantly, have fun. hang with your friends, play a sport, an instrument, join a club. Find something that interests you and don't pass it up. try everything. you never know. You need something to help balance the studying. I am in Choir and I love it. I also played Softball, and Soccer for a while. But don't overload. oh, and don't shut out your parents. They are there to help you. don't listen to those people who say you have to learn to be independent and deal with things on your own. Yes, you will have to learn that, but don't start now. Your parents can help. let them help you with homework, even if it is just to check to make sure you're doing all of it. And i think that's about all the advice I have for you. just remember, have fun and don't grow up too fast!!!!! this is your time to have the time of your life!!

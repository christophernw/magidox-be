cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye. the lens is a clear disc within the eyeball. it is normally transparent & is situated behind the pupil. a cataract is like a dirty or cloudy camera lens. a cataract is neither a tumor nor an abnormal growth of tissue in the eye. it is due to physical changes in the contents of the lens, resulting in clouding. it is easily detected with specialised instruments by used doctors. surgery is the only effective way to remove a cataract.

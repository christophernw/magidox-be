The distinction between right and wrong is on a personal level. For primitive things like fire it's an instinctual mechanism.. .  We have the ability to conclude our actions before they are made. Whether it is deemed right or wrong is solely on the individual. Some animals do have a conscience. . .  The cat can conclude that eating off my plate while I am present is not a good idea from prior experience. Weather he learn it for a pattern or not it is intelligent to not make the same mistake twice.. .  Without a conscience a killer would not be so effective in our society. He would not know it is right or wrong and do it without caution of being noticed. "A killer without a conscience" is based off a society standpoint that it is ethically wrong to kill and all should know that.. .  A conscience is what it is a state of being and awareness. The individuals personality defines it. No one gave me my conscience but, me. I defined it as I lived and perceived things and developed my personality.. .  That is why children do not know right from wrong they are developing their conciseness from environmental factors like family, school, society.

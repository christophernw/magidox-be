It storms more in the afternoon than in the morning because the sun (in addition to creating all of the earth's weather) gives tremendous amounts of energy to weather systems making them 'stormy' as opposed to just 'rainy'. In reality the afternoon / early evening hours are the most common times for a storm (during the warm weather seasons at least) . . Cheers.

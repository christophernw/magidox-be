The importance of attending an HBCU is first of all to surround yourself with successful African Americans outside of the ones that you already know. Secondly, the importance of attending an HBCU is to learn the history of the school and realize that by attending the HBCU you are a part of history in the making. The last reason for the importance of attending an HBCU is to understand the true depths and lengths and sacrifices that African Americans made for and on behalf of higher education. To show that African Americans deserve and are capable of obtaining a sound, quality education and that it is the responsibility of those who have attended HBCU's to go out and become productive, contributing members of society.

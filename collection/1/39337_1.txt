We say that a bond is polar if valence electrons (those which take part in creating a bond) of two molecules (that create a bond) are closer to a nucleus of one of this molecules (this with higher electronegativity). . . Polar bond arise when the difference between electronegativities of two elements is 0,4 up to 1,7.

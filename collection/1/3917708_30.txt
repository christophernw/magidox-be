A horrible old man named Mr. Kawslawski, was my 8th grade math teacher.  He delighted in making a student go up to the chalk board first thing in the morning, and he would give that student a math problem to solve in front of the whole class.  I was not very good at math, so he picked on me continuously.  Greg Ramet ( I'll never forget him!) would "whisper" the answers to me.  I hope 'ol "Cows-louse-ski" as I used to call him went bankrupt, or something. Just look up "Jerk" in the old encyclopedia, his picture is there.

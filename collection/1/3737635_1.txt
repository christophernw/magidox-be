don't worry, your not the only one your age feeling like that. in fact most 25 year olds still don't know what the want to be when they grow up.  . good news: when it comes along, you will know. you will say this is it this is what i want to do(be).. i would suggest that you take business classes that teach you how to make money. in the end knowing how to make $ will give you the option to do or be who you want to be.

Recent history still has too much political baggage attached to it, and many people still feel very strongly about the issues that were relevant. If you notice, most history textbooks give a half-assed report of the 1990's through today. That's because too many people will rise up against the book if the authors try to put any personal information in it. For example, when a book says James Buchanan or Martin Van Buren was a bad president, there will be no objections, because they are dead and their parties defunct. If a book says George Bush Sr. was a bad president, there are still people alive to argue against that. Too much stress, so covering recent history broadly is easier for the book publishers.

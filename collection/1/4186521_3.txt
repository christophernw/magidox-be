for most i think its an easy rationalization as to why bad things happen......youll find that a lot of athiest will say "if god exists then why does life suck and why do BAD things happen to good people wouldnt god take care of his faithful followers........for orhers its more of a scientific reasoning and they tend to only believe what can factually be proven and explained with science. the strange thing about that is science has proven that FAITH of some sort is a natural necessity for humans in a psychological manor....for most of us we need to believe that we are not completely alone and that someone out there will always love us...faith has benefitted people in many ways proving that mind over matter is a possibility....aside from that ive generally found that most people claiming to be athiest are really agnostics because they do have a tiny place in thier brains that wonders

if I could pick and choose the kind of cars to sell,,it would be okay,,but if you work for a dealer,or any place that sells cars,,you have to seel whatever is on the lot,,a YUGO to a SUV,,,plus you have to deal with customers who always RIGHT,,,and then to top it off you will need to learn how to lie in order to sell the cars,,,just love the story about how the car was only driven on sundays by a little old lady,,,if I could sell only muscle cars,,yes it could be fun,, but now a days with the gas prices the way they are,,, going to be selling nothing but cracker boxes with a 4 cyclinder!!

How do we know that Joseph really buried him? remember the chamber was huge and more like a house with a huge rock as a gate. How do we know that Joseph was really protecting him from the sadistic jews and had to 'play-act' the whole scene to make the jews think that Jesus was really dead? Infact the jews got suspicious of the whole thing that they decided to check up to make sure he really had died...why did jesus hide in the garden and people thought he was the gardener? If Jesus had died and resurrected and can fly here and there and appear/disappear at will, why was the stone rolled from the grave? He could just walk through it...?

its the same as saying put up or shut up. . basically don't be hypocritical . . there is a good bible verse that explanes it quite nicely I unfortunately dont remember exactly where it is though it goes something like this. . dont try to remove the speck from your brothers eye til you first remove the plank from your own eye.. . you shouldnt tell people how they should live unless you are williing to live up to the same high standards that you set forth.. . it can also mean:. . you may talk a big game like i'm the best there is (at whatever). and you may brag about it (being the best at whatever) but then somone will come along and make you put your money where yout mouth is.  they will want you to not just say that your good they will want you to prove it. and you had better be able to do whatever your big mouth says you can.

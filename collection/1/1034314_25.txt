talk to the ones that you suspect to be gay and judge from the 'vibe' that you get from them and how they respond and react to you. you can tell if they are attracted to you by how you feel when you are talking to them and how they make you feel.Attraction is something that is felt..if you feel attracted ,congrats! you're officially queer! and if you deny it,good for you!it'll only become stronger!.

The proper cut to use is a cutlet.  Also known as a scallopini.  (Hence the name of the recipe.). . I prefer to use plastic wrap.  Spritz the sheets of plastic wrap with a bit of water, and the veal won't stick.. . The most important thing to remember is to start in the middle of the meat and move outwards.  This is the best way to keep the meat from tearing, and will give you the most uniform thickness throughout.. . You don't really need to hit the meat all that hard.  Your objective is to kind of spread the meat out, not smush it.. . The proper thickness is about 1/4 of an inch.  Much thicker and it will be kind of tough and chewy, and if you go much thinner it will probably tear.. . Yum!  Enjoy!  One of my favorites!

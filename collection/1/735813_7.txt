Cats that get neutered after they start spraying get into the habit.  Some stop after neutering, some don't.  There are also several behavioural reasons why a cat would spray.  It doesn't have to do with not letting him out of the house unless that was part of his routine before.  It has to do with stress, mostly.  Ask yourself what has changed in your house hold to stress him out?  Do you have less time to play with him?  New roommate?  Are you getting another cat's scent on you?  Once you understand that you can change the object of stress, or if that is impossible then there are several things you can do to discourage the spraying.  (Do an internet search.)  I guarantee though, it will take a lot of patience on your part.

to be honest i didn't know about it! i'm glad i got informed. and like one of the other people above me said it's because brittany dumped kevin federline (yay!), it's because people just don't care anymore which is a real shame! i'd rather have them not hang him bc there is still a chance that he could live through it-it's happened before unfortunally! i am only 13 and i relize this when people who are 23 don't even care! i wish that there were more people who cared in the world!

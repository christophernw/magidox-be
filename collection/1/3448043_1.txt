just the type of x your getting it can let you know how good and clean the pill is (if the pill is blue and there is a dolphin stamped on=blue dolphin) but it all depends on your area. nowa days the marking mean next to nothing because people will try and make some bad x or fake x and stamp it with the marking and make it the same color in order to make thier pill seem like its higher quality and make more money subsequently. when you do x make sure the pill your getting isn't laced with any methenphedimines or anyhitng else that isn't mdma. there is a bit more info here http://www.ecstasydata.org/ also check out http://www.erowid.org/. . be smart with what you put in your body, be careful, and have fun.

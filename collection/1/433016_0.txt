I'm guessing here, but I think he may be referring to the Christian idea of the "old covenant" in the Tanakh, and the "new covenant" of the New Testament. Two laws.. On a side note I find his Q&A fascinating. When he's on, he comes up with some really clever stanzas. Seems a little out there quite often, but he truly has the soul of a poet.

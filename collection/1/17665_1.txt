If there are eggs in it,let them hatch(takes about 2 weeks from the time they are laid)then destroy the nest,and put some blockage there to discourage the  birds from nesting  there in the future.If you can see inside the nest,it's quite fascinating to watch the baby birds hatch.You can put a bird house on a pole on your property for future birdy familys.Good Luck.

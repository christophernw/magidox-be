Because when Clinton was President, he mandated that all legal documents be printed both in English and Spanish so he could get more of the Hispanic votes. I wish Bush would mandate it back to where all federal documents are ONLY in English. It sucks that people don't even try to learn the language anymore. What happened to "One Nation Under God". Our ancestors came here from many difference countries, but the one thing that bound them as Americans was the language. With so many different languages being used here, we are loosing our unity. . . I hate it when our Governor (Heb) comes on TV during hurricane season and does the emergency broadcasts in Spanish. Just makes me mad so I have to turn it off.

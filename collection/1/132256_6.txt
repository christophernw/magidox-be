Though you may take only an intellectual stand on politics and economics. They are what drives the country that people, whom have emotions, live. People love the country they live in, and the ideas they believe it stands for. So when others have differing ideas or beliefs that stand against ones own ideas it's only human nature to get emotional. If one didn't get emotional, could one really say one believes in what one preeches.

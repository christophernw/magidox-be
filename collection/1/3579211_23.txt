I know there are programs that boast that they can change you from being gay to straight but I just don't believe it. I think deep down inside you would not be happy if you are truly gay to begin with. Christian fanatics will tell that you are going against god's way however as a religious scholar I can tell you Sodom and Gomorrah is thought to be an added in chapter of the bible, and it is quite possible that did not even occur. I apologize if my answer offends any one, but I just don't believe it's healthy to change who you are. I mean if you truly want to be straight and you can't be? That should tell you something.

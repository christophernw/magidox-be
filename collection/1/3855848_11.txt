I agree that immigration is an exaggerated problem, because if it was so bad it would have been brought up years ago.  Honestly, I wish that everyone had the opportunities that Americans have, so I understand why people do cross the borders, but many are being exploited and I think the government should find a better and faster way to make them citizens because, honestly, the only thing that is different between Americans and the people who come to America is the country that they were born in.  I don't feel that immigration is hurting the america people as much as the war is.  I believe this because immigration has not driven up the gas prices and it has given many people the chance to live a decent life.

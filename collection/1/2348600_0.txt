Ask your son...seriously. Talk with your son about why your relationship troubles him. It may be just the selfish nonsense most children(of any age) feel when mom starts dating, but he may have some real concern...we have no way to guess what those concerns might be, so sit down with your son, alone, and simply ASK him...and be truly willing to hear him out.

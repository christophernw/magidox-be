There is a moral reason, a practical (self-interested) reason, and a logical reason for having rules of civilized warfare.  . . The moral reason is that unnecessary killing is wrong per se.  . . The practical reason is that "the first shall be last" one day, and if America some day becomes a battleground, or even if you are an American soldier captured abroad, you wouldn't want your enemy to have any additional incitements to torture or unnecessarily kill you than the stress of war already creates.. . The logical reason is that since public war fever is typically stoked with propaganda stories (some true, some not) about the wholesale cruelty of the other side, behaving like the other side undercuts a major reason for the war taking place.

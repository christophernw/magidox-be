Ive never heard them but they are included in my near future system, my friend has an Eternal, which is a step down and it pounds, doesnt distort at all even turned up, has it hooked up to a 2400watt max amp. I would suggest them, however I have a high excursion sub (audiobahn) which on the audiobahn website is one below the flame compression sub AWT126T <which I used to have. My high excursion hits just about as hard pushed through the same amp, but the settings are different.

Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a prime power of two. For example, 31 (a prime number) = 32 − 1 = 25 − 1, and 5 also a prime number, so 31 is a Mersenne prime; so is 7 = 8 − 1 = 23 − 1. On the other hand, 2047 = 2048 − 1 = 211 − 1, for example, is not a prime, because although 11 is a prime (making it a candidate for being a Mersenne prime), 2047 is not prime (it is divisible by 89 & 23). Throughout modern times, the largest known prime number has very often been a Mersenne prime.

In the Bible, Jesus is called the Lamb of God. He died for our sins so that the slaughter of the thousands of lambs could end, sacrificed for the sins of people by the Jewish tradition.. . Seen this way, Jesus sacrificed himself for the animals, so that our sins are forgiven by his body and blood, remembered in the sacraments of bread and wine (vegetarian foods).. . Jesus was of the Essene group, a vegetarian group. Yet, he was not fanatic about it, as the scriptures tell us. He met the people where they were to teach them, instead of judging them. Jesus taught us, "Love one another.". . Many Christians of today misunderstand Christ's message: they may judge those of different belief, but they themselves may return from the Easter Mass to eat - lamb!. . The early Christians were vegetarians as were many Saints and great inventors like Nikola Tesla, the greatest inventor of all times. I feel choosing vegetarian food is a kindness we can show to our animal brothers and sisters, who like us have families they love.. . Paradise on earth cannot be manifested without freedom for all beings, and that no being has to be afraid of another.. . Happy road to Paradise, step by step!. Cordially, India.Magica

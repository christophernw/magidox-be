If you mean Easter Day it is the Sunday after Good Friday when, according to the Bible, Mary Magdalene went to Christ's grave to find the stone rolled away and Christ risen from the grave. The actual date, like Christ's birthdate is not known so, like Christmas, the early Christians incorporated the festival to co-incide with pagan festivals as a way of convincing them that their god, Christ, was the same god that they worshipped.. . The resurrection is part of the reason that Jews do not accept Christ as the Messiah, or saviour, since according to the Scriptures, the Messiah does not die, so if Christ did die he cannot be the Messiah even if he rose from the dead. However  in the original biblical Hebrew at the moment of Christ's 'death' it states that he 'gave up the ghost' and expired. The word used is 'ruachim' which can be pronounced in two different ways either 'roo-ack-eem' or 'roo- ach-im' (the second one saying ach as in the German word 'ach' with an aspirant). The second word means 'breath' not 'ghost' so that if Christ just exhaled a long breath and the Romans thought he was dead his body could have been taken down whilst still alive. This means that he would still have been alive until the Resurrection and so could be the Messiah because another biblical prophesy says that, as far as the Messiah is concerned, 'no bone of his shall be broken'. Since He was nailed to the cross and a spear stuck in his side how could this be? Simple. The nails went between the bones on his hands and feet, which were then tied on to the tree (Not cross. The Bible calls it a tree), so that the flesh did not tear and rip bones out, and the spear penetrated between the ribs.. . Hope that explains it for you, but if you meant'Ester Day' then I assume that you are aware that ester is an alcohol and the day in question is one for getting drunk as a skunk!

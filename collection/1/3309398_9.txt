Sure, To me, spiritual means to be in touch with that higher force, the thing that is in all of us.  The loving, caring, trusting, and giving part.  From this comes great strength, discipline, and serenity.  To me spiritual growth means knowing what is right and being able to do it without reservation or fear.  Having a sense of purpose and direction regardless of your goals, situation, or status.  It's just my opinion, but I equate spiritual growth being proportional to overall happiness and satisfaction with life.

I would ask for the parents numbers and update them about the great progress their child is making. Why not do something special for the student who has improved in a month and ask the parent to join in and discuss your desire for them to come to, observe and participate in their activities and plays? I hope everything works out because the children are lucky to have you as a teacher. If they are failing, please send home a note or put a comment on the paper of the test or exam they failed that you wish to have a conference on how you can help their child improve. Also, you can be old fashioned and ask can you do a home visit to discuss their child's progress because nowadays people are sometimes busy working and just don't have the time to come by the class.

When you're unhappy with yourself and your own life (consciously or un), even feeling incompetent, we tend to want what we can't have/get.  We get depressed when we don't get what we want, and then give up, and then we want more, but then we get depressed again...the cycle goes on like that.. . People that are happy are generally happy with what they already have so they don't care to want anything (that they can't have/get).

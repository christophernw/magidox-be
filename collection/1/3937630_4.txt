The myths have been perpetuated since the Salem witch trials...its not just Hollywood.  It's society in general.  People tend to fear what they dont' understand, and staying in the mainstream is safer.  If everyone else believes it, then I should because it's the "right thing" to believe.....like our other traditional and more mainstream religions.  Some people just cannot open their minds and hearts to different beliefs....being brainwashed as children that their religion was the "right one".  Hollywood, of course, capitalizes on this basic fear we all have of witchcraft and the like (voodooism, hoodooism, etc. - watch the movie The Skeleton Key), and as long as there is money to be made, they will continue to proliferate non-truths and exaggeration for profit.

Another cultural or religious based way of torturing a female and to put her in her place.  . . The justification for this is that (in the minds of these religions and cultures) is to help the female stay a virgin or not stray -- because they supposedly do not feel any stimulation during sexual contact.  . . This is just sick and the practice (mostly in closed social settings) is finding it is being viewed VERY NEGATIVELY and as a FORM OF ABUSE of FEMALES by the entire world.

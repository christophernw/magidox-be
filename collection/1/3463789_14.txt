Because people disagree about little things. Example the church of Nazareans believes speaking in tongues is key to knowing God. I can tell you right now that's not the case. (No offense meant to them, it came off the top of my head). If we just focused on the core beliefs and not all the little stuff that won't really matter in the end, we could be one church. Wouldn't it be more pleasing to you if you were God to just have one church? Not a billion different churches who disagree about little things that in the end don't even matter. You're very right. There should be one Christian church. That is the way God intended it. Unfortunately, little things tend to matter to people of today. However, like I said... in the end, they won't, and there will only be one church. Who will they be made up of? Those who have fully accepted Him.

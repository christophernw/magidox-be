Those are two pretty high-ticket items.  I agree that you should make the point by asking only for those two things, but if you don't get them it doesn't necessarily mean that your Dad doesn't love you.  He may not be able to afford to buy both of those for you.  My son wants an XBox 360 and I would love to get him one but my wife has been out of work for over a year and I just don't have $300.00 to shell out for one.  Maybe by the time his birthday rolls around I could save it up...this is the reality of being an adult and a parent -- see what you have to look forward to?

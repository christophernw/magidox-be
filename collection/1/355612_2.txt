Request to move.  If your requests aren't approved then sabotage the wall jack the fax plugs in to.  This can be done fairly easily with a screw driver (flat head).  The jack has contacts that connect inside with the fax connection wire.  If you jam a flat head screwdriver in to the hole one night late in the evening when nobody is around you can break those contact wires and the fax machine will no longer work.  This will force them to move the fax machine elsewhere because unless they replace that jack entirely it will never work there again.  You could also use a soldering iron and a bit of soldering wire to melt the contacts in the jack together.

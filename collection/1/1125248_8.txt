from an evolutionary point of view, we didn't evolve from apes, but we evolved from a common ancestor.  and there are things alive today that are "millions of years old" (like ginko, it has been called a "living fossil" because it hasn't changed since early in the fossil record) but from my point of view it is because we were created by God.  and in reply to those who say that creation is not science, i'll agree with you, but it does have much scientific evidence supporting it.  but if you say that creation is not science,  you also must admit that evolution is not science.  both are based on interpretation of the same facts, and neither one is repeatable or observable, so neither one is actually science.

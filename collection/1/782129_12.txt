WELL, MAY BE YOU WON'T LIKE MY ANSWER BUT JUST AN ADVICE: -. WHAT I BELIEVE IS GOD LIVES IN EVERYONES HEART AND IF YOU NEED ANSWER TO YOUR PRAYERS JUST TALK TO THE GOD SITTING INSIDE YOU! START BEILEVELING IN YOURSELF.... ALSO, IF YOU'RE CONFUSED ABOUT SOMETHING CLOSE YOUR EYES PUT YOUR HAND ON YOUR HEART AND JUST IMAGINE YOU'RE TALKING TO GOD YOU'LL GET YOUR REPLIES...... JUST KEEP SMILING!

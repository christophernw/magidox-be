First off you let her LOL, if you know she's going to do this stop her at the pass and pull her away from it ASAP! Good Luck!. P.S. put a light weight sweater on her before going outdoors that may help and then take it off of her and rub it in her face and tell her NO! She'll eventually get the hint.

It's "cut to the chase," my friend.  It is a reference to movies.  Cut to the chase means fast forward to the good part or get to the pointe already.  Cut through the chase - I don't know.  It doesn't seem to make sence.  How does one cut threw the chase anyway?  And where would one be after they had cut through?  After the chase?  Then you've missed the best part.  I can't picture it.  It frustrates me so.  Makes me want to bite my landlady, or skin a stray cat.  Thank you, sir, you are an Easter Island statue.  Goodbye!

If you can't get to a vet, which is the real answer to your problem he'll treat the fleas with frontline plus and he will have to treat the cat for the worms.....he can fix your cat right up, it is worht the money spent to prevent it from happening in the first place, if you can't get to the vet, go to a pet store and ask for frontline plus for cats...ask them to explain to you how to use it...and I really can't tell you how important it is to take the cat to the vet for the worm treatment....

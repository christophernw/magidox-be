Song of Solomon 2:1 "I am the rose of Sharon, And the lily of the valleys.". This book of the Bible is a love song written by Solomon. Historically it depicts the wooing and wedding of a shepherdess by King Solomon, and the joys and the heartaches of wedded love.. Allegorically it pictures Israel as God's betrothed bride, and the church as the bride of Christ.. I know this does not answer your question completly but it does kind of give a background to where the verse is and what the Song of Solomon is about.

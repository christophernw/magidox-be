I am an aethiest so I don't believe in any form of God.  However, as I know many different people from all forms of Christianity then their explanation is to enter into heaven then they must accept god and follow th eten commandments.  Ergo, if you don't let God into your life then you must be going to hell.. Although it isn't the nicest thing to say to someone but all realigions seem to work on the fear principle (if you don't do this or you do certain things bad things will happen to you) so this is just Christianity's way of making people behave and 'find god'.

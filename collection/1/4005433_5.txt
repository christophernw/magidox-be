The first response hit it right on the mark.. . Just being born proves you're good enough since you received the gift of life.. . Often, people judge their worth by their effect on the world. That's not right to a great extent. You first have to accept yourself and be the person you imagine yourself to be.... It's a constant struggle with yourself. And once you reach that certain comfort level with yourself, everything else seems to fall into place.

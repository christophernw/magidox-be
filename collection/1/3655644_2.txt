I feel it's more the other way around in that the public schools want to teach our children their politically correct morality.. Check out the National Education Association's website and read some of their agendas for public schools.. Some members believe that our children do not belong to the parents, but rather the U.S. governments, while the parents a more like stewards.. Some goverment entities also want to control our kids from cradle to grave in education, jobs, political indoctrination, because they believe they know better than us parents whats best for our kids, because they're in government, and we are not.

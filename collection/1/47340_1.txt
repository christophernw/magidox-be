I would think a CD scratch remover, do they make one? Hum if they do, that might be what they call it.. .  I use a CD cleaning system from Wal-Mart, Keeps Cd's and CD player at peak performance. I am going to add this too... Block Buster movies here are always skipping and freezing. When I use this CD cleaning system it really works. You might have to do it 2 times though depending how bad the scratches are.

Nah--lots of creatures can lay eggs--fish, reptiles, amphibians, other birds, monotremes, insects, arachnids, crustaceans.  Even regular mammals have eggs, though they do all their growing within the body.. . And some of these creatures were laying eggs long before there were chickens, so that question's really rather easy.

I'm not strong on Spanish (high school, 35 years ago) but I recall that it means "to like" or "to please". (Gustar - the infinitive).. . A mi, me gusta la leche.. For me, I like the milk.. . If I recall, it's passive and backward - more literally, "The milk pleases me." Hence, the 3rd person "gusta" not 1st person - "yo gusto" is wrong. I think it also applies to liking things, not to people.. . I don't know how it's applied in slang or colloquialisms...

In is the term used in a slang and slanderous way about an American Native. As the white man had barter and exchange methods, they never considered the native to be intelligent enough to also have these methods. Which is highly insulting, to anyone. Just because someone does not speak your language does not make them ignorant. However a native would go into a dry goods store and take his furs and trade them for items needed and that was fine. But when the natives lent things like their land their water, their horses,  the white man kept these things without a trade or even exchange. So the native would want his land and his waters, his horses his gold, his silver, his copper, his iron, his everything back or at least a piece of the action, the white man killed the native and called him an Indian Giver. Just like today here in America with the Gimmee this Gimmee that for free tribes in all creeds, colors and races.

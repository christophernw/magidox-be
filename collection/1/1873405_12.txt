I BLAME BOTH.. . Big corporations hire you because Americans will not tolerate slavery...which is exactly what they get from you... slave labor.. . Big corporations need your cheap labor force because Americans refuse to work for peanuts. It has been a long hard road getting to the point where corporations pay semi-decent wages to strike a balance between their workforce and their customers - who happen to be one in the same.. . Corporations need higher skilled workers because illegal aliens are overcrowding our schools which is dwindling our resources for legal children who are not properly learning what they need to know to be highly skilled workers...and that's all due to illegal aliens and their children.. . They need bilingual personnel to communicate with the slaves, uh, er, I mean undocumented workers.. . You wont find a stronger or harder working class of people in all of the world, just people who are willing to work for much less which allows for a standard of living that American Citizens won't tolerate.. . Why?????? Why don't you go back to where you belong?...MEXICO! Head south buddy!

A Religion starts when some one has a new Idea. All of the Old religions hate that one because they did not think of it. It is a process of evolution. Survival of the fittest..   Also there is a process of uniting going on among the churches all becoming one so all of the Old ideas about us only are dying so that the Anti-Christ can rule the world, ha ha ha

Look at the casting number on the block.  There's a small machined pad that sticks out just past the intake on the front of the engine, it will have the casting number stamped into it.  You can use this number and call your local dealer and they'll tell you what it was orignally in, what size it is, and possibly the original horsepower rating.  As far as appearance, unless you look at the harmonic balancer, the engines look identical (283, 305, 350, 327, 400).  The 400 uses a smaller, I think 6.25" balancer, where as the others use a larger, which I think is 7.5".

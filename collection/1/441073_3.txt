Eat less and exercise more. There's nothing more to it than that. Eat what you like, but if you eat too much of it, start working  out more. One easy thing to do is switch from regular sodas to diet sodas. Think about this:. . If you drink 2 regular cans of soda per day, your consuming 300 calories. There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat, so if you switch to diet sodas with 0 calories, it will take you about 11 days to lose a pound of fat without doing anything! Add to that a good aerobic workout 3 days a week and you'll be on your way.  Good luck and good health to you!

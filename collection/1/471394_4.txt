WAIT A MIN...I am a Christian...and I am far from stuck up.  I am not perfect...and do not act that way. I smoke, I cuss, I have a good time...I also read my Bible (when I can) and know what it says.  I am there when the doors are open...and I love being there.  Pentecostal by the way.  I can talk to anybody...and everybody in my church is very down to earth.  I must agree with you...there are a lot of snobby (mostly rich) people in some churches...mostly baptist, methodus-sp, presbyterian.  I don't know why...but, not all of us are that way.  I see you said you used to go to church...look for a pentecostal church...you will never find a more friendly bunch...and you must have been going for a reason.

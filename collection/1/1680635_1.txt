In Europe, a salad is served after the main course because it is believed to aid digestion. The custom in the U.S. was first started in restaurants -- to give the diners something to eat while their main course was being prepared. Americans expect to be served fast -- and they just couldn't wait for that steak to be cooked to a delicate medium-rare.. . The habit of serving the salad first was carried over into homes, where is now the norm.

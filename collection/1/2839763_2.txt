A panic attack and anxiety attack are the same, and used interchangeably.  Panic attack is the actual technical term.  You can be diagnosed with panic disorder with agoraphobia (an extreme fear of leaving the house and/or being in open spaces) or panic disorder without agoraphobia.  Either way, it's a highly treatable disorder with the use of exposure techniques, or a slow step-by-step process involving gradually assimilating to each element of a feared situation until the anxiety significantly decreases.

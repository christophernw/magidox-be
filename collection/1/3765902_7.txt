It is interesting to me how people will generalize to the point of being ridiculous!  I am speaking not of the question ask er, but the the answerers! It is true that some Americans are too prideful and think that America is the ONLY country in the world.  But to imply or state that all Americans are this way is a LIE! . . America is and always has been the most generous country in the world.  We have taken care of literally millions of poor in other countries. Countries that have governments that ignore their poor. . . People of the world get angry if we do not help THEM. Then they turn on us. AMERICA!  It is a fact that even America has it's limits.. And now that we have helped other countries gain thorough our help, we find ourselves loosing world share in the world economy.  We simply can not keep giving to the entire world. It is time that the rest of the world contribute it's fair share. More American lives and money have been given to causes around the world, than any other country, in peace time. When will the rest of the world step up.  (I am not including the Iraq war in this example. And I am not forgetting the British, or Australians etc. that have pitched in over the years. I am speaking of the countries like China and Russia that pay very little to the world cause.). . You would find, if you were here that most Americans see them selves as part of a world family. And do not feel supirior to any one. I will conceed however that the iristocratcs here seem to feel that they are supirior to everyone else. (Many are our politicians. Clintons, Kerry, Dean, Mr. Bush himself.). . This only my opinion. I do not speak for all Americans.

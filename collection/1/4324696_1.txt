When Jesus stood before Pilate, Pilate said to Jesus, "Truth!  What is truth?"   The answer is: Truth is the One Who stands before you.  Pilate did not recognize Jesus as truth.  If you seek truth in religion, look to Jesus.  You  may have  to give up your preconceived notion of truth in order to recognize Him.

You can solve problems buy spending more time with teens to really see how they feel about stuff in the world instead of stamping a label on them and shipping them off like somebodies mail. Stop wasting so much money in wars and give them some thing to do. people need to stop complaining about all the gang problems and do something about it. Not because you have to because you want to. Some people don't have parents to go home to like others take the time to try to be the parent they never had. If every person that complained took the time out to care gangs in the youth of African Americans would not be a problem.

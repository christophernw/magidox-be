Homogeneous nucleation. Homogeneous nucleation occurs in pure water in which there is no contact with any other foreign substance or surface. With homogeneous nucleation, the conversion of the liquid state to solid state is done by either lowering temperatures or by changes in pressure. However, temperature is the primary influence on the conversion of water to ice or ice to water is temperature. . . In homogeneous nucleation, the nucleation begins when a very small volume of water molecules reaches the solid state. This small volume of molecules, is called the embryo and becomes the basis for further growth until all of the water is coverted. The growth process is controlled by the rate of removal of the latent heat being released. Molecules are attaching and detaching from the embryo at roughly equal and very rapid rates. As more molecules attach to the embryo, energy is released causing the temperature of the attached molecules to be lower than the temperature of the unattached molecules. The growth rate continues until all the molecules are attached. At this point, you have the solid state (ice).

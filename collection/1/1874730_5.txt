I'm very honest. The only lies I tell are christmas or birthday lies. That's when you lie a little so some one doesn't find out thier present or a surprise you have planned.(I learned this from my mom) I am not brutally honest though. I hate to hurt some one's feelings. If there is e gentle way to put something I do.

I just lost my baby (corgi, dachshaund, terrier) of 15 years. I was an absolute basket-case. She was my 'child'. We traveled, ran errands together, went to work with me sometimes, and had been through 5 relationships with me. LOL Well, it's been already 4 months, and I'll just know. And you know what? You sound like you loved your dog as much as I loved mine. And you probably have alot of love to give to another dog. I'm almost there. Life is too short. There are so many dogs at shelters that need good homes and loving owners. So just keep your heart open. Anything is possible! Good luck

Again, like everyone said, it is the rearrangement to a different, usually more stable isomer.  This is mostly commonly the keto-enol tautomerization, where a ketone transitions to an enolate.  Interestingly enough, can be seen in DNA, often in pyrimidines, which causes base pairing to vary from the normal G-C A-T to an unusual pairing of A-C G-T.  Also important in Organic Chemistry.

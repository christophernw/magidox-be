Vodka straight is definitely an acquired taste.  It doesn't really have a taste to it which is why it's commonly put with orange juice or tomato juice or clamato juice.  However, I have tasted Vodka's at Food & Beverage shows which were rather nice.  Think of drinking really crisp and clean ice water but with a burn on the way down and you'll be getting close.  Personally, $50 might be a bit much for a bottle of Vodka but it depends on what brand it is.  My favourites are Smirnoff or Iceberg Vodka, which is the one that tasted like crisp & clean ice water.

As others have pointed out, MD indicates that an individual is a Doctor of Medicine.. . What many people don't realise is that phyisicians in the UK qualify (in the first instance) with the degree of MB CHB (a combined Bachelor's degree in medicince and surgery). The title 'Dr' is therefore purely honorary - unlike the title relating to the degrees of MD and PhD.

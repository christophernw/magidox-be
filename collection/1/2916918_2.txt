Everything smells like anti semitism to most Israelis  and I am sick of it   When will you jerks realize that you are in a religious state - and when someone speaks out against Israel, he is not necessarily anti-semetic - it just means they disagree with the policy of your government.  While we are talking about the Jewish State - when will Israel give us its illegal stockpile of nuclear arms?    I woul dlike to see the US begin to distance itself more and more away from Israel and would also like to see us curtail the defense "gifts" in foreign aid we send you --- and if you think that makes me an anti Semetic - Then Damn it, I am, and I am proud to be one....

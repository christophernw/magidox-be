The most important is the use of LED's as the light.  These are highly efficient lights, therefore you do not need much power.  Add to that a small battery and generator (shake or wind up) and you have the flashlight.  . . I like the lights with the little cranks the best.  Crank for 1 minute, light for 1 hour!. . I have read many predictions that LED's will be the norm just about everywhere in 10 years.  Edison's bulb last a whopping 100+ years before being out done.

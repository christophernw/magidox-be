You just put it in your handbag and take the seat. If the person comes by and makes a fuss, you can hand them back their tissue, ask them to point out where it says on the tissue or the seat that they had reserved it, then continue eating. I think the reason S'poreans get away with this kind of silly behaviour is because others are too polite to say anything about it!

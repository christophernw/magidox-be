Think of the people you will leave behind.  I had a brother who killed himself and I wish he would have thought about how much this would effect the whole family before he did it.  I understand why he felt like he needed to go, but I wish he would have knowen how much he would be missed and how things WILL get better....they will...I promise you, they will.  I was in a depression faze after he died and I tried the whole suicide thing right after his death...IM SOOOOOOOOOOO GLAD it didnt work, life DOES get better.  If ya need someone to talk to, you can email me.

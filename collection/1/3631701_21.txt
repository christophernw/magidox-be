They have this machine at certain electronics locations that basically sands down some of the plastic on the disk and re-polishes it so that it can be used again.  The cost for this is usually $1/disk.  If you cannot find this there is another gadget that my hubby and I purchased that does the same thing...we purchased it from best buy...you plug it in place the disk in and it repolishes/fills in the surface.  It cost about $14.95 but when you think about the cost of one CD we thought it was worth it.  It worked pretty well on some of the lighter damage but we had one that had a huge crack in it and of course we just had to count it as a loss.

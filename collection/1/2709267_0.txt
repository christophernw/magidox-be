Catholicism is the original Christian Church, founded at the time of Christ. Catholics follow the Pope as the successor of St. Peter, and also believe in asking saints in heaven to pray for them (much as they might ask a friend). The Church also has more traditions than most Christian denominations, since it has existed for so long.

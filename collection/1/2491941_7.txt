The South is a very important part of our nation, and contrary to what you state, it is not filled up with rednecks (there are some out there for sure, but the South is more racially integrated now than even the north).. . Plus, just because you disagree with the vision of the "red" states -- free markets, freedom from excessive government intervention, a strong national defense, family values, respect for the principles of our founding fathers.. . . Some people might argue that it is the blue states that should secede, because they represent many things that are incompatible with the principles on which this nation was born.  However, I disagree with that.  Our diversity is our strength, and the fact that we have two sides with different, clearly defined points of view, makes for a healthy debate.  Actually, last presidential election we had a real high number of people voting.

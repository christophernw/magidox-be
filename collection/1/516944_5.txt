Because a woman usually (hopefully) will weigh less and not drink quite as often. No, it's not because you're paying, besides, if you are the one paying, aren't you glad she gets drunk faster? It saves you money! Maybe you should just try to find a real woman who knows what she's doing and can keep up with you instead of getting drunk and being basically useless the rest of the night.

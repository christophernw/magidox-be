An oncoming X5 driver this morning was driving way too fast for the conditions forcing me to make use of my ABS.. If his vehicle wasn't about 1foot wider than most cars, even though he cut across the centre line, there would have been enough room to pass safely without needing to brake.. (I thought the main argument the drivers use is "they are safer"). . Carbon - generally an engine will only emit as much carbon as it takes in (as fuel).  We are already taxed on fuel, and this tax is directly proportional to the amount of fuel used.  . . The drivers of these low efficiency beasts understand how much fuel takes them from A-B, and that is part of their reason for buying such a vehicle in the first place (the I can afford it factor), it is proof that humans still have a childish retarded "insect-mind" attitude towards money and greed.

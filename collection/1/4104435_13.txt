well when you get pulled over sweet talk the cop and try and just get a warning if this does not work make sure you talk him into writing the tickets for around 6 miles over this will keep your points i get pulled over allot I manage to get warnings most of the time i just start talking and i must hold a record for the most warnings my son gets on to me but i love to drive and i have a sports car and its meant to be driven not just go from one place to the other if you know what i mean

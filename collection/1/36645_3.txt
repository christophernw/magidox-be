Had a lop for 9 years, and also a non-lop for 10 years.  The lop was definitely lazier, but still lived a long life.  If we let them out together, they would chase each other--so maybe consider getting another rabbit??  I think the secret to the longevity of our rabbits was for the most part only feeding them brown pellets, and occasionally fresh veggies.

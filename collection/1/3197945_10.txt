It's just the differences in cultures..........geez. . . The worst pronunciation of the English language I have ever heard is from the English. Especially with all the different dialects......and why do most all English people sound like the have a speech impediment. . Like a wad of crap in their mouth.. Or Jonathan Ross......Oh my God......what a freak! . . Go figure.

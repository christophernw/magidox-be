Political correctness has caused words to lose their meanings. What is an inner-city youth? Is it any young person who lives in an urban area, including the rich white kids in Manhattan, or does it mean poor black children in slums? If it means poor black children in slums, why don't they say so? Why are they called inner-city youth instead of poor black children in slums?. . What is an African-American? Egypt is in Africa, and so is the nation called South Africa. Is a white person, of Dutch descent, from South Africa, an African-American (but one of the lighter hue)? Is an Egyptian in America an African-American? If "African-American" means Negro, why don't they say so?

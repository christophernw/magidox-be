Even for a best mirror, the intensity of reflected light is only 75% of the incident intensity.. . In a prism, the light beam is incident normally on the face of the prism. For normal incidence the coefficient of reflection is less than 5%. That is almost, all the light passes through the prism. Further within the prism it is totally and normally reflected. Total normal reflection implies no light is refracted and all the light is reflected with out loss of intensity. The beam emerges normally out of the prism.. . Therefore, a prism is a more efficient than a mirror for reflection purposes.

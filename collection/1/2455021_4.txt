It's not wrong to plot points to graph the equation you gave, it's just unnecessary.  The equation is written in a form to give you the information you need to sketch it without plugging in points.  The parabola in question (assuming a<>0) has a vertex at (h,k).  If a>0, it opens upward; for a<0, downward.  The magnitude of a will determine how wide or narrow the parabola is; for instance a=3 or a=-3 will be narrower than a=1.

thats a good question. i would make them bigger. make sure they are easy to see-no bushes or trees in the way. have the ones with pictures with words too incase you cant remember the pictures. make sure the spray paint it cleaned off often. maybe have solar powerd lights to see them better. have minimum speed up as well as the speed limit. hmm i cant think of anything else rite now

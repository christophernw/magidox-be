Aside from suicide, what would you say are the legal limits of the rights to control one's body?  None..   To follow your thinking, if a fetus is not biologically part of the body, then it's a parasite.  Or are women just incubators?. .  No child should feel unwanted.  Granted.  So why force women to have an unwanted child?  And don't say adoption is an option for everyone.  People only want pretty, healthy, white babies.  . .  I agree we must take a stand against the conditions that lead to abortion, such as lack of REAL information about, and access to, contraceptives.   People are going to have sex.  Preaching abstinence is no solution; remember just say no to drugs?  . .   Abortion should be legal, safe, and rare.  The government should not be inserting itself into a decision that is private, and between a woman and her doctor.

If you have a car you should visit Casentino, a small valley about 30 km north from Arezzo. There are a lot of small town to visit: Bibbiena, Poppi , Stia. If you could stay more than one day you should visit La Verna with a beautiful monastery were S. Francesco lived, Camaldoli with his “eremo” and woods, a very special place for the nature. There are also some castles like Poppi and Romena (with an ancient romanic church).

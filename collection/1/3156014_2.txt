Marriage is a social and civil union between two people. It allows all kinds of privileges on Tax Returns and hospital visitation policies, etc. Civil Union recognizes the relationship and also allows for all the legal privileges of the marriage union, but does not recognize the social privileges that the marriage does. Same sex unions is a politically correct term that implies the union, but exposes the same sex aspect of those unions which involve such relationships. It is an effort to put under scrutiny the frequently socially unacceptable aspect of these relationships, and bears no real improvement over the other terms, except it does not need to use any further time explaining what union they are opposed to and therefore demonizes the participants in these relationships as those undeserving of legal or social protections.

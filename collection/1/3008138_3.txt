What exactly is your business about your sister's weight? The way you write about her here is so condescending that, if I were her, I would never listen to a word you say. That tone of contempt does not fire any confidence in her towards you.. . I'm sure there are many things that you're interested in that she doesn't give a fig-newton about. I don't want to jog with you, either - you sound like you're too competitive.

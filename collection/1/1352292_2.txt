Causes of Frequent Urination During Pregnancy. The bladder is a balloon-shaped muscle that stores urine. Muscles under the bladder keep the urethra (the tube where urine leaves your body) closed and keep urine from leaking out. . . The pressure of a full bladder signals your brain, giving you the “urge” to urinate. When you urinate, the muscles around the urethra relax and the bladder tightens to squeeze urine out. . . During pregnancy, the pressure of your growing uterus may cause your bladder to send the message that it’s full even when it’s almost empty. Your body also contains more fluid during pregnancy. Your kidneys work harder throughout your pregnancy to flush waste products out of your body. All of these changes make you need to urinate more often.. . As the uterus grows and rises higher during the second trimester, some women find that they don’t have to urinate as frequently as before. However, when the baby moves lower to prepare for delivery, the pressure increases, causing even more frequent urination. During this time, the pressure may wake you up several times each night to urinate. It may also force some urine to leak out, particularly if the muscles around the urethra are not very strong.  . . For the first few days after delivery, you may urinate even more often as your body gets rid of the extra fluid of pregnancy. But after a few days, your need to urinate should return to what it was before you became pregnant.

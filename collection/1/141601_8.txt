I know that this might sound very sad but I will explane.. Harry Potter.. I am 23 now and be for Harry Potter, I had nether been able to read a book.. I am Dislexic, and a few years ago now a friend of mine gave me a copy of the frist Harry Potter book, I took mw week to finsh it but when I did I was so happy with myself.. My partner that the time, Knowing that I had alway had trobul with my reading, went out and got me the rest of the books, and sat with me and helped me read the rest of them.. My reading have become a lot better, and I now read a new book with out anyhelp each mouth.. It could have been any book that done this, but It was Harry Potter.. It has helped me a load, and opend up a new world for me, I nolonger need people to help me read letter, and book.. . Just got to work on spelling now. Dispite being able to read the words, I am still not able to spell them all. Cant figger that one out.

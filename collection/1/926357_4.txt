Ok, so, I am not sure I can help much with the ejaculation since I am female...but.... . I have been taking Effexor for 2 years and I have had NO decrease in sex drive.   Actually, I was on Prozac before Effexor, and found that my sex drive went down.  On Effexor, I feel so much better.  . . Also, if you become nervous about potential side effects of Effexor, be careful about stopping the medication.  Effexor has some serious withdrawal symptoms.  I recently changed my dose from 150mg to 75mg a day and it took me one month to complete the change....and I still had some symptoms.  . . I think your best bet is to stick with the drug.  I think the benefits will greatly outweigh the side effects.  Also, I think that most of the side effects occur mostly at the start of treatment and decrease over time.  So, be patient, and good luck!

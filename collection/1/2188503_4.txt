I'm not sure what you mean by generic but almost every school will accept the transfer credits just check it out with that school. Otherwise if you wanted to get a job with that degree you'll need at least a masters. If you wanted to be a professor and pretty much have your own publisher you'll need a doctorate. I hope I helped, Good luck with whatever you're trying to to.

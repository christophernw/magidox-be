When did the Red Cross go into the building industry?  I must have missed that.  I thought their mission was to provide FIRST aid, which I think they did far more admirably than the government immediately after the Katrina crisis.  I hope you are never in an emergency situation, or if you are I hope no-one in the Red Cross saw you post this question, and decides to move on the the next needy person....

It sounds as if you are still a child. Once you grow up you might realise that that was not a way to behave. You might also realise that its not very smart to insult the people you want to convince with logic as they will imedietly have a negative disposition towards anything you say. . And might very well come to the conclusion that some dumb kid is hardly going to be the one with truly "logical" arguments.. . My advice: grow up, be nice to people like your religion told you to and live in harmony with everyone. . And to your cowardice point:. We atheists walk through life alone; we can't put trust into a supreme being watching over us. We are responsible for everything we do and have to handle everything on our own. There is no "Deo volente" to justify things outside our control, just our own inability. So don't call us cowards for choosing to bear our own cross. It is you who let someone else die for YOUR sins.. . . EDIT:. to anypurpose:. You do see the flaw in your logic don't you? I mean please tell me you are smarter than what you wrote there.. Because according to that reasoning I can say that George Bush doesn't exist since I only saw him on tv and never in the flesh, my neighbours parents don't exist since I havent met them... gosh how can someone call that logic or wonder why noone takes them and their belief serious.. And while we are at it. Religious beliefs are called that for a reason: you have to "believe" you can't prove. If it was otherwise you wouldnt be a believer. Words have meanings for a reason. Even if you might think otherwise.

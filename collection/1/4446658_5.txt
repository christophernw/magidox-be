Find the things you enjoy either separately or together and join some clubs - a bowling league, poker night, ballroom dancing, gourmet cooking classes - whatever you like. When you join these activities you will keep yourself occupied even if you don't make new friends, but meeting people that enjoy the same things as you do will no doubt end up in new friendships. :)

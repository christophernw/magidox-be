Sounds like a really strong bruise.  You may need more iron in your diet, but it's a good idea to check with your Dr. about it because you may have a condition that needs medical attention.  Another method that works well - especially for martial artists is a little Chineese concoction called "Dit Da Jow"  It's an herbal remedy, and it works in a flash!

You ask an excellent question.  In all of my years, I have never seen this question being raised so long past an election.  It just goes to show how our leadership has not  been effective in uniting this great country.  Without getting into the emotional, name calling, I feel that we can prevent another election from being stolen, by energizing a larger voter turn out.  Granted, the Republicans have been more effective in energizing groups that have generally been dismissed in the past--and by giving them greater "voice", they stand a chance of having the more "extreme" voice heard for some time.

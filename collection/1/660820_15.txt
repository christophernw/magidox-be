i think you should buy (or get from your closet) an item of clothing that is a little bit too small and then hang it up somewhere where you will see it more than once a day.  When you see this you wil want to slim down and fit in it so you will do your exercise and eat healthier.  Also you can pledge to exercise with a friend so you both will do your exercising and you won't have to do it alone.  Statistics proove that if you make a commitment to somebody else that both of you are more likely to actually exercise.  Good Luck

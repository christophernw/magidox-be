Zara is my favorite cothing store. It was first opened in 1975 in A Coruna (Spain).During the last couple year this chain witnessed an enormous growth and is present in over 47 countries all over the world. They carry elegant, trendy cloths. Their quality is great for comparebly little money.I wish they would open a couple stores in the midwest.

An injective function is a function which associates distinct arguments to distinct values. More precisely, a function f is said to be injective if, for every y in the codomain, there is at most one x in the domain such that f(x) = y.. . Put another way, f is injective if f(a) = f(b) implies a = b (or a ≠ b implies f(a) ≠ f(b)), for any a, b in the domain.. . Examples :. . 1. The function f : R → R defined by f(x) = 2x + 1 is injective. . 2. The function g : R → R defined by g(x) = x^2 is not injective, because (for example) g(1) = 1 = g(−1). . . I hope, now you are clear with it.. . All the best.

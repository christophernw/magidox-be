Hi my hubby was an immigrant from another country now he already had a permanent visa and could work without any trouble. So when he married me it didnt' change anything. I believe that if you do get married to a citizen one should be able to apply for a permanent visa and the ability to work. However i strongly recommend that you get a good lawyer who works in Immigration law. It is a long process and their are often twists and turns. You really need someone to back you up who know what they are doing. Good luck! When you get a piece of paper in the mail that says you are going to be a citizen its a wonderful feeling. I was jumping up and down for my hubby while crying. The ceremony was in Boston and it was so touching all these people from all over the world here in America for that dream we all have. Good luck and i mean that from the bottom of my heart. God Bless you.

Puberty is the period during adolescence when sexual maturity takes place.  In girls, the breasts develop, the hips widen, and they begin to have periods.  In males, the voice deepens, they grow chest and facial hair, and in both sexes genital hair grows.   Once all that happens, puberty is over and you pass into the stage called "adulthood".

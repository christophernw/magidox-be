because some of the men dont like to go through any trouble they just seek a comfortable life they marry to depend on some one else even when they are wrong as they afraid of the punishment they run from the punishment ofcourse every one doesnt like to be punishment so women are not exception but the problem is men are more proud than women so its hard for them to accept their mistake or to be punishment even when they know they are wrong so they hide themselve behind their women

You will probably find that both offer a similar range of subjects, but 6th form tends to be the "safer" option. You're with a lot of the people you've been with right through school and you'll find that you might have a lot of the same teachers you had through school. They say that they'll treat you like adults but it doesn't feel that way at all.. . College is the opposite of that. You're treated as an adult, you will meet with a wide range of new people of all ages (6th form is restricted to just your age group). I think that you learn a lot more about life from going to college. Another noticeable difference is that you tend to call the lecturers by their first names rather than just Mr / Mrs x.. . I'd choose college any day.

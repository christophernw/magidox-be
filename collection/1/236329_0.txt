Get a "Privacy Block" on your phone so that the phone will not ring unless the person states who they are.  The phone will then ring -- you can pick up and hear who is calling-- then decide to answer.  If you do not answer, they simply get the message, "This number did not pick up the phone, call again later," or something to this extent.. . They do not know that you picked up the phone, heard who, and then hung up.

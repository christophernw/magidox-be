I hope someday happens. I think the US government should see both sides of the problem with illegal immigration and then decide what to do.. . I really have faith that the problem will someday be solve, soon or later it will be solved. I am just scared, because if it takes long time for this to happen, I am scared that a civil war will end this up. If is not a civil war, then it will be something worst.. . I hope both sides understand the problem, but I am sure that people, immigrants, will let the government know that they don't like what they are doing. . . Mexico will never and should never become a state of the U.S., not because as "MissR" says, but because Mexico fought its own independence and Mexico is a very strong and happe family.. . I don't agree with MissR because you are actually stereotyping, I know people from Mexico can be like that, but it is not just from Mexico, even here in the U.S. there are so many criminals and bad traditions, so please don't just point the finger to one country. Continuing, Mexico would fight for its independence again, and all its people will stand up for it. Like what Father Miguel Hidalgo did with all peasants.. . Mexicans also have education, and it is not 90% of Mexicans that don't have an education, there are many more, I just think MissR doesn't know how to get prcentages. There is a total of 89% of Mexicans citizens of Mexico that have finished a Higher education (University).. . Get it?

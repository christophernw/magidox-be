black friday is the day after thanksgiving (4th thursday in november) when the retail stores have insane sales and people literally line up at the door hours before the store opens and the store opens earlier than usual. this is the one time a year that retail stores actually bring in a profit the rest of the year they are in the "red" so to speak and black friday brings them into the "black" so to speak. I'm loathing black friday because I work at target and am going to have to deal with all this crapola.

It seems likely to me that the powerful Jewish leaders feared Jesus; they say him as a threat to their authority and worried he would create an uprising against their Roman rulers.  They wanted Jesus crucified purely out of self-interest, which seems consistent with their behavior and certainly not lost on someone as gifted in human insight as Jesus was.

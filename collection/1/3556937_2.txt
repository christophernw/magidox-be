Lava is molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. Magma is molten rock below the earth's surface. Lava, when first exuded from a volcanic vent, is a liquid at temperatures from 700 째C to 1,200 째C (1,300 째F to 2,200 째F). Although lava is quite viscous, about 100,000 times the viscosity of water, it can flow great distances before cooling and solidifying.

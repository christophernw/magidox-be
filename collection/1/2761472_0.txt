You can't make your wrists larger...your wrist consists of two bones, very minimal fat padding, and flexor and extensor tendons for your hand and fingers. You can do all the hand grip/wrist curl exercises in the world, but your wrists aren't gong to get any larger...your forearms will, but not your wrist.. . Incase you don't believe me...there is a formula used to calculate total body fat that, among other values, measures waist circumference and then subtracts wrist circumference. The idea behind this is that your wrist will represent the BONES in your body and not the muscle or fat.

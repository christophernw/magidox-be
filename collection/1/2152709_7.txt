Heath bits, nuts, M&Ms, butterscotch, white choclate chips, peanut butter chips, rasins.. . My favorite recipe is make peanut butter cookies and when there almost done take them out and put in a hershey kiss on the middle of them. Put them back in for a minute or 2 and take them out and sprinkle a little sugar on them.

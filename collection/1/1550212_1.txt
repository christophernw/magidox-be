our lungs are covered by a double layerd sac..called the pleura. the two layers are called visecral and parietal.. normally there is very little fluid in the pleura...to overcome friction..etc... if there is accumulation of fluid, above normal...then it is called pleural effusion.. it can be due to many causes...eg...inflammation, tuberculosis, malignancy...etc...

Sounds to me like you are just out to make a fast buck...If you knew what you were doing in the first place you would'nt be on here asking about free web sites.As a breeder myself I can tell you that if you take care of the dogs and puppies properly you wont be making a lot of money.I've been breeding for awhile now and have not made one red cent.Any money goes right back into my dogs.And yes all buyers are screened before a sale and I am willing to take any of my puppies back so they dont end up in shelters....Are you willing to do that??????We have enough wanna be breeders now that dont do their homework and dont have a clue how to be a good breeder....Give it up!!!!We HAVE ENOUGH UNWANTED ANIMALS NOW BECAUSE OF BREEDERS LIKE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!

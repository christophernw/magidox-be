You can say all you like about bad breath but trying to get someone to do something about it is entirely different. My partner is the sweetest person in the world but is terrified of dentists. Their breath is so bad it gets to embarrassment point but they are not aware of it! If you can persuade them to go to the dentist then I'm sure you can find the problem. If you are concerned with someone like myself then I can only wish you good luck - an appointment with the dentist is the best solution.

It has to do with our relationship with Jesus and with our faith....the following passage explains what I mean..... . 6"Be careful," Jesus said to them. "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees." . 7They discussed this among themselves and said, "It is because we didn’t bring any bread." . 8Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, "You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? . 9Do you still not understand? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? . 10Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? . 11How is it you don’t understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees." . 12Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

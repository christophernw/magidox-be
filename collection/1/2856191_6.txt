a.) What limits are you speaking of, exactly?  I understand that freedom of speech comes with the responsibility not to yell "FIRE!" in a crowded theatre, but in order to address this, you must be more specific about the limits that are to be imposed on a woman's rights over her very own body.. b.) Biologically, a leech is not part of your body.  Does that mean that a person does not have the right to remove a leech from their body?. . a.) I agree.  So why bring such a child into the world in the first place?  A heartless point, but a valid one.. b.) I have no objection.  However, you are still asking to hijack a woman's body and life for 9 months so that the result can benefit others.  While it would be a good and virtuous thing to do, it is not for us to demand that a woman do it.. . a.) I agree, we have a lot to fight against.  Ignorance, underuse of contraception, unsupportive relationships.  Abortion really ought to be a last-resort.  But it ought to be an _available_ last resort.. b.) Let's fight these together!. . In any case, when science is allowed to progress to a point when we can transfer a fetus from one mother to another safely, then we can worry about saving the lives of the unborn children.  For now, we cannot justify compromising essential liberties to secure a little temporary safety for a small number of individuals.

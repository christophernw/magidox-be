I just bought some today and on the receipt it reads, "yam/sweet potato". According to Wikipedia, "In the United States, sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas) are often referred to as "yams". Sweet potatoes labeled (incorrectly, according to some) as "yams" are widely available in U.S. grocery stores. True yams are mostly only found in specialty markets such as those that serve Asian or Caribbean communities."

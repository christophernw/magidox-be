Tell her that you are no longer in love with her. For love to work, it must be a two way affair and not one-sided. Plianly let her understand that love cannot be forced on sonmebody and that there is no way she can get the best from you. Then you must stop having sex with her or engaging in any intimate activity to drive home your point. Best of luck.

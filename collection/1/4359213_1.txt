You should contact the appropriate Vietnam government department that issued the passport. The same department will issue a new passport. They may require that the old passport be returned in order to get a renewed passport. When I needed to renew my passport while living in China, I had to send my old passport by FedEx to a friend in the U.S. who then sent it by standard post to the State Department. They would not accept any overseas mail or delivery of passport. It had to be mailed from inside the U.S. You may or may not face the same requirements because it depends on the Vietnam government, not the U.S. government.. . In any case, seek the advice of the U.S. Bureau of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) concerning staying in the U.S. while your passport travels to and from Vietnam.

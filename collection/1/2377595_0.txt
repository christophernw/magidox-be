There is always a magnetic field around any conductor carrying magnetic field whether it is dc or ac.. . In the case of steady current the magnetic field is also steady; do not change. When the circuit is closed or opened the magnetic field changes and induces  a current opposing the  change. That is why sparks are produced in the switches when opening or closing the circuit.. . In ac the current is continuously changing and the magnetic field is also continuously changing and send em wave.. . Special filter circuits are added in radio communication to avoid the  interference due to this ac current.

Well when you wake up in the morning(hoping that you have brushed your teeth the night before), rinse your mouth with water. After that have breakfast. Then go ahead to brush your teeth with a flouride tooth paste and a good toothbrush. Go through your day smoothly after everything. Always wash your mouth with clean fresh water and take minty toffee after every meal.Use toothpick to carefully remove any meat particles inbetween your teeth.  Do not keep your mouth shut for a long time. This can create bad breathe. So even if you are idle, try to sing for the fresh air outside to replace the bad one inside. With this you will have fresh breathes always.

Articles of Incorporation, and other corporate documents are a matter of public record.  First you must determine in which state the company is incorporated.  You can look up companies on the various state websites. If you don't know where they are incorporated, try Delaware, Nevada, California, and Florida first. They are the more common states. If you still can't find the company, contact a corporate service company such as CRS (listed below) who can provide you with that information.  Once you are able to determine the State, you can lookup the corporate information required to order such documents.  There is often a time difference in mail orders vs. service company orders, so check with a service company to estimate cost and turnaround time.  A good place to start researching is Registered Agent Solutions's website (www.rasi.com).  They have a link library to all 50 states.

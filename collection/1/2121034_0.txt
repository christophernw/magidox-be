Pilots are used for their local knowledge of the port and ship handling ability.  The ships captain can probably bring the vessel into the port but it is usually safer to have a pilot do it who has that local knowledge of the waters and dangers associated.  The captain still has ultimate responsibility and can relieve the pilot from command at any time he sees fit.

it's recommended that you use tylenol only for an infant, because it's easier on their little tummies.. Use ibuprofen/motrin only on fevers that won't reduce with tylenol alone.. Children are more likely to develop allergic reactions to ibuprofen too, so watch your infant closely after giving it to him/her.. But, if you infant has a fever of 102 and over, and it keeps returning, especially after treatment, get your baby to the nearest doctor.  It very well could be something more serious.

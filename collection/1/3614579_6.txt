It has gone beyond being driven mad and you have obviously actually become mad. . Your cat wants to come in because it needs shelter and knows that being outside all the time is unhealthy!. Let the poor creature inside and install a cat flap so that she can come and go at will. My cat is in all night and doesn't go toilet - you you may find you don't need cat flap or litter tray and she'll wait for you to let her out.

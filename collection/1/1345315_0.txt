I seriously doubt it.  Even sodium pentathol, the "truth serum" you hear about in movies, isn't really a  truth drug.  It has the effect of putting someone in a highly suggestible, semi-conscious drugged state that can be useful in getting them to tell you what you want, but if it were truly a truth serum, it would make extracting information a whole lot easier than torture.. . Of course if your friend is Harry Potter, and he uses veritas serum, that's different.

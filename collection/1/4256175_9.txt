You might not believe this, but when my grandmother had this problem, and her doctor prescribed Crisco shortening.  He actually wrote a prescription for it and the pharmacy sent it to her and billed Medicare.  She put it on her feet at night regularly for several weeks and it made a huge difference.. . I'm serious....not kidding.

I do not agree with everything you said...but I did the google thing anyway. That really s__ks. There are a lot of differences in the VIETNAM war and the one in Iraq. I find that I have plenty of personal freedom...much more than people in  most other countries. I voted for Bush AND i still support him...however, he HAS to do MORE about this illegal immigration!

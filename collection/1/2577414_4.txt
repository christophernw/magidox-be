"It hurts" has given you the most accurate answer, a parish is what's used for a priest to live in, usually a little abode at the side of a church.  I've been a Christian all of 35 years (my entire life) so, thats how i know.  somebody above confused "parish" with "perish"...the latter means, to die, usually in a bad way, or when something is ruined, it perishes.  a PARISH though, is as outlined above.

I don't think I've ever heard the words "Bless God" in that order. The cliche goes "God bless (insert Noun here)". Implying Americans have the audacity to TELL GOD what to bless.. WHY they do this?  Because unless they're clergy, they don't think they can bless anything, they have to tell God to do it..   From observation, I would say that they want things blessed so they'll stick around, like blessing is the same as wishing longevity on it.  You don't hear "God bless dog poop" or "God bless poison oak." Safe to assume if they ask God to bless something they want it to stick around for awhile. . . And, unfortunately, a solid portion of Americans consider themselves Christians, which is why they don't bless anything themselves, and they use the word "God" instead of some other name for a higher power.

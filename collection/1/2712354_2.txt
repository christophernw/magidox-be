if she's AKC registered, then you can get it from the resgistration.  . if they lied about her AKC registration (that's what it sounds like in your question) then good luck.  . really there's no way to track it without the breeder's help or the AKC.. . at least none that i know of.  congrats on your new BIG friend!!!!

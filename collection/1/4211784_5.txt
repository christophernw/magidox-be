lol...you remind me of my children...I don't know how old you are, but...no one person can tell you what to be...or what not to be...you and only you can answer that question...and only time will determine that...your experences in life will mold you into the person you'll be when your older...if this question lays heavy upon your mind and heart...then I say for you to pray a prayer to God...and ask him for forgiveness of all your sins...and then to open up your mind and heart...to the direction that he wants you to go in...and ask him to place Guardian Angels around you on your journey through life...to help guide you the way that he wants you to go in this life...and pray for his protection...to be with you at all times...in your lifes journey...and may you always follow Gods directions and you'll never go wrong in life...believe me...God does answer prayers...and he's always with you...always remember...when one door shuts...God will open another door for you...

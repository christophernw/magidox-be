Why don't you tell the landlord the truth? You are having a hard way to go right now and you just went back to work and you might could give him money when you get paid. Voiding him is a bad thing. Once you lie you have to keep lieing about what ever better off to just tell the truth. Telling the truth will get you futher than a lie will GOOD LUCK

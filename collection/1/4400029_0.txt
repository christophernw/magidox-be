I would ask her why she has discontinued writing fiction when she is evidently so good at it.  I would also ask her why she chooses to stay in India, where she is unpopular and where she has run into problems with the law. Finally, I'd ask her what she thinks the greatest challenges facing the global community are, and what needs to be done to ease the poverty and suffering in the Third World. These are questions that are particular to Roy's situation, and her responses to them would give great insight into her character, ideals and values.

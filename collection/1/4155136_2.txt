Its a comic book, a very old comic book for children.. . it was a old term for a noisy festive celebration. It was slang for a bean feast, an annual celebration which included a meal of beans and bacon.. The first parties were wazgoose parties held by printers, but in.  the 18th century when landowners started providing an annual feast for their farm labourers and families. The celebrations, with much cider drinking and dancing, lasted all day. The centrepiece was a hearty meal of beans and bacon. Apart from Sundays, it was the only paid holiday that the labourers had, so it was the highlight of their year and became known as a beanfeast. . . Later, the mill and factory owners of northern England adopted the same benevolent streak! This time they sent their workers on a day trip to the seaside. The bosses rented trains or convoys of charabancs (an early open-top motor coach) to take the whole workforce to resorts such as Blackpool, Skegness, and Scarborough. Enormous quantities of beer and sandwiches were also provided, and there was much frolicking, singing and drunkenness. The bosses discovered that paying for a day at the seaside for their workers, away from the dust and noise of the factory, was a worthwhile investment. It gave their workers something to look forward to and some fresh air for their lungs. It was a big event in the workers' lives. This was probably the only holiday they were likely to get, so it is only natural that they looked forward to the works' outing, or beano as it became known.

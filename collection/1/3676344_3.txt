It has partly do with the media.. . Let's not forget about terrorism in Northern Ireland between Catholics and Protestants; The Basque in France and Spain; Hindus killing Moslems in Bombay; . . You are right that a terrorist can be a follower of any religion, but let's flip this for a second and I preface this before I state this that I neither condone/endorse terrorism:. . A terrorist may be an evil heinous person to one group of people in society but he also may be a martyr, hero and an individual fighting for a cause he or she may believe is the only thing to get any attention from the world.  Case in point is Palestine.. . Moslems do condemn the terrorism. Read the editorials and letters to the editors from newspapers other than the west. The world needs to step back and look at this:. . "hmmm, I wonder why is it that only moslems are 99 percent of the terrorists." If this percentage is true, questions should be discussed at the foreign policy level: why do they hate us, what can we do to solve this problem, did we do something wrong in the past that is coming back to haunt us.. . Don't post ignorant and bigoted comments.. . Good discussion. Keep it rolling!

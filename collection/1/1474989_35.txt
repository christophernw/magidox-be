I think you're asking the wrong question.  I believe in God, a greater power.  I don't believe in Satan, despite the many people who've answered you that seem to.  People don't like to take responsibility for the bad things in the world or the choices they make.  I do believe that we all have lessons to learn in this life and without getting into too much detail on my beliefs, it was her time to go.  I know that isn't going to make you feel any better but if you truly believe that we all have a soul/spirit, this spirit knows far more than our conscious mind does.  You see this as a great injustice because you don't understand it and you're the one left behind.  If you believe in God, you must also believe that there is more after death.  She's in a better place.  If you believe in many lives, you will meet her again at some point.  . . Whatever you believe, I hope you find your way through this.  If we understood God, we wouldn't need to be placed on this earth.  Close your eyes and picture a happy memory of your friend and keep that with you.  I'm sure she's wishing you peace.

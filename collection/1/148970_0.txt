We do not drink alcohol because we are not supposed to do anything to damage or disrespect our bodies, which are creations of and gifts of God. We do not drink, smoke, take drugs, and are counseled not to do body piercings or tattoos. However, the choice is always our own to make.. . A lot of people besides Mormons don't drink because it's bad for you, it's expensive, damages fetuses, changes personalities,  makes you lose control of yourself, causes headaches, and many people die in alcohol-related accidents. It's SMART not to drink no matter what religion you are.

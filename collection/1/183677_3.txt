Zionism is the belief that the Jewish people are historically tied to the land of Judea and the surrounding area.  The Romans renamed it Palestine after the Diaspora in AD 63 to discourage the return of Jews.  Many non-Jews, myself included, believe that the Jewish people have a right to this land and that the "Palestinians" are the actual interlopers.  The state of Israel is often referred to as the "Zionist Occupation" by Arab press because they cannot recognize Israel as a legitimate country.

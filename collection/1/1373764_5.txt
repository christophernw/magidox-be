It will be fine for a while if it was healthy to begin with.. . The problem is that turtles are surprisingly good at hiding, and masters at staying put.. . Get on your stomach as close as you can to where it probably hit the ground and start looking for dark hiding spaces- under furniture, in piles of clothes, in bags or sacks, etc. Clean up or block as many options as you can as you go.. . It probably did not get far, and is probably a lot closer than you think!

Ask questions and find out what the person likes, then learn about the subject so you can talk intelligently.  Think how the other person feels, not about yourself. Smile and say things that will put the other person at ease.  They will think you are a wonderful conversationalist, unless they are too insecure.  It gets easier with practice.

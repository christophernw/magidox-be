A nun covers up as a personal choice.  Many Muslim women don't have a choice.  It isn't the covering up that is objectionable.  It's the requirement to do it.  Yes, I realize not all Muslim woman are forced to it.. . I don't know anybody who calls Muslims extremists just because they have a beard.  . . Christians and Muslims are not close theologically.  There is an irreconcilable difference between our understandings of Jesus and His purpose.  We both pray to the one God, so I guess we are brothers in that respect.. . Christians believe in Muhammad too.  They just don't believe he was a prophet.

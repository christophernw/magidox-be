because air contains water and generally warm air contains more water so as the air is cooled by the refrigeation unit inside the airconditioner a bit of water/condensation develops in the box and it drains away onto the floor.. The principle is similar when you put cold coke in a glass and let it sit on the bench some condensation comes on the outside of the glass on its own.

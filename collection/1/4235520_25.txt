Gnostic comes from the Greek word 'Gnosis' that means knowledge.  The Gnostics were a sect in the Jesus Movement of the New Testament times that did not believe Jesus had a body at all.  They believed in a special, secret knowledge from Jesus to them.  They thought that everything in the material world, including one's own body, is evil.  Gnostics believed that the body that Jesus had on earth was simply a facade.  It wasn't real.  It's more of an illusion actually.  There are gospels that are named the Gnostic gospels such as the Gospel of Thomas and others, but it is highly debateable if all of them are really gospels written by Gnostics.  . .

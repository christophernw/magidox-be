my dogs only bark when there is an animal that it does not like.. we have raccoons in our yard.. or when they walk by a strange smelling person.. or when they want attention.. they probably bark because they want to be with you.. or they are afraid of the dark which i doubt.. or it is a werewolf and barking at the moon!

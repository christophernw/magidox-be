I am an American. I see that In other countries they ride bikes and walk everywhere. In Italy, I hear everyone rides bikes! I mean people can't even walk a little they have to drive and spend money on gas. Also there are some lazy people. I agree I think Americans should be much more healthy! Also eveyrone goes to Mcdonalds. And I hear that portions are smaller in other countries.

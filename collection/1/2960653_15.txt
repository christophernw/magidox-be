There is such a thing as a liberal christian...hmm...sorry we take everyone into consideration....not everyone celebrates christmas...what about Jewish people?. . I personally love christmas....Not everyone believes in it. and no it's not a discrimination of christian rights....do you not think it's discriminating to have everyone assume everyone is a christain?

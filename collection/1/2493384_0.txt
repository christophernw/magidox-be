First of all, rebreathing into a paper bag is no longer the recommended treatment for hyperventilation, as CO2 levels can rise too quickly or can exacerbate a larger problem.. . There are many causes for hyperventilation--lack of O2 is just one of them.. . Rebreathing exhaled air increases the CO2 in your lungs which prompts you to breathe deeply rather than quick shallow breaths. You are using one of your body's many feedback control systems to return to normal breathing patterns.

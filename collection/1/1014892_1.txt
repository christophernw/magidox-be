A lease is a legally binding document. Leasing an apartment means that you intend to live there for X amount of time (usually they are about 12 months long). It will be hard to move out of there before your lease is up, unless there is certain clauses in your contract. . . Renting, is usually on a month to month basis where there is no set time on the contract.

Prostitution in Nevada, is legal only in certain areas.  The simple street walker isn't legal.  As evidence on COPS... Our country was founded by puritans, some of those same isms. for lack of a better term, still stand to this day.  Where as countries like Canada, and a slew of others, do allow prostitution, it's much differant than what we have here.  There are strict guidelines that they must follow, regarding health check ups and what not.  The question of taxing the girls services... Service charge...(lol)  wouldn't amount to a lot.  It's really not going to change anything really.

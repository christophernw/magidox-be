If you like cute and little, I'd say either a Jack Russel, or a Pomeranian. If you want smallish, a Min Pin, or maybe a whippet. Papillions are also very cute. Just make sure you have the time and money for any grooming, exercising, and vet check-ups. Also consider checking your local shelter for a good companian. Save lives.

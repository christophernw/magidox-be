What you describe, my god brings back memories; I was exactly like you. Being defensive not letting anyone get close, family and boyfriends. It kind of ruined my relationships, and I've become a angry gay guy, guys at work avoid me cuz they dont dare say any queer slangs at me. Its something you have to open up and relax and be yrself, be comfortable being yrself. Its hard but dont think bout what others think of you, love them or leave them.

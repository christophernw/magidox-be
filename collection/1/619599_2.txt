Take him or her to the vet. Is there a black discharge in his ears? Dogs who are allergic to their food can have a black, foul smelling discharge from their ears which is indicative of a yeast infection. Weekly baths are far too much! Dogs have natural oils on their skin and by bathing too often you will create skin problems. Make sure you use dog shampoo (not human or baby shampoo) bc the shampoo should have no alcohol at all. That smell is probably due to infection. If so, your Vet will recommend a special ear wash and also antibiotics. Step one: See the Vet. And make sure you ask her/him about how often you should be bathing your pet. If that is a yeast infection, you will have to  start thinking about trying different foods. Anyway - start with a Vet. Good luck. This may take a while; so be patient!

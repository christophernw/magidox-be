Eyes are just one part of the whole body that are influenced by family genetics, if your mum has black hair and brown eyes and your dad has blue eyes and blonde hair you are more likely to have dark hair and dark eyes, this is because the dark colours are the dominate ones. sometimes though you can have a throw back to grandparents where both your mums and dads parents had red hair and blue eyes or blonde hair and blue eyes and your mum was the only one with the dark hair and brown eyes you can get hazel eyes ( bluey green eyes) and brown or red hair. In very rare cases you can get a blond hair blue eyed dark skinned child from 2 fair parents and also a child with a hazel eye and a brown eye or blue eye and hazel eye, This is all to do with genetics - what makes us up as a person as influenced by our family background.

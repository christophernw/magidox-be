Seriously, there are so many good Television sets available in the market for you to choose. There are so many brands and each brand has variety of models. . . Which to buy depends upon the buyer. What do you want. If you want High Defination TV's - It will be more expensive. Since, money isnt a matter for you. Then you should just check the specifications you want. Then, simply select the best look you find. All TV's will normally give you the same performance. You can also tell the staff/promoter what purpose you want the TV for and he will show you varieties to choose from. Again, just select the one that looks nice.. . You should also read reviews about TV Models before buying them. Just write the model name in google and you can read Review's from people who have bought it.. . Try SONY Wega.

I don't know... he has good intentions but he is just messing up waaaay too much.. . I think that we (the Republican juggernaut) will fall thanks to him. I see this happening within the next 4 years. Well... we had a good run, with 12 years of having control over the house and all. I just hope the democrats don't mess it up even more...

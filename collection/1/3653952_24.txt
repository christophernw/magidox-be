I get scared sometimes as a white person, The confederate flag as a symbol was created to symbolize the fact that the south wanted to segregate itself from the USA.  Not that I think that you need to be a patriotic nut job and not be proud of your roots, but if the government wants to look for groups of people who are most likely to try to overthrow our government, wouldn't it be the people who after so many years still carry there symbol and wave their symbol of resentment towards the United states.  I bet these same people have a problem with immigration, but they are ok waving their anti-patriotic flags around.  It is a scary thought.

clostridium difficile is a bacteria which in normal patients doesnt affect the bowel, but in someone who is already taking lots of antibiotics this bacteria can cause profuse diarrhoea, it is treated with antibiotics but a sample is taken to see what antibiotic it is sensitive to. it is very treatable.

Today there is soo much clutter, and its getting harder and harder to break through it (as an advertiser). Basically you need to target your advertistement so it stands out to the people who you want to be your audience - i.e. grab their attention.. . Notice how posters of good looking scantily clad women attracts male attention ;)

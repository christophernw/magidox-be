If you use a Q-tip, use it carefully.. . One method is to tip your head so the affected ear is downward then gently pull the top of your ear upwards and wiggle it back and forth.  Also try pulling the lobe downward and wiggle it.  This will sometimes break the air pocket that is holding the water in your ear.. . There are also drops you can buy at the pharmacy to help in this.

n times 0 will always equal 0 because anything times 0 is zero.its just the way the rules work in math.because can n go into 0 if theres nothin to go into it.NO. so that is why it is zero.for an example 1 times 0 equals 0 because 1 cant go into 0 because theres nothin to go into .1 is bigger than 0 but zero is a digit that means nothing.so thats why.i hope i helped

Your dog in heat means she can easily get pregnant and have a bundle of little puppies.  Keep her inside, only put her out when she has to go to the bathroom, but stand close by and make sure no other dogs come near her.  . . A male dog can smell a female dog in heat - miles away - and they will come to pay her a visit if your not careful.. . When she out of heat, get her to the vets office and get her spayed / fixed so that you won't have to worry about your little one getting pregnant.

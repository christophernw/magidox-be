Yahoo has an age restriction and your parents permission was required to sign up. The idea is that your usage would be monitored by your parents. ALL of your postings should only appear in the Teen and Preteens section. And, you really shouldn't even be reading any of the other sections.. You need to be grateful that yahoo even allows 13 year olds to participate. It is like a gift. Respect it.

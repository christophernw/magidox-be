If you place moth balls in your flower beds temporarily it will train the dog not to use this spot for his dirty deed. (Works for cats as well) As for the smell you will need to dig up part of the earth where the odor is worse. Replace it and add in 3 tablespoons of baking soda.  Make sure your plants aren't "Acid Lovers" prior to this application.

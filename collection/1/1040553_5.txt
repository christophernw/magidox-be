I agree with you, I don't get it either.  But I do want to say something to the people responding with "golly, it's all proof cuz it's so complex" and similar answers.. . The beauty we see around us is only beautiful to us because we've adapted to the environment we live in.  If we were brain gobblers from Mars we'd find the sky, the earth, and the trees to be darn scary and forboding, not to mention too hot.. . Also, consider this:  Why does God creating the universe preclude the notion that God uses evolution as a tool?   There is also this:  Who said God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day?  Somebody wrote that, did God bend that persons ear and say "psst, hey buddy, I made all this in six days"  As for those people who believe the Earth is only 6000 years old, how do you have proof that it's any older than you yourself are?

You can't.  Once you got 'em, you got 'em. . What about the guy back in the seventies who was working as a parking lot man in San Diego, and he was supporting his family on minimum wage and the union was taking twelve dollars out of every paycheck.. That's cause miminum wage caught up with union demands, and he was paying dues to help out the poor union officials, and that was good of him to do that.  I don't wanna say which cause I don't, but I guess some unions are better than others.  And what's the best one good for?. . If you got a union, you got one.  If you got a rash, you got one. I could make up a whole list of things, if you got it, you got one.  And it's the "Lord Have Mercy" list.

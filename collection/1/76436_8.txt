It's mainly ingnorance.. For some odd reason black manhood tends to be justified by how many sexual conquests one has. It also doesn't help that many black women are scared that will lose a black man if they don't have sex with him.. As a result unprotected sex runs wild in the black community. All these black women are getting it from someone.. And many still think they can't get AIDS and look at Magic Johnson as proof that AIDS can't kill them. Despite the fact that he has it and still looks healthy.

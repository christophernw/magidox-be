Why would you want to? Spreading lies and disinformation isn't something to do at a young age. If you are really determined, buy a direct translation tanakh, and carry THAT to school.  I promise it will get more conversation.. More importantly, a tanakh is the Bible before evil satanists stole the bible to have it mistranslated on purpose.. . The Gospels of Thomas, Judas, Mary Magdelene, And Mary, Mother of Jesus, are all much better Reads than the ones that got included in the Bible, by the way.

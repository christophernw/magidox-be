Automotive airbrushers are out there, to be sure...but in your area? I really don't know.  I guess the first thing I'd look for is there a store where you are, or near there that caters more towards airbrush artists (rather than just artists in general, or people who do crafty type stuff)...I'd talk to them...see who they know.. Possibly advertise in an airbrush magazine that you get there?

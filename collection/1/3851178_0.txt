I don't know for sure, but I would think it might have something to do with an ability on their part to sense a change in the barometric pressure. I know there are dogs who can sense when there owner is about to have a seizure and can get them to sit or go to the floor before they fall and hurt themselves, so I DO know they know stuff WE don't!! That's an interesting question. I'll stay posted to this one and keep up with the answers.

If you are referring to god with a capital G then I'll tell you why. People don't have to believe in God, it's a matter of choice. However, if you choose to believe in God, then your life will be different because you he is the supreme being, who can do the impossible. He is the only one who can change an impossible situation around. When you get to know him better, then you'll begin to appreciate his awesomeness

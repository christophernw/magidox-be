My wife can cook better curry than the takeaways & she uses ghee instead of oil & fresh chillies & spices. She combines all the ingredients & cooks them to make the sauce, then she blends them up in a blender to give an even consistency. She adds all different things into the blender aswell such as whole tomatoes etc.. Once the sauce is made she adds the meat or fish & simmers it to give an authentic curry.

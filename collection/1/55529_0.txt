If you rinse the buret with distilled water, when you add the NaOH to it, there may still be water left in the buret, thus, diluting the concentration of the NaOH solution.  This would give you a lower molarity of NaOH than if you rinsed the buret with NaOH solution because mixing NaOH with NaOH (if they are both identical in concentration) would not change the concentration.

I know it sounds silly (and somewhat gross), but this was the recommendation I received from my grandmother, who is an artist and was an art teacher. If you're using fine brushes, after *thoroughly* washing and cleaning the brush, put it briefly in your mouth to moisten it with your saliva, and make sure it's in the right shape. The bristles will stiffen as they dry, but will soften as soon as you work the brush.. . (Be careful, though, as some paints and cleansers are toxic!!)

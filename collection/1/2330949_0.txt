You need a 14 volt adapter.  I will tell you why.  Your car runs 14 volts when it is running and this is what the cd player runs while in the car.  I will tell you from experience that a 12 will not work on some stereos it doesnt push enough power.  If you have an old cordless drill or phone with a powerpack just cut then end off and hook it up to your stereo.  Make sure you connect both power wires to the hot wire and the ground to the other wire.  Goodluck.

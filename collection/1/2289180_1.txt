Obviously the dog is for protection and the cat is there to judge the Catfights, Yes? . Don't sweat it, tell your kid to take a chill pill. And if that doesn't work, she can walk the dog (making him a "service dog momentarily) and have the cat mercilessly tease the next door neighbors dog. I call that entertaining a client, and I deduct it everytime!

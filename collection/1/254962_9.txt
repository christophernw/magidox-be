Overdrive is an oversized gear that causes the engine to operate at a low rpm and its so large usually that even cars with alot of torque have trouble accelerating quickly in this gear. Never pull anything in this gear as your motor will be under way to much strain. It causes the motor to have a larger bind on the crank shaft, and it requires more force and a bigger explostion from the cylinders to move it. Ive seen a moron which will remain nameless ;) "they know who they are" j/k blow a head gasket and almost blew up more,... they didnt even realize that when the motor pings from detonation... its bad.. . Supposedly... the overdrive gear is so large that the motor will never reach the end of it... but I dunno... and endless circle that is physical, and fits in the transmission ;). . Foremost its a highway gas saver, for when your cruising and dont need to move the gas pedal, and going faster isnt top priority, or pulling,. Its the same in a standard car... some have 1-4 plus overdrive. some have 1-5 plus overdrive. and alot of other combos... . less power used for coasting in overdrive. more used for acceleration. more used for pulling.... its only for cruising

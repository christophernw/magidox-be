I remember something like that happening to me before too. I don't know what the reason was. I just remember feeling as though it was taking a moment to think about me, to contemplate me. In a very deep way beyond what a human mind could do. It just looked at me. . . Of course I suppose it could have been a night terror. Whatever it was I was scared as hell. . . In a way, i'm actually thankful that it happend. Because at least I know what it's actually like to be so scared that I couldn't move or make a sound. Understanding that feeling may come in useful someday.

first tell me u r also apart of people what effect do u hav when u listen music.it even depends on aperson does he/she. likes to listen music.but on me-.  - it makes my mind calm and relaxed .whenever i m tired i switch over to music systems with my collections .i even prefer it during exams i think that it refreshes me and whatever u hav studied stays in ur mind for longer.after my regular classes i like to play guitar,my keyboard and to even sing songs which makes me happy(as god has given me quite gud sense of music and voice)and afterwards my list of works continues.for me music is everything it can teach aperson to be calm,polite a gud human,and to take out some time for god in his/her busy schedule.it is everything for me its in my soul  its in my blood.i think i am born to learn music.and even my name stand for it thats "SUR" which means "MUSIC"

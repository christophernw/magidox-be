For the sake of arguing. Some people enjoy arguments and get kicks when other people get ticked off also. I like to argue on occasion but only to prove my point or to be comedic, while some just have hate in their hearts. If they really want to argue, join Debate class. Geez!. . Ans some people have head colds such as me. This would make me literally "sick in the head."

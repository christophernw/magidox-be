Invent something really, really clever, that will make them sit up and take notice, then you can jolly well tell them what to do, and make sure they never make any mistakes, EVER again..... . Really, just go and do a degree in engineering, you will get in as a mature student, or do an OU degree.. You sound clever enough.

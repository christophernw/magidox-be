Of course you're right, but the thing that REALLY gets me mad is the people who don't YIELD to oncoming traffic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  They come barreling out onto the highway  leaving me to wonder where MY car is supposed to go when I have tractor trailors in front of and behind me and more traffic on my left side??????????????&*$^%#

Personally i think its all nonsense-its a shame that you should be judged by your religion and your religious beliefs, as to what you can or cannot do in this life... At the end of the day, this just leads to religious hatred. People should be accepted for their beliefs and their religion and respected regardless.. . i think we should all move on with the times and stop believing in fairy tales!

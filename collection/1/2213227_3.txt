Sunshower is an expression which refers to "rain while the sun shines" in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and also in parts of Britain. Surprisingly the word appears only in a few dictionaries. This word exists in many languages. A great many of them have animal associations, often to do with marriage (or, that activity for which the word marriage may be considered a suitable euphemism).

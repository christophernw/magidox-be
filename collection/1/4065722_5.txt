Great question, considering there are 4 key costs to gas, the high point could still be much higher near and far term.  Tbe cost of crude is perhaps the biggest near and long term factor.  Near term, events like storms in the gulf and terror or war threaths over Iran could impact the basic cost of crude, some say there is alreadya  $10.00 per barrel terror cost.  If something happens in the Starit of Hormuz or the Saudi ports the costs could jump 25 or more er barrel.  The second big factor is the summer in the US and western Europe.  Since most imported oil is used to produce electricity, near term hot summers could drive the cost of crude up.  Long term more solar, wind and nuke plants on line could keep this factor form growing.  The 3rd factor is the capacity to refine crude to gas, America has not added capacity in 30 years, yet the demand for gas has only grown as mileage has decreased thus a gian lack of capacity is a problem.  Lastyl, the wild card, will Americans switch from suvs to more efficent cars?  The more who do, will demand less gas, meaning less pull on the other factors form crude demand to lack of capacity to reach the demand. Short term I see $4.00 a gallon average this summer.

If you wish to make a suggestion about your superiors personality, the best thing may be just to grin and bear it. However, if you have a business idea you may want to bring it up in a casual conversation after work, or if your boss is more formal or you do not want him to take credit for the idea, give his secretary a dated essay outlining your idea and how it should be implemented. This will also work well with parents or teachers.

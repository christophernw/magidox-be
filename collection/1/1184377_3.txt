I live in North Florida and we have had sunny days 60 days straight.  I lived in Massachusetts (where it is flooding now) and Sunny Days were a rare event.  I love this part of Florida.  Miami is crazy.  This part has seasons.  Winters at worst 20 degrees at night but by afternoon 60 degrees.  Up until July, 80's in the day and 50's at night.  July and August are hot and muggy but winters are dry.  Much cheaper here to live too and no real threat of hurricanes as the beach is 80 miles away!

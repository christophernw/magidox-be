There is a way. But I would not advise it. One mistake and you can split all the atoms of the world. Imagine a world of split atoms!. . One thing for sure SAdam Hussein would have like to build one. Why I was never sure. But No One has found such a machine in his possesion . May be he is hidding it somewhere and would not tell anybody.. . Imagine what such a machine would do it would destroy all the Masses of the world.. . I certainly would not recomend anyone to use one.

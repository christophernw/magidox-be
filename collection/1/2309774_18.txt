because they shouldn't go over there to fight in a war for our "C" average president, i know in ways they are fighting for their country and for our protection, its just that people that have had a loss of a solider or a close friend that is how they just express their anger.  I'm not saying I'm against  the war because I'm not (hello its for my protection) but this war is already settled and its time for our troops to come back....they are trying to handle another countries problems....who cares let that other country solve their own problems...anyway i agree with you and i also think that its time this war is over.

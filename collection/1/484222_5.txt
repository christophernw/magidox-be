Its a business tactic to show people that they are making money in tenths and they cannot mark the price further down just like other prices as 99 cents or $1.99 etc. To make people believe that price is under a dollar or two but in reality difference is just 1 cent.. . Gas companies make billions of dollars profit but fool people that this is the lowest they can go by charging in tenths. This trend will continue even though everybody knows that there is no denomination representing 10th of a penny.

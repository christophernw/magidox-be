I don't know why but I will say that you have to find your place in society, and don't think for one second you are any less than any other race.  You are just as strong as any other man and the fact that you have so much potential that you hadn't tapped into yet can be intimidating for some.  But you have to take the good with the bad and keep your head up!!!!!

Raysin is right. You might have to put your dogs on a leash to help them get it right at first.  Also it wouldn't hurt to spray the driveway with some bleach in a hudson sprayer to get rid of the scent.  When they attempt to go to the driveway you can slap a news paper against your hand to make a noise letting them know you don't want them to go in the gravel.  Squirt them with a squirt gun.

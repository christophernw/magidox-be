Do you mean "What are tampons?"  I don't know what a tampoon is if that is what you were really looking for read no further.  A tampon is an absorbent device that is inserted into the canal from which menstrual blood flows.  It just absorbs the blood so that it doesn't get all over the lady's clothing and feels a little cleaner than a sanitary napkin.

Unfortunately being a puppies they most likely have parasites.  This is nothing to be alarmed about, you need to take prompt care of this as many of the common parasites are zooinotic (humans can be infected).  Take your puppies to the vet with samples of the stool.  If one of them is infected your vet will treat them all.  AND frankly if they are negative, the vet will most likely treat them regardless.  The reason being is that pending the parasite they may not be mature enough to shed eggs (prepatent period) or are just not shedding at the time the sample was collected (i.e. whips).  BOTTOM line is get them to the vet to be treated and police up all of the stool they leave behind as this will be a route of reinfection for the animals (USE care picking up the stool, and wash your hands after ;-) )...  Hope this helps. . Additionally this may be a helpful site to review:. http://www.ah.novartis.com/pet_health/en/dog/worms/index.shtml

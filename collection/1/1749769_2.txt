Think about it this way, if you don't finish college, your chances for getting a job that pays anything decent dissappears almost.  You could be stuck flipping burgers, washing dishes, or cleaning up messes on aisle 4 for the rest of your life.  Don't get me wrong, these jobs are all needed, but thats what they are, just jobs, not a career.

In the end of times, people will be decieved through many things to draw them away from the Truth of Christ... Evolution is one of them. People have a inate sense of something bigger, more real, and they want to know where they came from. Then with all the lies in the world around them, they turn to an answer that wont get them persecuted and that they believe has to be true.

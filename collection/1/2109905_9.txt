There are several skin conditions that cause peeling of the skin. If you have had a fever, it could cause retention of sweat in the thicker parts of the skin such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There are also fungal infections that can make the skin peel. The most common reason is dry skin or allergies.. I would get a good moisturizing lotion (unscented), and before going to bed I would massage it into my hands. Then I would sleep with disposable gloves on. It should improve your condition within a week ir so. . If nothing works, you will need to see a doctor.

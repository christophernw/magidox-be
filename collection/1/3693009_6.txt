I think it's partly because we want to see that people who we think have it all, have problems too. I think it in some way makes us feel better about ourselves if someone who is a superstar, or just really beautiful can be cheated on, or is going through a divorce too, it makes them seem more human and it makes us feel better about our shortcomings.

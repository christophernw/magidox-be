I'm not sure - I'm not a doctor or a nurse, I'm not even a dietician or even someone who knows anything about health but I would say you vomit because your body can't handle peanuts. . You can still eat them it's just that you will vomit every time you do. If you go on a dinner date try to avoid the satay beef as this might cause an embarrassing moment for you. There is life after peanuts.

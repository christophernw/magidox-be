Why are religious nuts so offensive about them? We can't get defensive if you don't get offensive. If you don't like it then stop asking questions that trigger a defensive response. By doing this you are making yourself the problem. Just go to church and put you head in the sand you ignorant child. Only come out when you can admit that there is no god. Let us have our say.

God is both male and female in characteristics.  According to the bible, there is neither male nor female in heaven.   God is Father, but He is not a male like we are on earth.  God Himself is  Spirit. . . Do not try to figure Him out through sociology, psychology or through the Feminist Movement theories.  He is what He is!   He is not inntimidated by an American mindset.

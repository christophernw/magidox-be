The yellow-orange stigmas from a small purple crocus flower.  It's the world's most expensive spice; each flower provides only three stigmas, which must be carefully hand-picked and then dried, an extremely labor-intensive process. It takes over 14,000 of these tiny stigmas for each ounce of saffron.. . Cheers

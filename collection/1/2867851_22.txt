its not a choice, god or evolution, you can believe both and be perfectly happy. some believe that genesis was told in the format it's in so that ancient people would understand it. remember, the bible was written thousands of years ago. as such its not a fact, its just trying to drive the point that god made everything, it doesn't really matter how. maybe he even helps along evolution or whatever happened that got us to this place.  . . others believe that the bible is a factual story, and if even one part of it is shown to be untrue, it means the whole thing isn't true, which isn't logical. it just shows that maybe that story isn't true, but not that the whole thing is wrong, you can't apply one part to the whole in such a way. which is why they get so defensive about evolution, they feel thier faith is at stake. . . but in both cases evolution does not disprove god, it just helps us understand what was going on before people started writing sh!t down.

I'm with Tim Tim on this one.  My cat does the same thing when he has ear mites, and even if I can't see the black granulars, my vet can.  Three days after the medicine he will stop itching, but you CAN'T clean out their ears for at least another week, because the medicine stays in the wax to kill the eggs once they hatch. I use revolution now, and it works GREAT.  Gets heart worm and fleas as well, all in one little tube less than 1/4 the size of my finger, just apply to the back of the neck, and you're good for a month.  :)

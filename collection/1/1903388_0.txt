I can only answer for myself; it is not so much *eating* meat that I consider cruel, it is *how* the animals that provide that meat are treated. For example, most chicken comes from "factory farms" - the chickens are so crowded, they have to have their beaks removed; otherwise they would eat each other when they go insane. Do a web search on factory farming and cruelty - no other animal treats their prey that badly!

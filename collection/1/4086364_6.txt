This is an excellent question, better than most of them. :D I think it's something to do with the mindset of freedom and how we can cram so much more stuff in a day that we want to do, and having the constrictions of an alarm makes us want to not do anything we have to do. Rebellious human mindset, i guess. ~Moony

He's an idiot, but he's tried more than once to get the draft reinstated, this time the republicans are outvoiced and they may not feel like voting at all or pulling any parlimentary tricks to stop it, they're a little pissed right now at voters, especially at young voters and war protestors who aren't going to like a draft. Economically it's a total nightmare. A ten fold increase in the army which has had it's spending slashed, cannibalizing it's own equipment for parts,  and bases closed and carved up into developements, that will have to have new bases, new facilities, new equipment, etc. etc.?  What happened to the "no new taxes" and "pay off the deficit" pledge by  blue dog democrats? Besides an unwilling drafted army is your enemies' best friend. And historically when any nation has a huge military they feel inclined to use it to justify having it, and plunder other nations for the raw resources and finances to support it.

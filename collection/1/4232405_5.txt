take her out to explore the world. hiking, camping, swimming ect.. her out of her own little world of hers and show her there is a whole new world just for her. my girlfriend, now my wife, was the same way. i took her out of her misery and showed her the outside world. now we enjoy ghost hunting together, and its just awsome that i may have saved a life and i would not be here now to share with you my experience.never give up!

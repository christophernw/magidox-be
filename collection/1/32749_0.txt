Thats because changing the time has nothing to do with the seasons, its all to do with day length. It was actually abolished in the UK in the late 70's to see what would happen and it proved too dangerous...kids were going to school in the morning in total darkness during the winter.. They have it all over the world, its the same in the US, they just call it daylight saving time

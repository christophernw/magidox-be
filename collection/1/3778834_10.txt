You don't want to just "Cover" the smell...that's gross.  You need to steam clean your carpet and then use fabreze... . The fabreze will actually help kill the smell without the steam cleaning...but there will still be pee in the carpet.. . Trust me...it's worth the 100 bucks to not be wading ankle deep in a sea of pee...Steam Clean the carpet.. . And if you have new accidents...I pour hot water on the spot as soon as it happens...and then I suck it all out with a wet dry vac...keeps the carpet clean, gets the pee out of the carpet and the place smells and IS clean.

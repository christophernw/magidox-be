first sign is not tender breat because u don't always get that when u first fall pregnant I am pregnant and know. and some woman get tender breats from simply just having their period in the first place. the only sign in the early stages are period miss, you may be tired, want to eat more, feel sick but not actual vomiting, and take a blood or urine test.

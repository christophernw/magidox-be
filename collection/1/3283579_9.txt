I loved that book as a fiction i love it even more now that it's pissed off the church! . make you wonder . when you ask a little kid what are you doing. if he's not doing anything wrong he will tell you what ever he is doing. . However if he's doing what he knows he shouldnt he will respond with "nothing" . the fit the church is throwing it kinda makes you wonder if maybe dan brown imagination is closer to the truth then even he knows

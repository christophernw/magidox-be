Most dogs are scared by sharp sudden noises like coach whistles, pennies in an empty soda can, mice traps, etc.  When we were training our dog not to get on the furniture, the trainer told us to put mouse traps on the furniture and cover them with a sheet of newspaper.  When the dog gets on the furniture, the trap will snap and the noise will make them get off the furniture, but the newspaper will keep the trap from snapping the dog.

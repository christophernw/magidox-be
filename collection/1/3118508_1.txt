The same part of the brain that registers chemical impressions on the synapse when decisions about statements/events are made. The reaction is supposed to trigger a memory, thereby eliminating confusion. Sometimes the memories are either non-existant, or not well impressed(can't remember something) and the connection between the statement/event and previous knowlege can't be made. Confusion results and the brain does not impress the present event as a realization, but instead as an unknown.

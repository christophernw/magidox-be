Bacteria are the simplest, organisms, found in most natural environments. They are sperical or rod-shaped, commonly several micrometers in linear dimension. They often possess a tough protective coat called a cell wall, beneath which a plasma membrane encloses a single cytoplasmic compartment containing DNA, RNA, proteins and small molecules. . They are microscopic and can replicate quickly, simply dividing in two by binary fission.

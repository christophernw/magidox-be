Yes, I have found that by purchasing both body fat percentage scales (Tanita) and body fat callipers (Accu-Measure), you can get an accurate idea of your body fat percentage by cross-referencing the two readings. Using body fat callipers does take a little practice, but if you find the two readings are similar or the same, then you can be pretty sure that it is a fairly accurate measurement of your body fat percentage. Both of these items can be purchased through Ebay for reasonable prices. HTH : )

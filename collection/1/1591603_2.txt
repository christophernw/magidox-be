It all depends on what type of phone you have and your carrier, I got Alltel and my cellphone has a Axcess Apps on it, that is the only place where I can get ring tones, backgrounds, etc through there, you cant go to those free ring tone websites to get them cause you can only get it through Axcess Apps, If you have Axcess Apps on your phone that is the only place where you can get ring tones.  To find out without checking your manual is go to your menu on your cellphone and if there is a icon that says apps then that is Axcess Apps.  Hope this helps.

I agree-the US needs to step in and help the poor people in the Sudan and Darfur. That we have not done so is a crime. But what problem do you have with France?  You sound just like one of my close relatives! Actually, as one who is fairly liberal I don't have a problem recognizing evil-in myself or in others. Its present everywhere, just as good is.  Its just that I  rarely confront it  because its a "live and let live" world for me. I would  step in to report an accident or a crime being committed.  And  when I recognize ongoing abuse I do try to help. Trouble there is that many caught up in abusive situations don't want  help. I don't hate Bush; I just think he's a nasty,  limited little man, drunk with power as many of ALL political persuasions are. I do vote and express myself in that way.  So many things are beyond my immediate control. So what I do on a daily basis is just to try and bring a little something positive to life by not causing harm or pain to myself or others. Blaming and finger pointing  does nothing  but  cause more problems. And the world doesn't need more problems.

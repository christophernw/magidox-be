You don't convert to a denomination.  The denomination should help you grow in your faith though.  Christianity is about a relationship with Jesus Christ.  Find a Bible believing church such as Assemblies of God,  Full Gospel, Community Bible church. There are many denominations that teach the same stuff with different styles.   Stay away from any that don't believe Jesus to be the son of God, or that add stuff to the Bible like the Mormons and Jehovah Witnesses.

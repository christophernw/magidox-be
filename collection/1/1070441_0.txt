For some, a horn is a cheery way to say "Oh my goodness, I certainly can't drive, and have no understanding of Newton and his relevence to my own impending doom, but I think *this* button my be the answer to my problems."  It isn't, of course.. . For others, the horn exclaims, in a loud and irate way, "I am a complete encephalofecal idiot, and you'd best get out of my way because as such, I would not be responsible for my own actions should I lose control of my vehicle, my emotions, or my bodily functions."  Message received, loud and clear.

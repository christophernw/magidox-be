becuase most religions say they believe the bible and follow it, but then they act on things contrary to its teachings. eating of blood can also be read is takin it in, and intraveniously is taking blood in. blood is considered sacred and in God's eyes, shouldnt be given out to anyone. And whwen Jesus said eat my blood, he was holding wine and meant it symbolically, not literally.

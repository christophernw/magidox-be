Maybe what you are selling is NOT true Christianity.  Maybe what you're selling is intollerance for ideas / beliefs different from your own.  Maybe you're simply disappointed that others choose to think for themselves, and you're not winning their loyalty.. . I've been reading, studying, and pondering the Bible for over 35 years, and the last things I want is for some know-it-all religionist to be thumping their ignorance at me.  I think their piety, emotionalism, dogmatism, and whining is repulsive to say the least.

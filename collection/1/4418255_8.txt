As people stated earlier, YOU cannot put a tip onto a credit card receipt, even with the permission of the card owner. Usually, the customer adds the tip amount on the receipt after they receive the credit slip to sign.. . I think what your boss means is that tips paid by credit card by law has to be reported by your boss as part of your INCOME which will be taxed. Also, in many restaurants, tips are pooled (which I do not think is fair), and shared amongst all waitstaff, etc.. . If you get cash as a tip, you basically pocket the money TAX FREE (though technically this is supposed to be reported as income as well).. . What I do when dining in a restaurant is to pay my bill by credit card, DO NOT LEAVE A TIP VIA CREDIT CARD (it is also a way for me to know if any fraudulent amount was added to my charge card also), but I will tip by cash -- so the server can get the money.

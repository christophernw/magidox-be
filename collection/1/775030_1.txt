The nuclear charge of any atom is the same as the number of protons in the atom's nucleus.  Each proton has one positive charge.  The nuclear charge is also the same as the atomic number of the element, which can be found on any periodic chart.  It's the first number in the element's box, and it is never a decimal number; it's always whole.  For potassium, this number is 19, which means that there are nineteen protons in an atom of potassium and +19 is the nuclear charge.  . The 39 indicates the atomic mass of the atom.  In nature, different numbers of neutrons (the other nuclear particle) can be found in different potassium atoms.  This applies to virtually any atom species. For example, hydrogen atoms can have 0, 1, or 2 neutrons in their nuclei but always only one proton.  In a potassium-39 atom, there must be 19 protons because all potassium atoms have nineteen protons.  Each proton contributes one atomic mass unit to the total mass of the atom, which is 39.  There are only two particles that contribute to atomic mass: protons and neutrons, which have neutral (no) charge.  That means that 20 of the 39 must be neutrons because 19 of the 39 are protons. . 20 neutrons + 19 protons = 39 total mass.

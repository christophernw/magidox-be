The "best" Caribbean destination depends on what you are looking for in your vacation travel. While all of the Caribbean island are similar in many ways, each one is still very unique and has different attributes/ strongpoints that will likely make a particular island more appealing depending on your primary interests. . . For example, if you are interesed in West Indian Carnival, then Trinidad perhaps has the best carnival in the entire Caribbean. If you are a music lover, then Trinidad and Jamaica both stand out with their Calypso and Reggae, respectively.. . If you like watersports, Antigua and Barbados are places to consider.. . If you are the shopping type, St. Maarten is an island to consider.. . If you are the outdoor or adventurer type, look no furthur than DOMINICA (note that Dominica is NOT the Dominican Republic!). Dominica is the outdoor lovers paradise with the very best in hiking, mountain biking, diving, horseback riding, whale watching, bird watching, and more.. . http://cgi.ebay.com/4-Nights-Caribbean-Vacation-Holiday-for-2-in-Dominica_W0QQitemZ6621372797QQcategoryZ29579QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem

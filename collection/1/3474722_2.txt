Nothing. The Easter bunny and eggs have to do with the Pagan celebrations. Rabbits and eggs are a sign of fertility and the return of Spring, which Pagans worshiped (and still worship today). When the Catholic church was still in its beginnings, they chose the holidays (like Christmas and Easter) and they did NOT "coincidentally" happen to fall on or near those that the Pagans celebrated. They deliberately chose the days that they did so that they would "keep" the Pagan converts that they had, so they made the celebrations very festive and public, so that they could observe who celebrated them and who didn't. Those that didn't were prosecuted as non-believers and killed.

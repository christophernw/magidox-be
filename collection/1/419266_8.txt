Because they can still afford to drive them.   The price of gas does not affect everyone the same, contrary to what is advertised by the liberal media.   . . I had a full sized pick up truck up until the gas prices hit $3.15 here, then traded down for a small economical car with great gas mileage.   I drive a substantial amount and couldn't afford $200 a week in gas.   I certainly miss my truck and would love to have another one, but I definitely don't miss the gas bill.. . If I was making twice what I make now, I would have kept the truck and wouldn't have thought another second about it.  What I fear though...is that gas prices will continue to climb and even my economical car won't be good enough.   I'd hate to start walking 30 miles to/fro work every day.

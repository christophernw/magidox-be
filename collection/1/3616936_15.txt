Well I'm sure many people  probably think its  political sidetracking, but to say there has been no wave of immigration, where have you been..  This is the largest immigration in United States history.The only one that even comes close was the Irish immigration of the late 1800's and that was in total about 2 million people, when it was said and done.We are talking 12 million people here,its not a wave its a tsunami..  Human trafficking,established drug cartels and supply lines,domestic abuse, and overwhelming stress on the social service programs,with billions of dollars in missed tax revenue,certainly couldn't have had anything to do with it..  And yes it does provide for the funneling of major bucks into the already heavy pockets of homeland security, but that's a byproduct,the problems illegal immigration present,and the incomprehensible number of people we are talking about existed before the department of homeland security ever existed.

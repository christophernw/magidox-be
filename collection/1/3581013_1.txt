Sugar makes things more palatable.  Sometimes we use sugar to hide the bitter tastes of the world, and other times we use sugar to bring out flavor. Sugar makes it easier to swallow things that we would rather not eat.  . . To live without sugar is a dietary sacrifice. If you are serious about leaving it behind, I would suggest not eating fish from cans--or dehydrated fruit.  Find it fresh--eat in the season.

Its not that I dont believe in him. I am agnostic.... meaning I know/ believe there is something out there... such as a higher power... I just dont know what. There is a certain lack of credibility in what I believe. You are being asked to believe in something that scientifically is not possible (such as walking on water, or turning water to wine). I am not "anti-jesus" by any means. I would just like more factual proof rather than some stories (the bible) written by the deciples (friends) of Jesus

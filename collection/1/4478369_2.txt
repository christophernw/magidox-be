Egypt had a very, very hot dry climate.  This particular country only has two seasons in the year.  The seasons are very hot summers and very mild (not so cold) winters.  Summers usually last from May to October and the average temperature is 95 degrees Fahrenheit.  This was probably the reason that the ancient Egyptians’ houses were made with open windows that didn’t have any glass, so the air could flow though the windows.. . The winters in Egypt were very warm for that time of year.  Winters in Egypt last from November to April.  The average winter temperature is 48 degrees Fahrenheit.  The houses were ready for what little cold there was.  The houses were built with layers of cloth on the open windows to keep most of the chill outside.. . There was more rain in the winter season than in the summer.  The houses would be hard enough to stay up when it did rain, though they would have a tough time because they were made out of clay.  The Egyptian that lived near rivers weren’t so dependent on rain for their crops, but the people that didn’t live near a river definitely were, otherwise they would starve or have to hunt.  Maybe they would also eat bread.. . The yearly flood of the Nile River can spread water to farm fields far across the land, so the crops also grew there.  The only problem with that is that the flood happened once a year from July to October.  In this way Egyptians that didn’t live near the Nile would mostly have to rely on the Nile flood to water their crops or the little rain that would fall.  Egypt was mostly filled with sandy deserts.  This is why most of the population lived by the Nile Riverbanks.  Egyptians were equipped (for the most part) for their long seasons.

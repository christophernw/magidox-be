well we saw how church created miracles done by mother teresa. she may have been very devoted lady but till she was alive i never heard about any of it. if there have been it would have been so much in news for the most strong media is christian. but to declare her saint as soon as possible they have to bend many rules and they needed some miracle story. so they did it. just wait and her miracles will grow.. . it is not a christian only thing either. jews tell fantastic stories. buddhist also made up too many to give more divinity to buddha. so many stories are added to krishna that to find out real krishna is a major task. practically everybody did it.. .  do you know buddha predates jesus and church had many things similar in its administration. he had a prostitute Amrapali who converted and became his deciple. if you really compare many stories gave similar vibes though very different cultures.. .  but the added stories does not mean that they were not great persons. it is just that their followers thought they would look more shinning if described in some other way. . . da vinchi code is not that much of a strech . though it is a fiction after all. some theories can be true it is quite probable .

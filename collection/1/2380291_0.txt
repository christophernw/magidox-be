That's not a very smart thing to do.  You might get into alot of trouble not only with a doctor who's name you used but at work too if they found out it was a fake note.  You didn't say how long you missed or why, but why not just tell them you didn't go to the doctor, you just recouped at home, and you have a date for a complete check up at a later time.  Also if you really have to have a note, if you know anyone who has a husband, brother, sister, ect who is a doctor maybe they would write one for you.  But don't get yourself in trouble for doing something in haste, it's not worth it.. . PS most places would accept any medical professionals note like a dentist, chiropractor, etc. so maybe that might help you if you could get one from a doctor that way.

A glacier is a river of ice, mostly on land. It is fed by snowfields in the mountains and flows down a valley, like a very slow moving river, until it meets with the sea or a lake.. . An iceberg is a large piece of ice floating in water. It may have broken off a glacier or it may have been part of an ice shelf (a continuous field of ice usually floating on water but not moving).

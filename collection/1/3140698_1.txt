Start with pre-calc and build up. Register to audit classes in your local college, it shouldn't be expensive, but very important. It's hard to teach yourself math, however, if you get a good book (I found Steward Single Variable and Multi-Variable Calculus pretty straightforward), you can learn it. Practice a lot, math is time consuming.

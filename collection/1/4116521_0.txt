What's it on?. . I used to work in a lab where we used 95% ethanol to remove Sharpie from our petri dishes.  You should be able to buy ethanol as "ethyl rubbing alcohol" (this is different from regular rubbing alcohol) or Everclear.  However, you'll want to check what you're putting it on first, because ethanol might eat the surface you're trying to remove the Sharpie from, like if it's on wood or something.

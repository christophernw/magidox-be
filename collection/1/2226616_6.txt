Phone your local town council or environment agency. They will send out a professional for a nominal fee (around Â£20/$40 but ask for a quote first) who will deal with the matter promptly and in a humane way. More importantly, seeing just one mouse may be a sign that there are ALREADY more around that you cannot see - so simply killing this one might not solve the problem. A professional can eradicate them completely.

I also have a shi-tzu at home. I used the puppy pads and a secure room. When I wasn't available to keep an eye on him, I kept him locked in the laundry room with a baby gate and put down a puppy pad for him. (this is not as cruel as it sounds, I had a radio on all the time for him, and the room is attached to the kitchen so he could see me all the time through the gate) The only time he was allowed out, was when I could watch him and reprimand him for pottying on the floor. They should never be allowed to roam the house freely, if you leave the room, make them follow you, that way you can always keep an eye on them and no mistakes are made on the floor. Never spank or rub their nose in it. Catch them while in the act and pick up and say no-no while taking them outside. Always take them outside about 10-15 minutes after eating, and right after they wake up from a nap, first thing in the morning (and I mean before you even pee), and right before bed time. He was potty trained by the time he was 6 months old.. . And NEVER leave food down all the time. For babies, they need to be fed atleast twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening, but not close to bed time. When she is done eating, pick it up immediately. Always feed her about 2 to 3 hours before bed time so she can get it all out of her system.

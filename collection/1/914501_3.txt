well i can say this can be simplified into acceptable behaviour and social norm... we must know as an individual we cannot live alone, we all need society and society needs you...with existence of individuals comes society.. so what is social conscience? it is just that you must realise sometimes you have to give away some freedom in order to gain advantage in another form..for instance we are bounded to the law of a country, as a compensation you gain access to public facilities and development..social conscience is a point where you must realise your own duty to the society.. you are to release some of your freedoms for better good of everyone

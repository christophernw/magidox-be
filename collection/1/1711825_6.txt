It is not ok, it is the way the person takes it. Maybe some white don't mind being called such words. Black people are more serious of what they are called because of their history probably. White people have always (in history) thought that they were superior, but colored people (in history) have been treated horrible. This still goes on. This is probably why colored people get more offended that white people. I am Puerto rican but I don't have the color. Still, everyday in school a stupid white person (always white don't know why) says something about me speaking spanish with my friend. I got black friends since white people have a problem with me being Hispanic. It's probably in the history and what has been taught to the person. White people do not have a huge history of being victims of prejudice, colored people have a huge history on this. I understand why colored people get offended and white people don't, but I do know white people that get very offended with such words.

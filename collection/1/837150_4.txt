at any temperature, some of the molecules are fast enough to leave the surface and become gas (remember that even in days when the temperature is below zero, the clothe that you hang outside will dry) the gas that forms above a liquid in every temperature, has a pressure. this is called partial pressure. the partial pressure will rise with temperature. when the partial pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure, we say that the liquid is boiling. some materials have such week bonds between their molecules that their partial pressure is very high, so they will boil in negative temperature. because of their week bonds they need even lower temperatures to freeze. for example Helium is gas until around 4K (it's -269C) and is liquid between 4 to 1 K. no one has ever seen the solid helium.

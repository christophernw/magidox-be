The critical methods that these ads have leaned toward is less than uncivilized. I don't want to hear what the other person isn't, I want to hear what you can do to make this country better. And they wonder why the percentage of voters becomes less and less. We are all fed up with their political agenda against the incumbants and lack of ingenuity in coming up with a genuine platform of their own. Still, we live in a country that gives us the opportunity to express our opinion, and we can not complain if we don't support that opinion through our right to vote. See ya at the polls tomorrow!!!

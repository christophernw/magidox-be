The rays of the sun cause the air to warm up, creating what are known as "convection cells".  These convection cells cause air to circulate, creating differences in temperature and pressure.  When you feel a sea breeze during the summer, it is because the there is a convection cell generated as the air over the beach rises from the hot sand and sinks over the cooler water, creating a wind effect.  Try this little experiment if you want to see what a convection cell looks like:. . 1.  Obtain a pyrex glass bowl and fill it with water.. 2.  Place bowl with water on a gas burner and let it come to a boil. 3.  When water starts to boil, add a few drops of iodine and watch watch happens to the iodine as it traces out the convection cell in the boiling water. . Basically, the gradient in temperature (temperature distrubution) throughout the water causes differences in pressure which starts to create the currents.  This is the same thing that happens in our atmosphere and generates wind.

Their is a program that you can download called Emulators. Its basically a virtural playstation 2 on your computer. You download this program, and also many games that are available for it. To my knowledge, this is Legal, as long as you have the games in physical form, meaning that you have the game Spiderman the Movie on game that was purchased. The emulators can be found anywhere if you look hard enough.

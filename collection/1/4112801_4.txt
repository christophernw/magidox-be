jesus did not come to enhance the spread and influence of judaism or mossaic laws...he came to establish a new movement called in the later stage...christianity.. . if jesus was pro-judaism..the jews would not have crucified him on allegations of heresy and diversion..see?,. . christianity is a totally different  thing from judaism.its just like oil and water.

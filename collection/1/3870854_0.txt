Fuze Energize.  It doesn't have any caffeine in it.  Instead it's got ginseng, Siberian Guarana, Vitamins B6, B12, C.  You drink a bottle of that and an hour later you're like: "Let's all go for a jog!"  And it's not that twitchy, nervous energy you get with caffeine; it's more of an "I ate my wheaties today" energy.

I agree with the first answerer...it would help to have more details. Did you complete your seminary studies? Maybe that would be the first step - to complete your courses. And, have you served in a parish or monastery yet? (I'm sorry, I don't know the process) That would be the second step, I suppose? What about a spiritual retreat of silence?. . I just finished reading a novel called "The Mermaid's Chair" by Sue Monk Kidd and the plot involved a priest questioning his vows. It might be something you'd enjoy for two reasons. God bless.

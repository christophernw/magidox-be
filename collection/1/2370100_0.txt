Are you insane?!  Firefighters were the heroes of 9/11, at least that's what I think you mean by 911.  Many gave their lives to rescue as many people as possible from the burning towers.  They desrve to be honored on 9/11 and everyday for the valuable service they provide and the risks they take to make sure others are safe.

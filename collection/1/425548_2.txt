There is a God who created the earth.  How can one know this? Consider these facts:. . Entropy is a scientific law that was identified in the last 100 years which states that everything progresses from order to chaos. We see it in every aspect of life and nature. As time goes by things deteriorate. This means that everything had a beginning and will have an ending. Something that has no beginning or ending had to set everything into motion and that was God. Any model of life that omits God requires that entropy not exist, that life and existence naturally become more orderly, but there is not one natural property that works this way.. . Additionally consider design. Humans have a natural tendency to worship, history proves this. Life is very sophisticated and advanced. DNA is a complicated digital error correcting code. We see animals that have abilities and systems that complement each other. For example a spider has the ability to spin a sticky web and because of the hair on the spider it can walk on the web without a problem. Evolution will insist that the spider evolved over much time and with many small changes. What happened first, did the web become sticky or did the spider get hair? In either case the spider could not survive without both attributes working together. Life clearly is well beyond the sophistication that can be achieved by random chance.. . Finally, the scientific process really is not able to prove the origin of all things. The scientific process is about making a hypothesis, testing that hypothesis and then possibly coming to some sort of conclusion. Until we can observe life spontaneously forming from nothing we cannot scientifically prove that life came from nothing or without a creator.. . There is a God and not just any God, a loving and personal God who wants to reveal Himself to you. I encourage you to visit the links and consider this further.

It is probably due to lack of food (carbohydrates). This would have resulted in anemia. Due to lack of carbohydrates he cannot produce a lot of ATP which is the energy source in our body. Carbohydrates like glucose undergo glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation and Kreb's cycle to produce 36 ATP. Due to lack of glucose his body is not producing proper ATP so that is the reason behind his tiredness.

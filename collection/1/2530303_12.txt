because she is 16 years old,  stupid and have a loser boyfriend that is 17.    neither has enough education or skills to support themselves , much less a baby.  the girls parents dont want to raise the kid so they influence her to abort it.. . i know your next question--why not give it up for adoption?  because  after carrying a baby for 9 months, things change,   it becomes difficult to give it up.  they wind up keeping it.. . its a tough decision, not one that people make easily, and it can weigh on your mind for years.  i wish no one had abortions, but in many cases it is the best thing to do.

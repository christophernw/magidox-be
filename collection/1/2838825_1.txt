God has said that it IS his own words. I'm sorry, I do not have the exact scripture reference in front of me, but somewhere is says "All scripture is God-breathed". God was simply speaking through a human.. . The Bible does not contradict itself. When there seems to be a discrepancy, humans are simply misinterpreting it.. . The Ten Commandments do not say "Though shalt not be Homosexual". God has said it numerous times through scripture. It is one of the Laws, (I believe Deuteronomy) where it says "Though shall not have sexual relations with another man". Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed for that. Do you think God won't do it again sometime?

Sadly, I don't think there is a guaranteed cure - but here are some thoughts:. . Arthritis is often associated with the emotions. It might be that you CAN cure yourself if you help yourself to be less stressed and maybe think about having some counselling to talk about any difficult things in your life - now and in the past.. . (Have you read "You can heal your life" by Louise Hay?). . I used to have some early signs of arthritis and find it really helps to do some gentle exercise, every day if possible, or every other day at least. Tai Chi is good, or swimming....or yoga.....there are lots more.. . Diet can help - there is a white diet I heard of, eating fresh things like fish, chilcken, white (green) grapes....... . Hope this is of some help.

Get some help, sister. You're anorexic, and you don't know it. You'll die if you don't gain any weight. You'll die if you loose any more. I'd tell the doctor to send me back to the hospital, the doctors will help you reach a healthy weight, and teach you to stay at a healthy weight. Just tell him/her you are VERY concerned about being thin and at the right weight. GET SOME HELP!!

On a one on one situation, your arguement might seem unfair.   For instance, I know a guy that is a phenom when it comes to automotive repair.    He has been fixing cars (basically anything with a motor) since he was 10.   He's about 40 now and has been working in a garage all of his life.  He did graduate high school, but has no training other than that.    He now manages a Goodyear (which I believe sent him to their management classes and certification schools).    He knows and runs that particular store better than anyone else probably could (as he's been there forever and knows everything there is to know about it.)    On the automotive side, he can't be outdone.   On the administrative side, a person with a college degree would be able to handle the actual business side of it better than he does.

Right, but wrong. Jesus loved Mary just like he loves you and I and the rest of the world.  It didn't matter to Jesus if you were a prostitute , mass-murderer, or tax collector.  He loves them all the same.  Now Jesus says " You've heard it said of old that you shall not commit adultery (7th Commandment), but I say to you that if you even look at a woman to lust after her, you have already comitted adultery in your heart."  So, if you even look with lust you've broken God's law.  So, on Judgment Day God would see you as an adulterer at heart and find you guilty of sinning against His holy nature.  Therefore, He could not let you into Heaven.  He must send you to Hell, otherwise He wouldn't be the Just Judge that He is.  He must punish sin.  Fortunately for us, He is a loving God in that He sent His son, Jesus Christ to die for us on the cross taking the punishment we justly deserve.  If you repenet of your sins and trust Jesus to save you from God's perfect justice, then you will be made right before his holiness.  So forget about sex for money.  If you even think with lust it is a sin against God.

Judaism is a better authority on the nature of the biblical God than Christianity, which sprang from Judaism:. . In Judaism, God has no body, God is non-physical. Any mention of God's body is considered to be metaphorical.. . Any physical representation of God, such as the Golden Calf, is considered to be idolatry.. . As God has no body, He has no gender.. . While God is referred to in masculine terms and the Shechinah (Divine presence that fills the universe) is referred to in feminine terms, God is actually neither male nor female.

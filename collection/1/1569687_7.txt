This was a weekday and the amount of passengers would be low. This was also a time of year Sept. When people don't fly as often. This would help explain why so few people on plane. The lack of Muslim names means nothing! No shows you would have to talk to the no shows but this is exact reason Planes over book flights so it clearly happens often. Your looking for something that isn't there!

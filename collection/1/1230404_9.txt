Well, I am not christian. I was baptised a catholic but dont really fallow that road any more. All I can say if fallow your heart. If it leads to toungs and snake handeling so be it. If you end up singing happy faith songs in a really really sad way so be it, or if you choose to go the other way and pray to the goddess so be it. Either way you are right because that is you. Blessed Be ~~~*

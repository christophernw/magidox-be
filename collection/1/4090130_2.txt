You could try doing water changes with bottled water instead of using tap water.  Just be sure the water has not had a bunch of chemicals added to it to clean it for the bottling process. The more expensive route would be to get a water softener and do water changes with that. Ultimately you would end up diluting the calcium down. . . Depending on the inhabitants of your aquarium though, you may not want to drop it too much. Invertibrates tend to use the calcium in the water for their shells.

The only match I could find regarding ecg reports was "non-ischemic patients in sinus rhythm" (NISR).. . Ischemic means "A decrease in the blood supply to a bodily organ, tissue, or part caused by constriction or obstruction of the blood vessels". So I would presume that non-ischemic means that there is no decrease in blood supply to organs, OR that there is a decrease in blood supply, but it is not caused by constriction or obstruction to blood vessels.. . Sinus rhythm is the normal regular rhythm of the heart -. . SO - my guess would be that NLSR means a patient who has a normal heart beat and no decrease in blood supply. Sound quite normal to me.. . But then I'm not a doctor so don't ask me! ;-)

Sounds to me like you have had a bad experience with the church as a whole. It is very sad that you would let someone's opinion keep you from worshipping the One True God!! You obviously had your eyes on the people and what they were doing, instead of keeping your eyes on the Lord. Please don't give up on your search for a relationship with God because of a few self-righteous people. Remember that we are all HUMAN and make mistakes and forgiveness is a major part of God's plan. With out forgiveness you can never inherit the Kingdom. I will be praying for you!!

Pork has traditionally been a meat that requires longer cooking times and higher heat to remove the presence of bacteria and microscopic worms.  Thus the texts that outline the dietary standards for these civilizations and religions forbade pork due to health concerns.  This transposed into people considering that devils, demons and other denizens of evil resided in the porcine animals.  You can also see this effect in the Devil sometimes being seen with cloven hoof.

I'm not sure what bothers you so much about this.  Here are a couple of possibilities.. . Possibility number 1: You are afraid that people will think you're copying her.. I doubt this is true, because other people will surely have noticed that you wore something first.  Chances are she's also trying to hang around you and get your attention in other ways, and people will observe that.. . Possibility number 2: You think that you are the only person who has your fashion sense and you don't like the idea of not being unique.. This is basically an illusion put forward by the fashion industry.  Their basic message is "Be yourself by buying our clothing (just like everyone else is being themselves by buying our clothing).  So it's really not true in the first place.  But don't worry.  If people appreciate your fashion sense, they will recognize your creativity in it.  Like you said, you've been complimented on having your own style, so why would that change now?

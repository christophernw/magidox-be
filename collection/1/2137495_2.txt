hi, you should first take a look at the picture resolution( indicated in megapixels). The more the resolution, the greater the image quality. Next, you should consider the storage capacity(the amount of data that can be stored). It would also be useful to check if the camera has video recording capability(that is if it is not a camcorder). And finally, always check on the price!!

"White gold is an alloy of gold and at least one white metal, such as silver or palladium. ". . White gold rings are frequently coated with rhodium. Rhodium is similar to platinum and shares many of its properties, including its white color. because the natural color of white gold is light grey, rhodium plating makes white gold whiter.-. -------------------------------------------------------------------. There is no such thing as white gold!. There are however gold alloys which appear white, silvery, or grey.. When jewellers speak of white gold, they mean white gold alloys. In most other major languages these alloys are described as grey rather than white. We will stick to "white".. White gold alloys (nickel, zinc, or palladium with gold ) became fashionable in the 1920's, mainly as a substitute for platinum.

If this was proven to be true then this would in effect challenge the submissive role that woman play in the church.. This would mean there would be no reason that the church couldn't allow female priests, but it would also mean that woman can play a more powerful role in the shaping of minds.. ALSO if Jesus had married it would be probable that he had an heir, and if this was proven people would want to know the blood line of Jesus, foe many reasons, and one of these would be to prove his existing.. ALSO if Mary was an equal to Jesus she would have had an input into the bible, but there isn't SO either he wasn't married or the church is editing the bible for the masses due to the control aspect of such power.. . There!

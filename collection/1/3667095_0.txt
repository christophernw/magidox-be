Well, this is the time that she's gonna need you the most.  You need to accept this fact about her, then help her accept this fact.  Once she's accepted this fact, you'll notice her quality of life go up, and she'll appreciate even a flower in the grass.  She really needs you now, and it's your time to be there.   Maybe you two can cry together.  But be there for her, don't abandon her now, especially now, in her time of need.  Now is the time when she needs her "true friends" to appear.  Do as much as you can with her and for her.  She won't be here forever.  God bless both of you.....

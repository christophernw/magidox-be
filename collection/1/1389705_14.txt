dunno if im depressed I just go on a shooting game and run round like a maniac blasting away with the guns to take it out on the bad guys.  If you aren't a gamer then try watching a very funny tv program or film.  I recommend the program Takeshis Castle on challenge as that is the one of the most funny programs I have ever seen.

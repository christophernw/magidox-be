Sometimes your muscles ache after working out, either due to the lactic acid build-up or tightness of the muscles. They may also ache if you are dehydrated. If you are exerting a high effort, you may also increase the lactic acid build-up, or be working harder than your muscles are accustomed. Poor conditioning can make your muscles hurt!

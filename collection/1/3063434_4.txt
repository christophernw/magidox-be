nintendo has been aiming for the younger crowd... but with the Wii they are planning on throwing in some more adult games, why? becouse the motion sensative controler allows for much more complex gameplay. the Wii could becoume better for FPS then a PC! simply the controlor and the price put the Wii above other platforms. why pay $600 for something just like a PS2 but with better graphics when you can pay $250 for something that still has great graphics but also revalutionary gameplay?. . btw, the projecter is going to be a sold seporitly option (I think) but I know it dosn't come with the system.

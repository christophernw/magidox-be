There is no such thing as a celestial equinox. "Equinox" mean "equal night," and occurs on earth twice a year (vernal or spring equinox and autumnal or fall equinox) when the day and the night are of equal duration. This is due to the fact that the earth's axis is tilted with respect to its orbit around the sun. It would only apply to a planet or a moon, and only if the axis was tilted.

There are girls out there that are tomboys, not girlly girls. They like hanging out with guys because they share the same interest. I'm not a Butch, but I love video games, some sports, and other boy activities. I don't like makeup, and I'm friends with the guys. I do have some friends that are girls. I'm a tomboy.

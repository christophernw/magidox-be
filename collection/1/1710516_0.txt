This is not an official term in psychology, but any severe nervous condition that makes it impossible for someone to function would be a nervous breakdown.  This could be agoraphobia, panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder, even PTSD.  Sometimes I think even depression can be considered a nervous breakdown.  Probably pretty much any psychiatric condition as long as it stems from extreme stress.

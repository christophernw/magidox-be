don't run, the compression will make it worse- and if you opt for surgery(try not to) you may never run normally again.  to work the same muscles, if you are training for an event- try biking and most defninietely use the eliptoglider (that skiing/ arm thing) that sucker is non impact and will keep your thighs and calves ultimately powerful!!!. Rock on, marathon man!!. Try to cross-train by doing some laps- swimmers are some tough characters!

ok so this seems to be my case, i was 96 kgs by november last to last year. by the very next feb, i had reduced to 78 kgs, and now i am 66. well, i was 42 in my waist, now 32. so i would suggest the following things.. 1)jog. jog for atleast 30 min every morning. and walk atleast 20 min in the evening. evening-after dinner. important to exercise after dinner.. 2) drink a glass full of lemonade in after every excercise uv done. vitamin c is believed to relieve u of the excess fat.. 3) control ur diet. have only what ur body wants. do not, do not have any thing that ur body does not require.. 4) don't think that sugary things will affect you more than other things. the fact is that you should have watever you need, just excercise daily, without fail.. . these steps should see u loose all the fat you have.. take care,. good luck!

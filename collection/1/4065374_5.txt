Most believe your born again in this life but that's not what the bible teaches. In John 3 Jesus clearly says flesh & blood cannot enter the kingdom of heaven you must be born again. If your flesh & blood your not born again! To be born again you'll be spirit this happens at the resurection, when this mortal flesh & blood becomes imortal. Read 1st Cor. chapter 15. No where in the bible does it say we're immortal.

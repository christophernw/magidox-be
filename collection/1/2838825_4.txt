Hope you will read this and follow my logic.  I believe the Word or bible to be the Words of God and Jesus and Holy Spirit.  I try to live by them and when I fail, I go to them as prayer to my Father for forgivness because they say that if I do that, my sins He will not remember. My Father God says that He created the universe and He has created heaven for me to live in forever in a body which is immortal.  Father God is all powerful.  If He is not able to keep His Word pure enough for me to make it to heaven then He has no right to send me to hell with satan because He will not be just with me.  I will trust Him because He has never let me down, ever ever in all my long life. That is logically why I believe.

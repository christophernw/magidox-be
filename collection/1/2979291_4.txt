The same way we teach Pre-K or Kindergarten. Go through some Kindergarten teaching lessons and teach them from there-. I think the ABC's first. To get kids attention make it fun, musical, colorful, have them sing, color, draw, trace letters, and make sure you dont spend too much time on one subject. Dont forget they are KIDS who like to play and pretend and run and have fun

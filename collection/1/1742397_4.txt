Because of the weak interatomic forces, helium remains liquid down to absolute zero; helium solidifies only under great pressure. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5 K and about 26 standard atmospheres (2.6 MPa) of pressure. At sufficiently low temperature, both helium-3 and helium-4 undergo a transition to a superfluid phase. Superfluidity is a phase of matter characterised by the complete absence of viscosity (measure of the resistance of a fluid to deform under shear stress. It is commonly perceived as "thickness", or resistance to pouring). Thus superfluids, placed in a closed loop, can flow endlessly without friction.. . But getting a temperature of 1 - 1.5k is not possible outside of a laboratory, so in THEORY, it can roll uphill. Absolute Zero is not possible on earth, because of interaction between molecules in the atmosphere.

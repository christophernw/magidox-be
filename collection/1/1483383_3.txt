Is this actually documented that you have this? Have you spoken to your NAVY recruiter? You can still serve and be bipolar as long as it's not severe. You can't get rid of it but with therapy I have become a high functioning (no meds needed) bipolar, AND I was in the AF!! The career field I was in would have really surprised some so don't give up just yet

Have you never heard of countable and uncountable nouns?  (No sarcasm in that question.)  The basic rule for countable nouns is anything that you can easily see a single one of: eggs, trees, people; anything else is uncountable.. . Things that are too small to be counted individually (except for atoms) are deemed uncountable: rice, sand, and hair.

I was two years old. It was fall and my brother and I were playing in the leaves. My brother was only one. My mom was raking he leaves ino big piles, hen when she was done we would both jump into them. Then we pu them into giant pumpkin bags. I think a lot of people dont remember being a baby. But also, babys dont do much anyways. Sometimes I can remember almost bits and pieces of me being a baby, but the memory is never clear.

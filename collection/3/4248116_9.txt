I HONESTLY BELIEVE IT IS. IN ESSENCE ANYWAY. I BELIEVE WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY BEING DETURED, WE ARE BEING ASKED TO CHOOSE, SHOULD WE FIGHT ON OUR SOIL OR THEIRS? IT BECAME A SERIOUS TOPIC OF INTREST TO MANY AMERICANS, BECAUSE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE RESULTS EASIER HERE AT HOME. WHERE AS UNLESS YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO VISION WHAT THE POWERS THAT BE SEE, YOU TOO PROBABLY WILL SAY BUILD THE FENCES ON THE BOARDERS.... . MY SUGGESTION: ALLOW MEXICANS IN AMERICA, REGISTER THEM IN ONE OF TWO CATAGORIES... THE FIRST WOULD BE A NEW MILITARY BRANCH , SO WE CAN SEND THEM TO FIGHT OUR WARS. THE OTHER WOULD BE TO ALLOW THEM TO WORK OUR OIL REFINERIES, SO GAS WOULD BE CHEAPER.. . I SAY THIS JOKINGLY , BUT THAT WOULD SOLVE SOME PROBLEMS. BESIDES IF THEY LIVE HERE UNREGISTERED, THEY ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO A DRAFT SHOULD THERE EVER BE ANOTHER.... . FOOD FOR THOUGHT

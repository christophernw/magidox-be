It literally means "knowledge". A common misconseption is that Agnostic is some sort of middle ground between Atheist and Theist. The truth is that "agnostic" is just a general term, not related to religion. You can be agnostic about car engines if you've never seen one, you can be gnostic about a sport if you know it well, etc... . . Now, you can be an Agnostic Theist, where you believe that some "god" exists but you dont know the nature of that being. Or you can be an Agnostic Atheist, where you dont believe in a "god" because there is no way to know if there is one.. . Hope that helps.

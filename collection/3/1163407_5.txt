most photo editing software as a cropping tool...........  use it!  I can take any picture and crop it into another setting and make it look like it was an original and it's all done from the cropping tool in the photo editing software...................  try to find MGI Photo Editing Software from the internet and download it, it's wonderful and so easy to use..............

you may not be color blind.......there is  much  misundrstanding  in the fields  of  heriditary  characteristics....light  color  and  even  opaqness  are  manafestations  of  energy...sometimes  peoplke  develope  ways  of  seeing  and  doing  due to  environmental  adaptations....not  reasoning  that  it  is  seasoinal...try  useing  a brush  and  playing  at one  or two  colors,,,,watching  how they  mate....then  write  down or talk  about  yr  feelings...try it  again....you  will  notice a  variety  of  responses  that  you  didn't  know  were  included...but  you  will also  see  in  and  on  a  different  light......try b holding  yr  toes....relaxed  toes  help  the  head  and  neck  muscles  to  co-ordinate....and  give  rhythm  and  vitality  to  yr  brush.....the  graphic  part v vwill synchronize too

I figured that they seemed snobby to Americans because most Europeans don't have high opinions of Americans.  The English (that I've met) here (in Germany) for Football are very nice, but they may be just assuming that I too am German.  There is a possibility that it could be because they have such a rich history and so much pride in their country's historical standing, but I doubt it.   Most European cultures that I've dealt with also have higher standards in etiquette, like the way you eat, whether or not its okay to belch, etc. So, you may have inadvertently offended them.

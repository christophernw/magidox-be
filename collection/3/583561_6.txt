It's complete bullsh*t and needs to be taken out!! balck kids with LOW SAT's are getting into amazing colleges while white kids with way HIGHER scores are getting rejected, all based on race! . I'm sorry, but that's pure racism! If we're all equal, shouldn't we all have the same rights and benefits? As in, black people should not have any extra help from the govt!!!

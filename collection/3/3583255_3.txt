A servo Amplifier  is a fancy name for a motor driver printed circuit.  The circuit is used to turn a stepping motor(servo) like a robots arm, can move at any almost any position up and down or in-between. The signal to the amplifier tells the motor how many steps to take (motor has many small increments as it turns, and you can stop at any one of them. The servo amplifier (motor driver PCB) is not really amplifying audio nor would it be good for that purpose. It is merely used to convert a small control signal to a larger one. One that can output enough current to step the motor. The stepping is done by the combinations of the switching between the leads (say four) like A and -A and B and -B. basically reversing the polarity or not reversing it to make it go forward one step or in reverse.  If the signal is a one step at a time. If you send a frequency to the input of 2 Hz (thats how many times a button is pushed for one second) the stepping motor will continue to step 2 steps a second until you stop it. The servo motor might have 120 steps for one revolution.  You can buy them with different steps. Also these devices the servos and amplifiers are used for alot of things, including toy airplanes for precision control, even in copiers for precision movement of the rollers for different size of paper.

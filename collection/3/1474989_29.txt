God has only given us an incomplete Creation.  He does not particularly "take" anyone.  The Bible says that God is no respector of persons, meaning He does not choose. Incomplete so we will find our Purpose and work to fulfill it.  God made the world good; all six times He said "It is good."  Humans can use God's Creation or abuse it.  Unfortunately, we sinned.. . We are the ones who need to learn.  We need to do our part to make the world get back to good.

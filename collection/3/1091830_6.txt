As someone said ... funerals are for those that have lived. By living we mean that breaths have been taken. It is also easier on the parents as this is a very difficult time for them. They dont need the headaches, heart aches that come from funerals. Also people must think of the expense of a funeral for a miscarriage of as asked... a 1 week old fetus....this is really just a collection of cells....there is no brain, organs, blood...How can you say that you would put parents through all this for something that has no idea that it exists.

My sympathy to you for your loss. Be honest with your landlord, he/she may be able to work with you if you can provide that you are truthful about your paying your due. Do not continue to to get behind in your rent. If there is no way out (being able to afford to continue to live there @ the current rent rate), ask if there are some work you can do for the landlord around the building in return for a discount in the rental rate. Cut the grass, wash windows...something. Be sure not to do work that would put you at risk for injury. If you do, then make sure the landlord has insurance in case something does happen.

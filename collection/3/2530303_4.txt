It's important to consider the fact that not everyone feels life begins at the same point.  Many people don't consider the fetus a human because for awhile it is simply a bundle of cells, and nothing else.  For many, including myself, more is required to consider the fetus a living thing.. And as far as reasons for abortion...I don't think it's fair to make the judgement call of whether or not women should HAVE an abortion.  There are many reasons that women feel abortions are the best decisions, and I have to imagine that a woman knows what's best for her.. In many situations, women decide abortion is the best decision because they know they will be unable to care for a child.  I've worked with enough unwanted children to appreciate how good of a decision it is to not have a child if you are not prepared.. On the far end of the unfortunate spectrum, women often become pregnant as a result of rape.  I don't feel it is fair to force a woman to carry a reminder of such a terrible trauma with her for nine months, unless she feels she is emotionally strong enough to handle that.  Many women aren't.. I am strongly pro-choice, and strongly believe that every woman has the right to choose what is best for them.  And I don't think it's fair to make judgements without being in the shoes of the woman making the tough decision.

I had 2 white cats and I dyed one of them green for St Patty's Day and the only thing you could use is food coloring.They will lick at it all the time tell it comes off .I did it very lightly by only putting a small bit in and brushing it all through.So it wasn't like green green it was faded pastel.Had alot of comments about it as most people liked it.

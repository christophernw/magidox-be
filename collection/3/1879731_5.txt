water is slightly acidic so when it rains the water goes into the ground and if there is a cave made of limestone(calcium carbonate),which is an extremely weak type of rock, then the acid will break it down and take the calcium with it.as it drips into the cave, it forms a calcium deposit on the ceiling.After hundreds, or thousands of years, they grow and some connect with stalagmites to form columns.

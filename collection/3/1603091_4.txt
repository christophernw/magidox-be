Christians really need to find a way to have their faith, but also accept the fact that scientific facts have proof, faith is merely faith.  . . It's difficult to argue with a person who has been conditioned since birth to believe something, just for the sake of believing, with no proof, in fact, proof that contradicts faith.  . . You can still be a good, honest, giving and decent person without believing the evangelism.  If you want to have your faith, have it, but don't condemn those who read, use and understand scientific facts.

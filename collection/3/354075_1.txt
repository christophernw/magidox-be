your question is totally rude and uncalled for.  i take it you're skinny?  :(. . not being a military wife myself, i can only imagine the stress of those who have loved ones in the military right now, especially overseas.  food is a comfort to many people, and those who are depressed are more prone to gaining weight.. . please do a little research or take time to re-think your shallow judgement before you blast someone for being overweight.

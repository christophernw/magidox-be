I wish this was about opinions but it more about statistics. These show that the main problem is Mexico's economy which is very unstable. Secondly, the high unemployment rate makes wages extremely low and the supply much greater than the demand. Education has become an increasing factor, requiring a high school education which is very difficult to obtain when poverty makes their children have to work as early as 7 yrs. old at "legal slavery" jobs in order to eat. Immigration to the cities have caused an imbalance on both school capacity as well as job opportunities. The political party change in this country has caused incoherence and confusion. The three parties that are fighting for power for the Presidency this coming July are spending millions of dlls on their campaigns. The political system they have is totally corrupted and people now feel there is little hope for any true change.

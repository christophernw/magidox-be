I'm assuming you are referring to why people don't take care of the Earth:. . They are very selfish; too busy to care about this Earth that we've actually BORROWED from our GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN.. Hope the Earth is still there for THEM.. . Don't forget though, that many environmental groups who do care are around.  Earth Day is one that millions are involved in.  You might want to join an advocacy group to save our planet.

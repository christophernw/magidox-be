I assume you meant "how to finD prospective customers". . depending on your business. think about your typical customers. who they are, what do they do when they want to find your service/products. . . what kind of services/products relate to yours, perhaps you can do join marketing with those other companies. . . put adds in local newspaper /media, you have to place your ads where people read/watch to find/buy your products/services. . . anyway, it would be more helpful if you could be more specific.

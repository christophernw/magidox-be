I don't think he meant it that way....i don't think it was an attack on our military as much as it's a way to motivate the slackers in the country.  The Army & College are both better options then street gangs and what-not.. . Haven't you ever let words slip out before using your head and arranging them correctly?  I know I have and ended up sticking my foot in my mouth when something came out sounding way different then I intended it to mean....good thing I'm not in polotics ;)

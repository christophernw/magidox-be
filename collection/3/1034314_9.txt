In my experience, about 1/2 of the boys you think are gay in high school wind up actually being gay later in life. . . I not assuming you are in high school, but high school is not really a good indication of sexual preferance. Many kids before establishing themselves on their own in college or at least out of their parents house feel tons of external pressures to be "straight". These kids may not realize that being gay is not something to be ashamed of thanks to years of teasing from other kids about being gay. . . The other 1/2 of the "sissy" kids or the ones that don't seem to interact with girls etc may just be a little less socially confident. Many kids just haven't learned how to talk to the opposite sex. That doesn't make you gay, so remember that by no means are all shy or soft spoken boys gay.. . On top of that, some boys try so hard NOT to be gay in high school that they act ultra masculine and manage to carry on several relationships with women. These boys may even be reputed to be good lovers, may engage in sports and other masculine activities so that they won't be percieved gay. These kids may never accept their sexuality or maybe they will.. . Anyway to better answer the question, it is probably impossible to tell which kids are CURRENTLY gay. If you are just curious because you are curious, don't worry about it. If you are trying to say...set up your gay friend on a date, you might have some issues there. I think its likely your school has some sort of gay/lesbian club on campus, and if it is your intention to meet gay boys, you could probably find a few there.

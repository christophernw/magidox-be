Let me tell you something, I am a white woman and I love black men, I think black men (and women too) are sexier than white people, so you just can't generalize!!!.. . I have many black friends (men and women).. . I know that racism exists, but not only toward black people.  For example I am Latin and I know that many Americans hate Latinos, however I'm not suffering because of that.. . I don't agree with racism, but I guess that it exists in every country.

Well now, if he'd "saved himself from the cross" what would the Christians base their religion on?  Oh, wait, if he hadn't died on the cross there wouldn't be any Christians. It was fortunate that he did.  Well, fortunate for them, not an uplifting experience for him.  No, that's not right. The Christians maintain that it was an uplifting experience for him, so what's all the fuss about?. Say, and all this stuff about giving your son up to be tortured .... isn't that child abuse.  Wouldn't that make this case one of the first documented cases of child abuse?  And, wouldn't that mean that G-d, in his wisdom, condones child abuse?  No, wouldn't it mean that he espouses child abuse?  Would that not lead to the conclusion that all Christians should abuse their children, or someone else's?  Just a thought!

I have some really good suggestion for you. The flu I can not solve. It is something you need to give time do what ever it does normally. But you can help the child in passing the time in a better way . To cure the nasal you can do one of the two (or both if you like). 1. Take onion juice and put it near its head for the night it will clear the nasal . 2. Take a 0.5 spoon of salt inside one glass of water and put 6 drops in its nose every hour. that will help also

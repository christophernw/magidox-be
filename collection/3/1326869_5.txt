Basically, the world we live in provides us with evidence as to how it came to be this way. The evolution theory is established scientific fact - it is generally accepted among those who study the world we live in that humans evolved from animals. We have found fossils that document the changing human form, from ape to man. Evolution is a continuing process - it did not simply happen and then stop. Humans are still adapting to their changing environment - we are much taller now than we were only a few centuries ago.

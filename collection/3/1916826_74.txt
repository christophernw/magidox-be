Dogs often bark at shadows of moving things, like tree or plant leaves. Sometimes these shadows are cast on the ceiling for brief periods when the wind/lighting are right. One of my dogs barked at tree leaves while seeing them against the full moon. I think she imagined it was the squirrels she could see in daytime in those trees.. . I had a Beagle that barked at moths that were on the ceiling. It took me quite awhile to find out what caused this barking.. . One time a business closed nearby and many mice invaded my house. My dog did that shaking 24/7 until I exterminated the mice.. Good luck in finding the source.

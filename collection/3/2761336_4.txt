the problem is you`re probably Romanian (right?) and you don`t know how to translate te word into English. annexite is a disease that basically means the inflammation of the oviducts (asta inseamna imflamatia trompelor uterine in caz ca nu intelegi) and of the ovaries due to an infection. it`s a gynecological problem and it can lead to bigger problems like sterility if it`s not treated on time.

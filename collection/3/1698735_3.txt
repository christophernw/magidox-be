Since people use the color black as a general racist term for African Americans it is to be believed that you are saying a joke about an unintelligent person based on her hair color may as well be an insult to an entire race of people it is soooo demeaning. This has got to be the most racist, hateful, ridiculous analogy that I have seen in my life!  You have spoken volumes about what your beliefs are. Dumb blond jokes are not remotely racist!!!

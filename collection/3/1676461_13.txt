The world won't end.  . You have probably limited your options for next fall but you aren't completely screwed.  The most competitive colleges probably aren't an option for fall 2007 but you could take a year off or go to a less competitive university and consider transferring to a more competitive school later (and hopefully have decent grades to show what you are capable of doing in college).  There are many "less competitive" schools which will still be accepting students for a while but where you can still get a very good education.  It isn't always necessary to shoot for a famous school.  If you are like many students, you may be procrastinating because you still don't feel certain of what you want to pursue and the kind of school where you would feel comfortable.  It's time to do some serious thinking now- but know that most students will change their mind somewhere along the way anyway.  Your choice doesn't need to be set in concrete. . Good luck.

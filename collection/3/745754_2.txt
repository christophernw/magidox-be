That depends. Unless your unit is confined to post, go to the 1st sergeant and ask for a weekend pass.  If he gives you the pass, it will have the time you need to report back to post.  Don't be late.. . 1) If you have a buddy with connections, try to get a ride into town or wherever the group wants to go (within reason).. . 2) If you have no connections, hitch hike to town and go see the local sights.  (Ex. from Fort Dix you are within sightseeing distance of Atlantic City, NJ or NYC or Philly.  Independence Hall / liberty bell etc.. . 3) Join a community swim club and hang out with the locals.  It's a good way to get away from the Army for a while.. . 4) If all else fails, grab a book and get off post.  I used to walk a few miles to the community cemetery and lean against a handy tombstone while reading my book or just lay back in the grass and study cloud formations.. . The main thing here is to GET off the post!  If you hang around the barracks or goof off where the NCOs can see you, you are going to be placed on every weekend detail that arises.  Everybody else has a weekend off and you haul trash or sort clothes in a green building in the back of the area.  They'll also nab you if you come back to eat in the chow line.  Buy yourself a burger in town.. . Johnny

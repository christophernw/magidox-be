even i dont understand this entire religion thing...if we wudnt have been divided into religions then world wud have been a better place to live in...with every religion trying to prove itself better than the other, we have even lost our basic human principals like kindness, forgiveness, etc. We are ready to kill each other for it but where the hell does any religion asks its followers to kill each other for it...will any of these religious people explain this...all these people who make an issue out of it are not even worth belonging 2 any religion.... well honestly i am not the kinds who'll just go blah blah blah about my religion but i just respect others as individuals...& when i have children, i'll try my best 2 make them good human beings & not segregate people into religions...

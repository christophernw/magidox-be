Do not overbathe! Some people bathe their dogs too much, also if you use shampoos for fleas etc especially on pups will give it a dandruff problem. With the brushing and adding oil to my dogs diet I bought some vit E oil and coated my dogs skin in it every other day for a week, then just did a rinse with a babys shampoo after a week, my problem was solved

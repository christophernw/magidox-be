There's a machine at the gym where you start out sitting, with your legs apart, and there are pads on the inside of your knee and calf, and you press your legs together. That'll work your inner thighs. If you don't have a gym, go to a sporting goods store and buy a tool (forget what it's called) that looks like a V with a hinge in the bottom, and you can do that at home while watching TV by just putting the V between your legs and pressing them together.. . Don't forget to stretch before and after or you'll lose flexibility!

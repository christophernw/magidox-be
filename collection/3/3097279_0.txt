$700 is a major ripoff. Here's the breakdown on what it should cost: Decent front pads or shoes, about 30 bucks. Decent rear pads or shoes, about 30 bucks. Resurface rotors or drums if they need it, about ten bucks each. If they need to be replaced, they shouldn't be more than about 50 bucks. Even if you have the brakes done at a shop, it shouldn't be more than $300 if they just have to replace the pads or shoes and resurface the discs or drums.

Its a good way to get money fast for a big purchase. My advice would be to go for one which offers 0% interest on balance transfers for the longest time - some are around 9-12 mths. Once the 0% time nearly runs out, if you have not yet cleared the debt, transfer to another credit card company that offers 0% and pay off your existing credit card balance with it. That way you wont have to pay interest. Dont go mad with the credit card though. I would only use mine in an emergency or for a large purchase I would not use it for retail therapy !

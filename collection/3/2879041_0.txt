There are two reasons:  1) as said above, there is a large difference in the electronegativities of oxygen and hydrogen - this pulls the electrons more towards the oxygen atom and results in an unequal charge distribution, and 2) geometry - the angle made by H-O-H is not linear, so the differences in the charge distribution don't cancel each other out.  Compare carbon dioxide, which IS linear.  It's a lot less polar.

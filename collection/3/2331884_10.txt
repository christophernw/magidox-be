When you smile you feel better then when your frowning. Also when you smile, you could make someone else smile. A smile can be a miracle. You could be walking down the street and you see a stranger; they may be having the worst day and your smile could brighten their day. Amazing something that takes such little effort could change the way you feel and others.

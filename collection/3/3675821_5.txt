That is why there is a separation of powers and laws between the Federal and the States. The Federal can impose law on the States, but only after the Representatives of every state agree and vote in a majority, This is called The Democratic Process. The Republic is the many States that together form a Nation. We are under or have accepted a Democratic Republic as the law of the land. In this system, elected Representatives cast votes, these votes are to be cast with the approval of the majority of voters in that Representatives district. If 6 people write to or contact a Representative and tell them Vote NO, then 12 citizens contact the representative and tell them Vote YES, the Representative is required, by law, to vote with the Majority of the Citizens that they serve. . Can a vote be purchased, certainly. . Can a vote be swayed by a lobbyist, certainly.. Is this the same Free and Democratic Republic that was envisioned in the Original Constitution, no it is not. . Is it better to live in an almost free America than someplace else. I do not know, I cannot leave this Country. . Would I want to leave this country if I was able to, I have no idea, but more than likely no.. Am I poor, I am below the poverty level, but I have indoor plumbing and an internet connection. . Allways look on the bright side of life.

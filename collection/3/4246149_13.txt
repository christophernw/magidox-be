I love how conservatives re-write history.  THERE WAS A SURPLUS.   I know you'd like to pretend that the current present has the slightest clue about econmics.  But I think the results speak for themselves.. . The only "experts" who think the economy is strong work at or for the white house.  It's luke warm at best and frankly we're lucky that it's even that.. . If we're going to deficit spend lets do it on something that helps americans.  Bush just got another 80 billion for the war.  . . Do you have any idea what 80 billion would do for the education system in this country?

Today, Arabic and Hebrew sound similar (for me as an Arab). Thousands of years ago, when Arabs & Hebrews were closer to their shared roots, their languages were more similar I guess. So, Elohim & Allah might be one word with 2 different spellings.. . During Noah's times, we all spoke the same language. So, if descendants of Ham who lived in the Middle East speak same language as their cousins, descendants of Shem who lived in the same area (Middle East), I think it's ok.

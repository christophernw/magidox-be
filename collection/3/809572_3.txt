it the system of veins, arteries and cpillaries that carry blood around the body. the heart is the center of it all that gives the blood most of its pressure to move. then you have a lymphatic system that is closely linked to the circulatory system but has very little to do with the heart.. the circulatory system is divided into two sub-sections, the veinal system and the arteriole system. arteries take oxygenated blood away from the heart and veins take de-oxygenated blood to the heart. be carefull though the pulmonary artery takes oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart and the pulmonary vein takes de-oxygenated blood to the lungs and waya from the heart.

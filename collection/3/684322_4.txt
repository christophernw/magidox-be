Do you mean why others treat differently (with less respect, maybe) the people who haven't managed to suceed? Well, that's because they have always considered success to be the most important thing in life. However, once got there they need to be reminded of it every day. So, what do they do? They treat less successful people as rubbish merely to confirm their superiority. In my opinion, success is relevant. Assume for example, that you have just finished law school. You are very clever, indeed, but, you just don't want to spend the rest of your life acquitting criminals. You just wish to live a peaceful life in the country breeding sheep. Is this failure? It's not that you CAN'T go to court and start lying to people; you just DON'T WANT to, because something like that, would be against your moral sense. And that my friend, is the difference between failure and conscious choice. Hope this helps. Take care.

You need to talk to your teachers at this point and explain yourself (i.e. why are you 2 months behind).  If you really are motivated and want to do the work, try to work out a deal with them to catch up and then stick to your committment.  Some teachers are willing to give people second chances (or 3rd and 4th and 5th chances if they're sincere about their desire to do the work).

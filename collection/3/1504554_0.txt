If you know he's at NKSP, you can call the prison directly and get his current housing information (661) 721-2345, ask for the Records department.. The Inmate Locater number is usually really busy during the day, your best bet is to call after 6 pm or before 8 am.. If the Inmate Locater Service tell you he's been transferred, here's a link to all CDCR facilities... same deal, once you know where he is, call that prison for current info.. Good luck!

It sounds like your blood sugar level is playing games with you.If this is the case,then you need to change your diet and eating habbits.You need to avoid potatoes and bread products.You also need to eat small portions during meals and have snacks between the meals.For your meals,eat baked,broiled or steamed meat and avoid frying foods,eat green leafy vegtables or carrots uncooked or steamed.If you desire,have a light desert such as a bowl of jello or a small portion of bannana pudding or cobbler.As for your in between snacks,have something like a glass of milk and a bag of peanuts,a beef jerky stick,fruit or anything that is high in protein.Just remember high protein foods,no sugar or minimum sugar and avoid anything that contains startch(this automatically turns to sugar).If you desire something sweet,try eating natural fruit such as a sweet apple,peach,plum,an orange,or berries.Fruits make their own sweetness which will not raise or lower your blood sugar level.If this diet does not improve your problems or you start experiencing any other symptoms such as dizziness or you feel like you are going to faint then I would suggest seeing a doctor as soon as possible because it could be more serious than correcting your diet.I use to pass out after eating and then it got worse,I would black out while driving and luckily someone else was with me each time.I saw my doctor and he changed my diet and it has been over 8 years since I have had a problem ater changes.. . Good luck

think about it like this.... . GENERALLY, a fat person is fat because they eat to much and are lazy. people who arent fat GENERALLY exercise and control themselves when it comes to food. . . so why should people who dont take care of themselves be treated the same way as someone who does care. So, in my opinion, fat people dont deserve as much respect.. . . judging by the second part of your question, ill assume that that has happended to you, but in reality it probably rarely happens.

The last part "the only time people get what they pray for is when it would have happened anyway in the natural course of events" is perfect. Irrefutable. . Now every prayer is potential, and does have the fulfilling energy. But generally, there is an accompanying counter thought 'will it happen? ' and this neutralises the potential. Also, is it not possible that many people have already prayed to allow natural course of events to happen (since they felt that nature is a better judge than all people's minds put together !)? Then even logically, it follows that such bulk prayers get priority, and ought to be fulfilled. Many renowned thinkers have spent lots of time and sincere efforts and have loosely termed the process as Universal Mind or so. A very vague term but close to real possibility. The question itself is truly a thought provoking one. It is worth looking at this question more than once, within, for it can open possibilities to awareness of deeper levels of consciousness !

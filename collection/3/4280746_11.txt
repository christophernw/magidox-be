Religion has many forms.  Some have a God.  Some do not.  But all have underlying philosophies that are similar or essentially the same.  The only way to destroy religion is to destroy mankind.  All people have beliefs.  None can be proven or disproven.  You have your beliefs and I have mine.  You have your religion and I have mine.  You have your church and I have mine.  You have chosen to stand up here in your congregation of bloggers and "put your beliefs on others." and insult those that disagree with you.  Are you any different than they are?. . Religion isn't just some big con put on to steal people's money and gain power, though some religious leaders have been guilty of such.  Religion consists of the philosophies handed down from generation to generation intended to help people deal with everyday trials and prepare for ultimate death.. . Some of it will prove to be "bullshit" someday, but not all of it.  Nevertheless, you can find great wisdom from these religions and philosophies that benefit you and your family everyday if you'll just take the time to study them.  Unless its against your religion...

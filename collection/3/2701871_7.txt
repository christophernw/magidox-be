Don't worry I just did the research and there is nothing you really expected of you.  What happens is... you go into a room with your boss and she gives you a variety of drugs and depending on how you respond to each drug, she determines which drug she going to be using for recreational purposes.  In other words, she's using you as her guinea pig.  This is normal and if you pass she will continue to test you on any future drugs.  Good Luck!

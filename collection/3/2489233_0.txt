Poverty works. I got divorced while still in the Navy many years ago. After making the mandated child support payment, I could only afford to eat at the mess hall for breakfast (the cheapest meal). So I got one meal a day. I could eat all I wanted of anything, and I did - I stuffed myself on bacon, sausage, pancakes, fruit, milk, eggs, toast - whatever. One meal a day.. . Oh, and also, I was doing light work all day in an unheated warehouse in November/December in southern Virginia, so just keeping warm was probably sucking up some calories.. . I went from a 34 waist to a 29 inside of 2 months. I forget the poundage, but that sounds like it might have been 20 pounds or more.. . At one point, I also tried a protein diet to see what that would be like. Just meat (mostly lean), some greens, non-carb-heavy veggies, a little fruit, no grains, no pasta. I lost 20 pounds in about a month. It was a little tough though.. . Yes, either way is unhealthy.

The Shengen Treaty provides that all visas acquired in an EU country are Shengen-type visas, allowing movement between all EU members. But it doesn’t apply to work permits if you are a non-EU citizen. The Shengen Treaty was mostly designed for current EU citizens, it didn’t really take foreigners into special consideration. I wish there were a kind of Shengen Visa and I wish I had one!

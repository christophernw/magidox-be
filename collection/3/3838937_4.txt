There's alot of things that can cause hemorroids, constipation, cronic diarrhea,foods you eat and sitting for long periods of time. Pregnancy also can be reason especially during labor.  For short term relief try a cream or sitz bath, but surgery is the only way to get rid of them, which should be the last resort, because I've been told the surgery is very painful.

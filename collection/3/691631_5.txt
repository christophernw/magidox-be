I would suggest that the anxiety and stress is causing you to sleep a lot.... when my body is stressed i find it tries to shut down. To possibly relieve some stress, make you sleep better and slowly get you back in to a good routine I would strongly suggest exercise. It will stimulate your body, work out any stress and release 'happy hormones' into you body. So even if its running up and down your stairs, or a quick jog around your block a few time, or even dancing around your room... it might help.#. Good luck

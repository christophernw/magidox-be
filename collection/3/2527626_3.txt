I would venture to say that you have scorred a cylinder wall.  Basically, the rings are melted to the piston and scraped up the wall.  Usually on one side of the cylinder wall.  Piston is probably trash too.  Save yourself the time and frustration and buy a long block and swap the engine.  Or you can visit the junkyard for a motor.  Good luck...sorry for your troubles.

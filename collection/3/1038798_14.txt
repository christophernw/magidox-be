They're not.  Both the executive branch and the legislative branch are currently being controlled by Republicans.  If anything, this country is being ruined by spoiled children and greedy people.   Gas companies are receiving record profits while gas prices continue to rise, all the while environmental standards are being lowered which increases the likelihood of detrimental environmental effects like global warming.  And then there's the pretentious posturing around nuclear weapons.  I would say the Republicans are in the lead in lying and making mistakes, but that's just an opinion, since you asked.  Oh yeah, then there's the weapons of mass destruction fiasco, illegal wiretapping.. don't get me started!  Why do people have such short memories these days?

Well that's not exactly correct: Atomic radius decreases in the same period of the periodic table as we go from left to right, so it decreases even though the mass number increases. That is because the heavier atom has more protons in nucleus that exert stronger forces to the electrons of the outer shell.. . But the radius increases in the same group as we go from top to bottom, so a heavier atom has a bigger radius.

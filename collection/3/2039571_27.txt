Start saving money, I thought  I was hopeless but now I enjoy looking at the account grow instead of decrease. . . I also check my account and see where my money goes and try to think of ways to cut costs. . . But I think number one is get a hobby that is free like Yahoo Answeres or volunteer at something that appeals to you like scouts, the food bank or Salvation Army. You may be validating yourself or entertaining yourself through shopping so find something fun that doesnt cost money instead.. . Have fun!

My sister had the same problem in her neighborhood.  When someone saw the intruder in his or her back yard, they would chase the criminal.  No one caught him this way.  In fact, that was outright dangerous.  I told her to hold a neighborhood meeting and come up with a plan.  The stalker liked to sit in a lawn chair and stair through windows.  I told her to just call the police and let them handle it.  Plan where he might run, and let the police set up a small sting operation.  In the end, it didn't work.  However, he was caught in a different state and  arrested for something there.

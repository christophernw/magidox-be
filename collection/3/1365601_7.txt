Have you tried chai? It is spiced black or green tea with milk. There are many good blends on the market, or you can brew your own. (I use a blend of cinnamon, honey, cardamom, black pepper, nutmeg, and clove powder in VERY small amounts) You might like that. . . Also try some of the Bigelow flavored teas (vanilla caramel and raspberry are two of my favorites). . . It is also possible that you do not have the right balance of taste buds to like it. I was really surprised to learn that my strong aversion to the taste of grapefruit, alcohol, coffee, and cloyingly sweet things is due to my having 3x the number of taste buds as an average person! Research is finding that some people have more receptors of one or two kinds, or significantly less, and therefore do not stimulated the same way by different tastes.

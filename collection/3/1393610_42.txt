hoover hoped the gov't would regrow by itself.. . FDR increased government spending in large gov't projects that hired millions to work on consturction projects such as long road developments and ect.. . WWII got us out of the Depression becuase more people joined the military cuasing employment to go up. the spirit of the nation improved cuasing those in factories to work harder and unhumanable hours. those that came home after the war had work ethic and were easily hired becuase of patriatism of the employers.

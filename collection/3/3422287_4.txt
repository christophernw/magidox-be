Walk into the bank and ask to talk with the credit card department.  Hopefully you have a savings account with say $300 in it.  Offer to use this amount as collateral.  This means that they can hold this money as insurance for your credit card purchases.  Charge stuff, and pay off the balance before the first month.  This will ensure that you are not charged interest.  But, more importantly, you will establish a track record of paying off your bills.. . Then, after 6 months, get a free credit report from one of the 3 credit bureaus, experian.com, transfax.com, or transunion.com and see what your credit rating is.  Then, try to get a small loan from that bank citing your payments that have been on time.

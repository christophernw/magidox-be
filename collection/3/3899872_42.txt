There really is no answer to your question because every time you cook Spaghetti the actual cooking time will be slightly different.. . The only way I know of telling when Spaghetti is done is what's called "Al Dente" literally, "To the Tooth".  When the spaghetti is about done, you begin tasting a couple of noodles until it "feels about right" to you tongue... when that happens get it off the fire, drain and add the sauce... most professional cooks don't cool the spaghetti with cold water because it takes that starch residue off which makes the sauce stick better to the noodles.

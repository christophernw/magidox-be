By using spectra. Each element has characteristic frequencies of light that it emits or absorbs. If light from the star is spread out into a spectrum (like a rainbow), there will be dark lines for absorbtion and bright lines for emission. By identifying the chemicals that correspond to those lines, we deduce the composition of the star.

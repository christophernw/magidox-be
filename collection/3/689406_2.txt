you might also try buying fresher onions...they get more potent as they get older.  Cutting under running water helps if you are only cutting them in half or other large cuts...you can't mince an onion under running water.  You might also try doing it by a window, try to air out the room a bit.  Last but not least forget the onions and go get some shallots...they usually don't hurt your eyes as much and have a wonderful flavor.

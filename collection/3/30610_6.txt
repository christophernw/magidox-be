Cost. Nothing more.. The cost of sending a manned mission to Mars is the ONLY reason we haven't been there yet. Humans could easily be there and establish a base on Mars in less than 5 years.. In fact, if 15% of the money wasted on the war in Iraq, had been spent on such a project, it's estimated that there would be a team on Mars already.. Speaks volumes for Bush's priorites don't you think?

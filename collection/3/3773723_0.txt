I would think, for Jews, there is sufficient reason to be Jewish, and not sufficient reason to be Christian.  Part of the sufficient reason to be Jewish is being born into it (for most Jews) and believing in one God, rather than the metaphorical, hypothetical, and mystical Trinity.  The reasons you mentioned certainly contribute to wanting to keep to the Jewish community.

I use the terms basically interchangeable, although "ethics" seems to me to be somewhat more economic/political/business in nature.  "Morals" seems to be somehow more tied into social structures like relationships.  I also try to use the word "ethics" when discussing the topic with someone religious, as I am an atheist and many religious people think that one can only be moral if they believe in a god/s.

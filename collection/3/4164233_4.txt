Getting rid of money, on its own would mean moving back to bartering as said above, however regarding your idea you are, i believe absolutely correct. Why should we have to pay for food that we NEED to live, and medicine to keep us alive. In any decent, humane and rational society it would be obvious that you cannot put a price on human existence. Capitalism however puts us all up for sale as we must sell our strengths and skills to earn a right to survive....A right to live. . . Getting rid of money in its own right would not stop us having to labour, as the people own our places of work, our bosses etc would merely wish to accumulate wealth in another form, be that knitted jumpers or goats...this is the cycle of capitalism. The wealth, as it is at the moment, would be created by the people who work and kept by those who don't. When money is involved the goods are merely exchanged for a universal currency called MONEY, getting rid of money would not stop this it would just mean a change in the commodity that is stored as wealth.. . The fall of capitalism is the only thing that will create the kind of world you are discussing, and there are people  fighting for that in their everyday lives.

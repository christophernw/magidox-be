You need muscles in the intestines to continue the peristalsis through the digestive tract.  Just like the muscles in your esophagus move a food bolus to the stomach, the muscles in your intestines move the bolus out of the body.  Without muscles, the food would sit there until it either was pushed out by other food or burst the intestine.  Yikes!

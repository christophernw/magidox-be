It's more efficient.  The beat of the birds wing causes airflow that can be utilized by the bird behind it and use less energy to stay aloft.. . The bird at the very front of the formation expends the most energy because it has to generate all it's lift from it's own wings.. . Next time you get a chance, watch a formation of geese, ducks, etc...Notice that the lead bird will drop back in the V and another bird will take over the lead.  Being the lead bird is (I suppose) very tiring.

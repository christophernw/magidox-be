i dont know if you can ever stop loving someone that you loved at one time in your life.. i've had many experiences in my short life - my father abused my mother physically and emotionally, just as he did to my sister and i.  there were other types of abuses involved as well.  i love my father.  my mother loves him as well.  they were divorced from each other one time and now they are remarried and still have a terrible relationship - sans the physical abuse.  . if you've been broken hearted its hard to get over that as well - i never did.  my first boyfriend broke my heart, which was 14 years ago and i think about him often.  i know i still love him but i also know that loving him does not prevent me from loving someone else nor does it prevent me from living my life.  there's always someone out there for you and they can at least take your mind off of it for a time.

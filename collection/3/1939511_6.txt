Health and safety laws. With any execution if you were to survive you are able to walk free. Like the law you can't be tried for the same offence you can't be executed twice for the same crime. If the needle isn't sterilised and you survive you could sue. This happened to my mate Harry. He died from an infection he received form the needle after he survived his execution sadly before he had time to litigate. He could have been on to a nice little earner

The Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights and its counter part, Aurora Australis in the southern hemisphere is a phenomenon created from a set of complex interactions between the Earth’s and Sun’s magnetic fields, in conjunction with the passage of photons emitted by the Sun through the Earth’s gravitational sphere of influence. Photons and other high-energy particles are refracted downward by Earth’s gravity as they transverse through its magnetic field with concentrated energy flows at the poles.

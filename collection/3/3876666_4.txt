Is the cockatail like biting hard enough to draw blood?? Or is it just sorta pecking with it's mouth open?? if it's biting hard it might becuase he/she has some agression towards you. If he's pecking at you with an open mouth He's probaly just playing with you. Try getting some toys, avoid mirrors!!!

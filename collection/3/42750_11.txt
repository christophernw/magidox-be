The reason why we need to be born again is-just like you were born into this earth into your family, you need to become "born again" into the family of God. Meaning your SPIRIT needs to be born again, from being a sinner-someone who doesn't know God, to someone who does-by being born again. You also need to be born again to enter into heaven, cause it is not based on works done here on earth, but we are "saved or "born again" by grace-unearned favor, thru grace.

Because alot of gas stations like 7-11 and Citgo's do a mimi-market analasys.  Usually a manager will often drive around to the nearest gas stations and report the prices to a corperate location which will respond with a daily price. I worked for the Pantry, Inc. which owns many gas stations in the South East and that is theor exact method of deteminating prices.

I'm not sure..I'm just here to say that my friend elected to not circumcise her son...and when he was nearly one year old he had to have it done...which was waaaaaay worse than if she had done it when he was an infant. He was getting infections up under the skin and rashes. Now I know others who have circumcised their sons and they all say it is for hygiene purposes and appearance.

Hi.  I think a wholesaler buys tickets in bulk quantities from airlines or other consolidators and sells them for a discount.  A retailer is like a travel agency.  They deal in small quantities.  For example.  A wholesaler may buy 50 seats on a flight to India.  These are bought at heavy discount, some of which is passed on to travelers.  A travel agency buys as customers require.  Hope this helps.

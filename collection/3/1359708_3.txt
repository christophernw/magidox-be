playing soccer as a goale i got hit with the ball on my right pinky . . it hurt soo bad an swelled so much . . the swelling did die down after a while and had it Xrayed apparently the bone near the jiont got ibjured and now dosnt fit 100% into the socket . meaning it wont bend all the way like it used too.. . if you cant bend yours at all or its movment is very limited go see a docter and chek it out .. . Good Luck

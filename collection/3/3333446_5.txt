I'd be concerned that there is a problem that might effect you (aside from se...ual frustration).  I would discuss it with him point blank, but NOT IN THE BEDROOM.  Make it an, "I'm concerned about your health..." talk instead of the "You've got a problem that you need to recognize" talk.  This will help him to realize that you actually care about "him" and not just "it."

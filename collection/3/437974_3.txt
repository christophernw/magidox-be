A hydrocarbon is a carbon based molecule with hydrogens attached to the outer bonds for carbon.  Hydrocarbons can contain other elements - such as oxygen, nitrogen or halogens.  These additions add functionality to the molecule.  For instance, ethyl alcohol (ethanol) is a hydrocarbon with 2 C, 5 H and the -OH group.  The -OH group makes in an alcohol.  Carbon can make single, double and triple bonds, so hydrocarbons with the same number of carbons may have different numbers of hydrogens - for instance - the hydrocarbon with 2 C 6 H has the carbons attached by a single bond (ethane).  The hydrocarbon with 2 C and 4 H has the carbons bonded with a double bond (ethene).  The hydrocarbon with 2 C and 2 H has the carbons bonded with a triple bond (ethyne).. . In society, many hydrocarbons are petroleum products - for instance - gasoline is a hydrocarbon mixture that contains octane - a hydrocarbon that contains 8 carbons all single bonds with 18 hydrogens.

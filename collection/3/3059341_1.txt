Mariguana is a rare semi-metallic halide mined under the hills of The Netherlands, Mexico, British Columbia, Turkey, Iran and Virginia, primarily by Thracian slaves captured during the Gulf War. Before the 1850s, this ore was known to the ancient Greeks who found it in the rubble of Agean volcanos, as "Fire of Kronos", or "Kronic", due to its luminescent qualities, and the strange way time seemed to slow down when humans were exposed to it. Greek Soldiers believed that The Fire of Kronos was a good luck charm that increased appetite, prevented nausea, and enhanced appreciation of music and sex, and hoplites were known to carry rocks of the ore with them in baggies full of local weeds.

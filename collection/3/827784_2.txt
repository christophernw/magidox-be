I have found that the most helpful things are chiropractic care and massage.  . Homedics has a self massager for your neck that feels like a true massage.  It has 2 "fingers" that move around and massage around your neck.  You can find it online.  Not a vibrating massager,  it is called Homedics Shiatsu Massager.  Works great and is reasonably priced.  Cheaper than paying for massages too!

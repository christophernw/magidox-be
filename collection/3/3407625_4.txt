Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder that causes widespread pain and tenderness in the muscles and soft tissue (including tender points) as well as sleep problems, fatigue, and a variety of other symptoms. These problems can be severe enough to disrupt a person's work and daily activities. Fortunately, the condition does not permanently damage the muscles, joints, or internal organs.

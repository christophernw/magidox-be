Gamma Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) was originally developed as an anaesthetic, but withdrawn due to unwanted side effects. Other uses have been for the treatment of narcolepsy, for the relief of symptoms when withdrawing from dependant alcohol use and more recently as a growth hormone stimulant used by body builders.. . It can be used as a recreational drug but too little can make you dozy, too much can make your go into a coma and just about right is supposed to be quite pleasant.. . The problem is getting the dose right, it has also been used as a date rape drug.

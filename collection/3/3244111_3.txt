My son is an artist and this has always been a problem for him as a "Stude".  He exceled in art but lacked in other subjects.  There are many students that fit in this category.  I believe that most students do not fit in the ART field and therefore would probably not even make a passing grade in Art, however, the defense for this objective would be the fact that those who lack in regular classroom studies usually excel in Art.  There are too many talented kids falling through the cracks due to the school systems not picking up on the students and pushing them to do what they have been gifted with in life.  You will find many wonderful Artists in our penal systems throughout the US.  If there were a way to help you change the system, I would be the first because I was constantly fighting the school system when my son was in school.  He barely passed and now paints buildings and makes a living with his ART.  It is a much needed pathway for some students.  Do what you can and push as hard as you can to get someone to understand the necessity of Art.  Someone will listen and possibly they will open up an alternative school for those who would otherwise "fall through the cracks".  They opened one here in Lawton, Oklahoma.

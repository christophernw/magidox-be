I guess you mean drink and smoke at the same time,right?  The smoking bit is what's illegal, as well as harmful, and the ban is to protect the health of those who want to drink or work in a pub and don't want someone else's smoke to contaminate them.  If you can't control your smoking, hard cheese, but don't inflict it on other people.

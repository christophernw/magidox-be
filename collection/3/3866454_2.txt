Certain music does effect people. Classical music is credited with promoting intelligence & it is recomended that expectant mothers listen to it to promote intellegence in their infants. . Heavy rock or similar music is said to promote anger & violence.. Other music can make us, energetic, sad, etc.... . In Vaughn Paul Manley's The Hidden Messages of Water Signs (ISBN 0743289803). it reported how water was effected by different words & music. I also has beautiful illustrations showing how the water crystals were effected. It is a very interesting book.

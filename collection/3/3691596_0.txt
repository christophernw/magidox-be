general relativity includes special relativity, but is mostly about how gravity works and large objects warp spacetime, causing other objects to come near them. special relativity deals with the effects of moving really fast, and how light travels at the same speed relative to any observer, so observers at different speeds will disagree on length, time and mass of things they observe.. . general - about big stuff. special - about fast stuff

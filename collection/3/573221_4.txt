Some religions like buddism emphasis majorly on "success" and "prosperity", and i find a lot of devout Buddhists are "doing right" so that their "prosperous" time will come.. . Mean while, religion like Christianity- if followed right sees money as just a tool to get by, nothing more. Christians -theoretically- only want to spread the gospel, so there shouldn't be any strong link between money and religion for them.. I guess it depends on religion to religion.

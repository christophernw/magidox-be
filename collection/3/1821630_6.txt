Mothers Day doesnt distinguish between single or married mothers. If you had a kid, Mother's Day is your day.. . What I want to know is, why isnt there a day for CHILDLESS MEN and WOMEN? We pay taxes for schools we get no benefit from. Taxes for welfare for all those SINGLE MOMS who couldnt keep their legs together. "We deserve a lot" you wrote. Why? Because you could have sex with a man but not find him fit enough to help raise and pay for his child? You want recognition and respect? Send that Welfare check back to me, I need the money too.. . And since when Mexicans get a day? If youre referring to Cinco de Mayo, thats a MEXICAN holiday, not an American one.

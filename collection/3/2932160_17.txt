I used to have the same problem and i realized some days are way worse than others when it comes to getting easily distracted and procrastinating..  But what really helps me is when I write down fun stuff I really wanted to do that day (like go to the mall, or watch Lost) and tell myself i can't do any of it until i finish my homework. What also helps me is if i give my self 10-20 minutes to do each thing and if i cant finish it in time, ill just go back to it later.  The more you think about how good it will feel to finally get everything done, the easier itl b to get it done.  Hope I could help.

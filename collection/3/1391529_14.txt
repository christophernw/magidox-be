NO WAY, its all how you bring them up I've know one and it is that gentle,,,, yes i believe that something should be done but only as far as anyone with a pitbull should have a license because they ARE a beautiful animal,  what your saying is that HUMANS have the right to play god (by the way im not religious) and decide what will live and wot wont...no way its totally against me.....i no they are nice animals because my friend has 2(Male n Female) and just had a litter pups too... she takes the dogs down the beach OFF the leash (just like any other dog breed)they go up to other dogs and have a sniff as the other dog does and when she calls them they come straight back....and really humans including u n i and all other people have no right to say stuff like that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. . P.s- ARRRRRRRRRRR.......People ...SHAME ON YOU

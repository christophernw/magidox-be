I am amazed at all the people posting what mormons believe about God, Christ, etc, and have NO IDEA.  They obviously are not LDS (Mormon) as what they are saying is all half truths.  We believe that God has ALWAYS (Eternal Father) been the God of this Universe, and although certain mormons have speculated in their own books .. NO it has never been taught that God had relations with Mary. We are taught that the spirit descended on Mary and then she was with child.. a biblical teaching.  The biggest difference is Yes we do Believe in God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit as one God (Trinity), but three seperate personages.  A teaching I might remind you that was so prevalent during and after Jesus time that the Catholic Church had to hold a meeting with the worlds top religious scholars to decide what version of this should be taught to their believers (the Nicean Creed 354 a.d.) Due to this and many other seemingly vague doctrines, we now have MANY different Christian religions in the world.  Thats where the word "protestant" comes from. So, yes, it differs from some popular religions, but preaches about the Christ who is "the only begotten of the Father", Born to VIRGIN Mary, crucified on the Cross of Calvary, took the sins of the world upon Him so that ALL men may be saved.  What Christ do you believe in?. As to why they don't have sex... it's the same reason that all religions taught don't have sex before your married until the 1960's.  Christ taught that you should not have relations with anyone other than who you are married to.  Thats why he sent the woman on her way saying "SIN no more"  it's a teaching that we believe strongly in.  But after marriage... well Mormons are known for large families.. . Again... due to El's comment I am amazed at the amount of regurgitated misinformation.

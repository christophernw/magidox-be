The cycle of the pin worm.  Pin worms live in the ground and if you had bare feet the pin worm will get into your foot, get into your blood stream, and come out through your lung.  Then it crawl up and over into your digestive tract where is produces its eggs.  The medicine against them plugs up their digestive tract. Since they can't eat, they  die.

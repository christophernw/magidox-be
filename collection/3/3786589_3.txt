Try Ponds cold cream or a sunburn gel as they contain benzocaine which is a form of lidocaine a numbing agent. If you have an aloe plant you can use the leaves from it. Just split it down the middle and scrape out the gel and core meat. then apply it to the burn and leave uncovered for temp conduction.  Good luck!

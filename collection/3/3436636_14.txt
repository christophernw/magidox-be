As you call yourself "Christian", the answer is probably: "Christianity is the only true religion", or something to that extent.. . "The believer is not free to have any conscience at all for questions of "true" and "untrue": to have integrity on *this* point would at once destroy him.". [Nietzsche, The Antichristian, section 54.]

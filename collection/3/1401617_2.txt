Well is bar liquor.....Call is "by name"... . The alcohols on hand for "well" drinks are just cheaper... . You can ask for a "Rum and Coke" "Whiskey and Coke". Vodka and Seven-up... Gin and Tonic... etc... and you will get the bar's (on hand) alcohol........ . Or you can "call" and pay more.....Bacardi Rum.. Jack Daniels Whiskey, Smirnoff Vodka.. Tangueray Gin... etc... (just to name a few)

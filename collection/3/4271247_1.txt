that is a good question have you ever saw someone you love with someone else or they said something that makes you feel like you're on a roller coaster or your heart is going to beat out of your chest, or been so mad you actually feel the heat come from your body and you adrenaline going crazy, that is feeling. At the time you never go through the process of thinking "that hurt i am going to feel sick now or i am mad"  i think feeling is more of a non planned event that happens quickly and thinking is more rational, and patient.

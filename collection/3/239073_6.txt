She admires you and doesn't want to be far from you.  She's not pushy, but if you move, she wants to follow quietly behind you.  (I just made that up.) But our animals do observe us and know what we are going to do next before we do.  Just go over and give her a nice head rub and tell her some sweet words and she'll be reassured and maybe take a cat nap.

"Career Opportunities . . Most professionals command an enviable salary, and certified accountants are no exception. People and organizations will pay a high price for the financial and technical expertise you will develop en route to the ACCA qualification. ACCA's flexible training requirements mean that you may work for a multinational company and find yourself seconded to overseas subsidiaries; or for an individual running their own business, auditing and preparing accounts for small local companies. You may work in the city for a commercial organization operating at the sharp end of finance; or you may experience the variety offered by a public service employer, such as a national or local government office, ensuring allocated funds are spent effectively and public services run smoothly.". . I got this one off the net because I was curious about a description outside of Keller Graduate School (I am almost there MA-CFA) {Keller has several Master Accounting programs - Financial Management; Certified Financial Analyst; Certified Accountant, Certified Fraud Examiner and there are certificate programs that are cumulative towards Master's programs.}. . If anyone is "interested in this program of study" please contact me.  This is my forte.  I don't give answers; but will be happy to be a coach in this arena :)

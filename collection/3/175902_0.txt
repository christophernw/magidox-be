you could try a humane trap, but you have to make sure if you get the mom trapped, you get all the babies too, it might be best to call someone to trap them safely and relocate them.. speaking of opposums, i almost hit a baby the other night, i almost wrecked missing it.....ugh. but i would have cried my eyes out if i had ran over it

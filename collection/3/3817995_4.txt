That is easy, just enforse the laws that already exist. I would go after the employers, I would arrest and put the people in jail that do the hiring, I would fine the company's that have illegal aliens working for them enough so that they knew it was wrong to do so. I think this would solve the problem. NO WORK = NO MONEY= NO REASON TO BE HERE.

Try to figure out the cause.. . Are you getting enough water?  A headache may be caused by dehydration, so in that case, you just need to up your water intake.. . Are you addicted to caffeine and going through withdrawls?  It won't help kick the habit, but drink a cup of coffee/tea or a soda.. . Is it caused by stress?  Try aromatherapy, getting a massage, or taking a nice long warm bath.

microdermabrasion... you can go to a dermatologist or you can buy an OTC brand like the ones they sell in the beauty aisles at CVS... it's like a face wash with a scrubbing brush and an astringent. It worked for me when i started getting them I used to have a perfect complexion i went to CVS and bought a neutrogena one and i dont have them anymore it also decreased the size of my pores

There are alternative theories which you may apply for explanation. of LIFE in our universe. The most popular one is also the simplest. of them, that is the religious theory which asserts that  Life,. and the entire Universe is created by the Almighty God. Basicly. We all tend to believe this argument at least for its hollistic nature. and its consistency. On the other hand there is the Scientific view. which attemts to give explanation to the complexities of Life,. without contradicting the Bisics ,as to the origin of life in a so called theological paradigm.. As a result one could say that  it is logical to accept that the Universe and all its life forms are planned and organized by a . central authority which most of us call God. In this context. Science is nothing but the sofware employed by that central. authrity in the art of creation. Which we are discovering in our. own pace.

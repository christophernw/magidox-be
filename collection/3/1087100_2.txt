You no doubt can not get around a BA or BS. If you can apply all two years of AA Degree get the BA or BS, then find how many education credits, and in what, you need to be certified in your state-get those. Apply for cert. Many schools strapped for teachers will help you once you get the degree. So you assume correctly and I just wasted a number of key strokes. Think of how many years are ahead of you and what a small % of the time getting the degree is compared to your life.

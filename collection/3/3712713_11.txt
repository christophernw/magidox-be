Well I have to ask..did something happen that made your friends change their minds about being friends with you?..And if they decided not to be your friend could this be a better thing for you.  Are you about to go to another school?..If so great because you will have many opportunities to meet lots of new friends. Growing up is sometimes confusing...friends will come and go..sometimes friends can be disappointing..but true friends will be with you for along time and accept you for you. I experienced this at your age and it can be very hurtful and confusing..so keep you head held high and be a kind and generous friend (no money just kindness and acceptance of others) and you will draw friends of the same kind...I hope you find true friends that will love and accept you for you...

If you haven't already done this, wash the area where he was stung in vinegar or use meat tenderizer on it - this deactivates the toxins from the jellyfish so he isn't continuing to be "stung" by leftover bits on his skin.  You can apply hydrocortisone cream to the area (2-3 times a day) and give him pain killers like Tylenol or ibuprofen.  If the pain persists and worsens or he seems to be having an allergic reaction, get him to a doctor.  Otherwise, he'll just have to kind of tough it out. :o(

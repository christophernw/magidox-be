Other than curiosity, people are also inclined to open things that are not familiar in their everyday circumstances because of the chance it is something worth looking at. Take for example a pop up that promises a vacation to a tropical island if the user clicks the correct answer. Because there is a chance it could happen (though there is a chance that negates that), the person clicks it even if that had been the 31st pop up they have encountered for the night.

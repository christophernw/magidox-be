The sarcastic answer that pilots will give you: "Push forward, pull back". . The honest answer, go to your local airport, it'll likely have  a flight school and talk to a flight instructor.  Go on a "discovery" or "introductory" flight... you'll go up with an instructor for 15-30 minutes and he/she will let you fly the plane for a little bit.  If you like it and feel like it's something you want to do, then you can start taking lessons.. . http://www.beapilot.com lists flight schools and offers introductory flights for $59.  . AOPA also has a list of flight schools: http://www.aopa.org/learntofly/school/index.cfm

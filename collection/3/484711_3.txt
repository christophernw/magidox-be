The legends of King Arthur have always struck me as the embodiment of all that man can achieve (from a human standpoint).  Taking chaos and molding it into a fair attempt at utopia, with all the adventure and evil that we all face daily.  Camelot can be an inspiration for anyone taking the time to study and enjoy it.  One man's opinion.

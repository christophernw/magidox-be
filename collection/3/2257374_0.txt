Any metal will melt on heating (unless burning up before), but for pure lead the melting point is fairly low with 600K (327°C, or 621°F). The melting point for lead alloys (with tin and/or antimon) is even lower.. . Even candle flames emit sufficient heat to melt down lead placed on a spoon in reasonable time.

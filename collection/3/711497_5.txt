Simple answer:  Men. . There is something in the Y-Chromosome that causes men to believe anything that a perky woman says. If the infomercial could find a way to have that perky woman go up to every man individually in the audience and tell how handsome or sexy or manly, etc. he looks with that product, they would.  And most of the time, it would work.

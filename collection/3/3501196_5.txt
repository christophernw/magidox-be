Simple, we have 24 hours becouse when we created the time zones, we made 24 different zones. So when the sun completed a trip and reached the 24th zone, it would start a new day. We created 24 zones useing longetude. It's simply mathatical caculation and old science to prevent confusuion. 24 was also determined becouse thats how long it takes for the earth to complete a full day revelution. (24.15 hours actually) but thats seconds off the day.

If you cannot get an appointment right away, the following the  procedures may help to relieve (NOT CURE) the toothache:. . •Apply moist heat outside of the face (5 minutes on and 5 minutes off for 30 minutes and repeat every 4 hours). •Rinse your mouth with warm salt water (hold for 1 minute then spit). •Avoid sticky foods. •Chew on the other side of the mouth . •Massage the area between your thumb and the your finger for 5 minutes (acupressure). •Take some pain relievers (see below). •Take antibiotics such as amoxil 500mg three times a day for 1 week.  If you are allergic to penicillin, then use clindamycin 300mg twice a day for 1 week). . The pathophysiology of dental pain is a complex central and peripheral nervous system process, and the use of combination analgesics that act at multiple pain sites can improve pain relief.

For the treatment of mild to moderate dental pain, the most appropriate options are:. •Acetaminophen (Tylenol), 650mg every 4-6 hour as needed for pain;. •Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs (Advil, Motrin, Aleve), 400mg every 4-6 hours as needed for pain; and. .

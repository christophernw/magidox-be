Try setting aside some time to think about what you'd really LIKE to do. It's easier to be self motivated if the task involved is actually a pleasure rather than a chore.. . Be gentle with yourself - you don't have to be motivated to do stuff you don't want to do. Slowly try to re-arrange your circumstances, one little step at a time, so that you spend more time doing what you really want to do.

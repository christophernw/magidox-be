Well, if that wetland is a protected zone, you really shouldn't mess with it. Wetlands are a very essential flushing system for the planet, and they've been taking a lot of abuse; many of them are protected areas now, or have endangered species in them. Whatever you do, DO NOT plant water hyacinth, they look pretty, but they are very invasive and will completely take over. Also, do not plant any duckweed (Lemna, although I don't think that this is commercial), not only are they a weed, but they will clog drainage systems.

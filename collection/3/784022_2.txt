They come out at all times of the day. I have had experiences with them in the middle of the day, early in the morning...it really matters not to them. They do not know time like humans know time. It is much faster for them.. . But for the most part, my experiences with ghosts have been at night, or twilight. The ghosts in my house love to torment me when I'm taking a shower...like opening and closing my bathroom door.. . Once a ghost even took the form of my mother....but I'm not sure if that was a ghost or if it was a demon. Let me go into detail...I was cooking and I could hear my mother down the hallway in her bedroom humming, the light was on. Then, seconds later, I see the light go off and her walking down the hallway to enter the living room. I asked her a question and no answer...when I walked into the living room she wasn't there. So I went back to the stove, a bit disturbed. I looked down the hallway and her light was on. Then she really did walk down the hallway. When I told her about the whole ordeal she said nothing, just looked at me in disbelief...it was very strange. I remember, though, that when the image of my mother seemingly walked down the hallway there was no translucency...she looked completely solid, completely herself. But she made no sound, her footfalls were effortless as they never are....now that I think on it. So it couldn't have been her...but that remains to be the strangest thing that's happened to me.. . But at all hours of the day they seem to show up in different parts of my house, they look straight at me, but their faces are never distinguishable. It seems that they want to communicate with me, but they always disappear before I can even try to talk to them...if that's even possible. . . I know...it's sounds ridiculous, but this is what I know. It seems we have many skeptics in this world, but they rarely remain skeptics with as haunted as this world is.

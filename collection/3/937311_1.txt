First off you are sick to ask that if you do not have a true purpose for it.. . Two if you do not need the milk and just want to rid of whats in the breast take her to the doc and they will give you pills to dry up the milk.. . Third if you are trying to feed puppies that she had but she isnt lactating then you need to go and get puppy milk from the store till you have the mom checked out.. . Fourth, its easy to do but I will not explain due to the fact I dont know the manor of which this question is comming from.

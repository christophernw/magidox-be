an analog signal is similar to listening to a speaker, you have multiple frequencies runing along distributing information, the multiple frequencies alow for many signals at once.. Digital would be like listening to a teligraph, it works by sending little pulses which are translated on the other end. in some ways analog is beter, while other ways digital is beter. digital is not always beter because you can realy only send one signal at a time. analog, however, can send many signals at once. EX coaxle tv cable. unfortunatly, if you have a cheap cable, the signals will leak and mix together. they say that digital cable is beter, but it still enters as an analog signal. digital signal will not, however, leak and mix together like analog.. Kinda crazy, huh?

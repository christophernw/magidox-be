First off find something he loves that will fit in his mouth just right, i.e. a toy . then when you toss it only a short distance, when he picks it up do not walk towards him this will encourage him to run with it, then start to back up, slowly with a reward in your hand, a small treat will do. continue with this until it becomes second nature to fetch.

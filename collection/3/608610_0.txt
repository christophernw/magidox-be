My guess is that the term "Generation X" was coined somewhere in a popular newspaper or magazine and then people started copying it.  "Generation Y" is just a borrowing of Generation X (but tne next one).  I have no evidence whatsoever to back up this idea, but a little Internet searching might reveal what were the first times the terms were used.

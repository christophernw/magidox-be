It could be many things, but a visit to a doctor to check your rheumatoid factors may be in order.  Polyarthraligia (pain in multiple joints) with swelling, weakness, or instability can be signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.  Osteoarthritis, on the other hand, is usually felt in one joint at a time.  A visit with a doctor would be the best bet!

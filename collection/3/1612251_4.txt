the christian faith, being a patriarchal heirarchy, chose to refer to god as a man, somewhere down the line, people got nervous and confirmed that god is a man...personally i think thats stupid, i feel that no father has ever had a connection to his children that was so strong that he himself suffered when they did, i do believe that god is a woman.

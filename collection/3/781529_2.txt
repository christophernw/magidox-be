Well as far as the economy goes, the Nazis focused on the military because it was the quickest way to get Germany out of the Depression and because they wanted to expand (obviously).  . Nazis were socialists, national socialist to be more specific, however they hated Communism, hence tensions with Russia.  Capitalism was a threat to their totalitarian state so they didn't particularly like that either.

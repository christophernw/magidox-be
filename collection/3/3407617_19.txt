First of all the kind of love that Jesus had for Mary Magdaline was not that kind of love. Yes, Jesus loved prostitutes, He loves everyone, in fact there is a prostitute in His liniage. Prostitution is wrong 1) because it says so various places in the Bible, 2) the Bible also says that sex outside of marriage is a sin and prostitution occurs outside of marriage, and 3) the Bible says to follow the law of the land and the law of the land (at least in the US) says that prostitution is illegal.

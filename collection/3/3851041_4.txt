I've noticed that people have chips on their shoulders and so they let that control how they answer. Usually ending up with them completely misunderstanding your question. Like some women who answer questions about gender. If a guy askes something like, "Do some girls have it easier if they're beautiful", some bitter women will somehow turn the question into how men are pigs and women get paid less in the work world. And then call YOU a pig just for asking a question about beauty. I've had that happen.

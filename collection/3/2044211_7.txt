new or used?..  cruiser or street/racing type.  Engine size is a big deal.  Remember that a 600cc bike is small in comparison but can still through you off the second you pull that throttle!  So be careful.  If you are a first time rider, I'd suggest starting with a smaller bike (600cc is good).  Maybe even look into buying a used 600cc or around that size.  Then move up to a 750cc later on.  You also want to try and get a good feel for your bike just sitting on it.  Does it feel comfortable.  Depending on how often and for how long each time you are planning on riding.. ie. how long is your ride to work?  Make sure you'll be comfortable for the whole ride.  Also weather in your area is a big factor.  Are you prepared to ride to work when it's pooring rain out? Or do you have a backup plan??   Good Luck and Happy Riding!! =)  Oh yeah!..  and remember that bikes are huge targets for theft so keep it insured or locked away out of sight in a garage or something.

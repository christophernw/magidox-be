If you file for bankruptcy then you will lose your house you will also lose any credit that you may have which will haunt you for about 15 years....this is normally a "last resort" so if you plan on doing this remember that it will affect your credit in a severely negative way and it will be almost impossible for you to get a loan for anything in the near future (15 years) so make sure that you have thought it through and if you do file then make sure it's the last thing possible to do. Good Luck!

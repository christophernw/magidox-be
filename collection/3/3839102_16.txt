Religions never forced people. It is the religious people who do. But once a religious person becomes 'truly' religious, steps into a newer dimension of life out of deepening of awareness of newer levels of consciousness, he does not anymore need to 'ensure' his own sense of security by forcing others and thus somehow maintain 'a good and comfortable majority' !

Three members of the genus Clostridium, C. welchii (perfringens), C novyi (oedematiens), and C. septicum, may produce gas gangrene; at least three other members of this genus may contribute to such a process though incapable of producing it themselves.. Infections associated with gas gangrene are often mixed and include various anaerobic organisms as well as toxicogenic clostridia. . Visit: http://www.histopathology-india.net/GasGa.htm

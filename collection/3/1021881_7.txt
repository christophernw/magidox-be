It was just a conspiracy by a patriarchal religion to supress their women.  They twisted childbirth pains (which ALL creatures have, not just humans, and what loving god would punish innocent creatures as well as the transgressor?) all around, too.  They wanted to make everything related to women seem wrong.. . I'd have liked to see them have the children, though!  Hehehe.

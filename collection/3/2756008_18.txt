Evolution stopped ; poppycock if I ever did here it.. . Evolution is the accidental genetic mutation of a gene that propogates itself in an environment. The mutation itself does not have to be 'better' than what it was before but if it is the case that survival in a enviromnent would be greater with that mutation then it is kept. This means that following mutations are not accidental but deliberate. Im terms of genes for race and skin colour this is basic genetics which im sure you are aware of, remember two black people can actually produce a white child but it doesnt work the other way around.. . Just a thought if I ate nothing but blueberries would I eventually turn blue?

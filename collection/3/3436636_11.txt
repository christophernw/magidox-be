I know what Jesus thought about Religious People he knew they liked Ceremonies and Laws.  So he said . in James 1:27 Pure Religion undefiled before God The Father is this. Visit the Fatherless and Widows in their Affliction, to keep  him self unspotted from the World. He did not say Tithe-Go to a certain building to worship-Eat certain Foods -or worship on a certain day. this is the worlds kind of religion not God's.

As I understand it, you are a vegetarian, and intend to gross out meat-eaters to the point where they may stop eating meat.  Instead, my instinct is to say why must you force your ideas on others?  What is it about vegetarians that they cannot accept the fact that we don't all want to risk protein deprivation just to give in to squeamishness, particularly when the actual slaughter and cleaning of the animals is done by professionals under clean conditions, and we are not personally involved.. . I have heard hunters -- who must be at the opposite extreme of your feelings in the matter -- say that anyone who is unwilling or unable to kill their own food and clean a carcass does not deserve to eat.  In both cases, you and they are denying the obvious fact that modern life involves specialization.  Should we not have doctors because I can't imagine passing a course in gross anatomy and having to dissect a human cadaver?  Isn't it useful that some people have strong stomachs and can do the necessary, and are paid for it by those of us who can't?  Ever hear of "Crime Scene Cleaners, Inc.?"  I pray you never need their services, but they are worth every penny of their fees.. . And why not have polite words for things?  We certainly need polite words for the sexual matters in our lives, or many of us could not talk about them at all.  And we clearly need polite terms for the things police and plumbers have to deal with, don't we?  It isn't a question of what they "really" are; they really are the polite words as well as the rude ones.

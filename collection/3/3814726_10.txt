Steam it, do not boil it, steam it in a double boiler or steamer.  Steam LIGHTLY for about ten minutes, check it with a fork if you are not sure and when the fork has a little resistence, it's done.  You don't want to over cook it.  Butter and salt if you like.  When you buy it, the smaller the end of the stalk, the better the asperegus, it means the bottom hasn't turned woody yet.  When asperagus sprouts it becomes an incredibly large bush, so you want to make sure it wasn't picked too late.  Check for a bottom that is as green as the top is

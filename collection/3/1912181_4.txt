My hubby and I have that issue/ SOme say it helps to set time before you go to bed to write down all the stuff on your mind, take a set amount of minutes to deal with them, put them away and go to sleep. I have to have some sort of sound to help distract my mind. SOmetimes I take benydril to help (yes my doc said it was ok)

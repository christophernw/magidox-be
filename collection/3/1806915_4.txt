Everything influences what kind of person someone will grow up to be. It's not always good and it's not always bad. Situations and how they solve situations are main influences. Too many people have been put into horrible situations and have gotten out by themselves without telling anybody, they become really self reliant or mean and defiant. It also has to do with how a person thinks. Outside forces can only do so much if the inner thoughts don't reflect them.

Well, in the first place, Christian fundamentalists are ironically very un-Christian in every respect except what they call themselves. It's weird, but the biggest "Christians" are the least Christian.. . A true fundamentalist in the accurate sense of the word would be living in poverty, shunning the worldly things, and doing endless charity work, like Mother Theresa, or Buddhist monks.

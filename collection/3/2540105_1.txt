Chemical engineering is a vast field with many possibilities for specialisation. Oil and petroleum industries use a lot of chemical engineers, but anything from soap, tires, fertilizer, plastics, lubricants, adhesives and many others require chemical engineers.. . At my university chemical engineering was one of the few engineering disciplines that boasted a male/female ratio of 50/50.

Sexual arousal is almost always used.  Sometimes very subtle, ie. phallic symbols or women wearing revealing clothes.  They camouflage  sexual shapes in a mind blowing amount of magazine ads. Sometimes, it's in your face like the Carl's Jr. commercial where a barely dressed woman rides and grinds a mechanical bull while eating a hamburger.   (They finally threw some men in there for the ladies with their milk shake commercials...yummy.  At least it's equal now, LOL).

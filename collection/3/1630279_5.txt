It sounds like he's marking his territory. Its a common male trait. If he's not neutered, you should get him neutered, although this will not DEFINATELY stop the problem, some fixed cats spray as well. You could check him for a urinary tract infection, but this seems unlikely because usually when there's an infection there is straining to urinate and the cat is usually in obvious pain to urinate anywhere.. . If the neutering doesn't help you could ask your vet for options.

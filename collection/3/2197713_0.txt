You were probably tired and did not realize it until you slowed down and relaxed, which brings me to my theory of why books look the way they do. Picture lying in your cave reading the latest issue of 'Better Hunting and Gathering', you fall asleep and that damned stone tablet smashes your nose again! This prompted the discovery of softer material and a design which allows the scroll, book or magazine to gently drape over the face, protecting the nose.

while I'm not any of the above, I do respect them.  They are actually out trying to live thier work and be among the people.  People did this for Christ back in the day.  I think other religions would rather seclude themselves and judge others.  They are following the Bible in going out an spreading the word.  While I don't subscribe to any of those religions I respect them for that.  They are also some of the nicest people you could want to meet.

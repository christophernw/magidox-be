When an object is placed on a wooden table, it is at rest on the table.. . Actually the object bends the wood a little, the depression is so small that we are not able to detect it. This can be understood by imagining that what would happen if a huge rock is placed on the wooden top.. . The object is at rest because the downward weight is balanced by the elastic force of the wooden top which tends to regain its original shape. If this elastic force is not sufficient to balance the weight the object goes down.. . . The same thing happens in the case of objects floating in the liquid.. . The cork or wood when placed on the surface of water, it displaces some amount of liquid. The displaced liquid tries to fill the space from which it is displaced. This in turn gives a upthrust on the object.. . If the force equals the weight of cork then it floats, Other wise like in the case of stone, it sinks.. . It can be shown that if the density of the object is less than that of water, then the object will float; if it is greater than that of water then it will sink.. . Imagine a sphere of wate inside the water; it is rest on any place inside the water because its density is the same as water.

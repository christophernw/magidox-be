prostitution will always be here and so will religious nuts who think it is the worst thing in the world. The people who oppose it the most are the hypocrit johns and religioooous leaders who use protitutes themselves. Married women usually also hate prostitutes but should be thankful to them for providing a safe place for their husbnads to cheat rather than having a girlfriend. The cops act like when they arrest hookers they are catching serial killers! The streetwalkers now are addicts doing it for $5.00 which is so sad since if they cleaned up and got a car they could get $200 for the same thing.

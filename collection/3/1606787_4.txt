At the earlier time, the blacks were hated because people see them as an outsider/intruder to their country. Actually, they are the victim, their ancestors was brought in against their own will. The other reason is, some people cannot open their mind to accept people that is different from their own nature.  Nobody can change their own point of view but themselves. One secret to live in harmony is to push away our differences and try to concentrate to our similarity instead.

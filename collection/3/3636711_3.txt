I went to your website and saw multiple bands so i really don't know which one you were.  Since I couldn't answer your question I'll give you advice and say that I too have family in bands and trying to rap and I know how hard it is, so again my advise to you is to keep trying and if you get your music out there and KEEP TRYING NEW THINGS I'm sure the public Would Love it

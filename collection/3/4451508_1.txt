THe carpal tunnel is a tunnel formed with the carpals and ligaments. The carpal tunnel houses arteries, veins, nerves, and tendons, all neatly packed in a tunnel. Problems arise from inflammation of the ligaments or internal structures which can eventually lead to inhibiting nerve pulses and blood supply. Hence the feeling of tingling sensation with carpal tunnel syndrome.

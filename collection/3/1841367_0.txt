These are called winglets. They improve the efficiency of aircraft by lowering the lift-induced drag caused by wingtip vortices. Winglets work by increasing the effective aspect ratio of a wing without adding greatly to the structural stress and hence necessary weight of its structure. Most modern jets have winglets.

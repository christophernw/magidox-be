eat properly but lightly. If you tend towards low blood sugar, eat regularly throughout the day. Avoid high impact glycemic foods (lots of quick carbs), they'll provide fast energy but they'll also run out fast and leave you flat. Look for complex carbs, seeds, nuts, fruit, veg, etc. and a bit of protein, soy nuts or cheese.

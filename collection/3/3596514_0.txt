if children could write a report on a cartoon episode then i think they could boost their english grades up atleast 1 grade lol funny how they can remember every word to their favorite cartoon movie, yet they cant remember to put a period at the end of their sentences :D. . my son would pick the sonic the hedgehog cartoon

insert a dummy 0x^2 and 0x on divisor and divide like you would w/out x'es. . for instance, how many x^3+0x^2+0x+5 fit in x^4 thru 2x... then do normal divising techniques for remainder, divide within 6x^3 thru -1 and then the remainder is over x^3+5. . yes, polynomial long division, but you have to have all the x^? between the highest and the (-1 or +5) so you put in "dummy" zero's for the x^? not there.

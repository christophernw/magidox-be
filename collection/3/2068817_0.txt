You'll owe a penalty. If you get to it relatively soon, the penalty shouldn't be huge.  There's a form you can get to ask for an automatic extension--you should file it as soon as you can.. . As long as you don't do anything really outrageous, they won't try to put in jail, but sooner or later, they'll get their money, and the sooner it is, the less money it will be.

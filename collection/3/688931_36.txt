I understand that it is a bit bad to be forced to learn something, but you could say the same for physics. you will not really need it unless you use it as a scientist or so. But I think only speaking english is a stupid choice, because the US work with countries all around the world and speaking a second language, especially spanish, is really useful now in the US.

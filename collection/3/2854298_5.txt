the tricks of the english language...wet is caused by water ( duh!)..and by a change of state from solid to liquid..or by condensation from vapor back to liquid..and of course when dew point is reached and it falls on your head.. . Try the same question in Russian or in Farsi and you'll find that the relation of water to wet will vary.

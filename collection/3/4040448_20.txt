We don't "worship" the President, especially not like the liberals' knee-padded Kool-Aid drinking worship of Clinton.. . And Bush in not paranoid or schizophrenic, unlike many of his critics.. . He doesn't "hear voices", he prays to God. And if you knew the least thing about religious people (which you most obviously do not), you would know that when they seek guidance from the Lord in their prayer, when they determine a course of action, they will consider it as guidance from the Lord. In any case, that decision is still based on the sound reasons and logic that made that decision viable in the first place.. . Your pathetic little distortion of what happened is typical of people like you - for some reason, your points only make sense if you buy into the lies.

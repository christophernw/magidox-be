I think it really depends on what field you're going into.. . In the internet and e-commerce world I come across this all the time as a hiring manager, and, each time my offer to the recent grad with no experience is less than what I offer to someone with experience.. . Bachelor's degrees are a dime a dozen these days.  All they really indicate is that you are "trainable."  If you want to have the best advantage through education, get a PhD.

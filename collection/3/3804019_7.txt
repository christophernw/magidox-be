It cost sooooo much money that they haven't got.  They are looking to get back to the moon soon (ish) few years yet tho,  when they get to the moon, they'll look at how they can fly to mars from there. This isn't gonna be for years and years yet.. They can spot metorites just as well from earth so they don't need to go to mars to do that

We are living in what the Bible calls "The last days".  God tells us that in the end times  people's hearts will begin to wax cold.  People are beginning to get more and more self-centered, willing to do anything it takes to get what they want, and a lot of the time, that includes violence.  I'm sorry to tell you this, but things are going to get a whole lot worse in the future before Jesus returns.. Make sure you are saved and Jesus will come back for you before things get unbearable.

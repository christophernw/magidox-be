Dropshipping is a term used to describe the process of a company that will ship your product to your customer, and bill you.  This saves you from having to pay freight from company to you and then having to pay freight to your customer.  Means you don't have to handle the merchandise.  Almost any company will drop ship merchandise to your customers - all you have to do is pay for the merchandise and usually the freight.

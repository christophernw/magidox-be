I am in the same situation with being the only christian in teh family and let me tell ya, its tough, but your friend is wrong, sex has to wait for marriage man, but i believe the right answer is no sex untill marriage, and the whole saving your body for your wife thing, like not revealing certain body parts, i mean making out and being all huggin' and holdin' hands is definatley fine no doubt, but you have to save those feelings of sex and your body parts for your wife. if you are a christian a big rule is no sex untill marraige,

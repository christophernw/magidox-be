Scientists realize that almost all galaxies in the universe are moving rapidly away from each other.  If you think of it as an ongoing movie film it is easy to imagine what would happen if you reversed the film and went back in time to the beginning of the film and the galaxies converge.  They also know that matter within a black hole can collapse under tremendous gravity such that atoms and molecules and perhaps protons and neutrons are no longer physical entities.  Therefore, the universe may have begun as a special black hole, a singularity, where all the laws of physics were unknowable and unimaginable.  Some how it began to expand (the big bang) and is still expanding as you read this.

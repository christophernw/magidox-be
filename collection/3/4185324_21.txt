Some, but not all T.V. evangelists are false prophets and if you pray for discernment, God will show you beyond all doubt which ones are false and which ones are real.. A simple formula is: Does this persons lifestyle and words line up with scripture? Also if what they say doesnt happen, then they are a false prophet. If they say give your life to Jesus and everything will be peaches and cream, and this doesnt happen in your life, then they are a false prophet.

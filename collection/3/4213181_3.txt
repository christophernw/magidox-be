The other answer mentioned poor muslims but almost always it has been shown that the terrorists who carry out these deeds are well educated and have the means to travel and get the materials they need. I am an American and am not surprised at the fact that there are people who want to do violent things anywhere. Like an arsonist who loves to watch a building burn, I think there is a mental state where people love to watch other people's pain and tragedy. I can't help but think that some of these terrorists are sitting back gloating and smiling about the damage they have done. It is a sickness that drives humanity apart.

Odd jobs for people...figure out what you can do the best...list them on a sheet of paper...then turn all this into a nice looking flier..then post it and your telephone number in various places...stores/laundry mats/gas stations/librarys/theaters,etc.... It is like having your own business. I guess it depends on just how ambitious and serious you really are. May God Bless

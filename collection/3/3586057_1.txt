sound is travels in the form transverse wave -- meaning the molecules of the media vibrate to and fro in the direction of the sound causing successive contractions and rarefactions. Liquid and solid media have the molecules in high concentration. That is the number of molecules in liquids and solids are far more per unit volume. The oscillating molecules experience far more attraction towards their mean postion. You can see this as a tougher spring action.. . Mathematical explantion would be far clearer but more complicated.

Synthetic oil is supposed to be a little slicker, and more resistant to high heat. It costs about FOUR times as much as petro oil, and most experts say it's not worth the extra expense. Of course, those who SELL it will SWEAR that it's the greatest invention on earth. Change your regular oil regularly, and you'll get 200,000 miles out of your car. MOST people sell the dang thing WAY before it reaches that many miles ANYWAY!!

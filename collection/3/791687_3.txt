There are two ways to smoke food.  Either with a cold smoke, where food is smoked but not cooked, or a hot smoke where foods are both smoked and cooked.. . Cold smoking can take weeks so that the smoke flavor penetrates deeply into the food.  Bacon is a good example of this.. . A hot smoke can smoke and cook a piece of meat in a matter of hours.  Fish, like salmon, make excellent candidates for this type of cooking.. . Usually pieces of very hard woods, like hickory, smolder for hours and hours generating a lot of smoke, which is channeled to where the food is located.  The closer the food is to the source of the smoke, the hotter and faster the cooking method.

What catsplayyy said. Also, when you bite off a bite of a Butterfinger bar, fragments have a tendency to slip off or fall out of the wrapper, which also makes the eater look like a butterfinger - a little clumsy but worth the inconvenience. The "butter" part might also refer to the peanut butter flavor. Oh, yeah, and haven't you heard of finger foods before? No fingers there, either.

To the person that answered, "drink in a dark room." The person asking this question is ,I'm sure, serious and he/she could be asking for alot of trouble. Of course, as most people suggested, stop the alcohol. See an Internist. You may be alergic to it. If you are and do not stop, the reaction could be totally different the next time, and you would probably be in great danger. I think the answer is very obvious. Be smart.

Overhead cam (OHC) piston engines place the camshaft above the cylinder heads and drive the valves or lifters directly instead of using pushrods. This arrangement is more complex, and relies on a timing belt or chain, but allows for greater valvetrain flexibility. Currently, engines have used single overhead camshafts (SOHC) or dual overhead camshafts (DOHC), which refers to the number of camshafts per cylinder bank.

We're not all like that. People are people and some people, regardless of their religion, are just that way; their religion doesn't necessarily have anything to do with it. Some people just like to talk alot. . . tohelpyouandyou: The JW's haven't changed anything. I could explain our doctrine to you using the KJV, New KJV, New Jerusalem Bible, New International Bible, etc. The biggest difference between our translation and, for instance, the KJV is that we haven't omitted God's name and replaced it with LORD. If you have a KJV, you may still find Jehovah in a couple of scriptures, like Psa. 83:18, but if you have the New KJV it has been omitted entirely and states this in the Forward.

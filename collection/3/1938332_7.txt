You may have received a "C" because the question that was asked needed a specific answer and maybe what you answered was not what was needed. It'll be harder to clarify why you got a C if that's the case. If the question requires an opinionated answer, then by all means, approach your professor. The best time to do this is after class. You can start by saying "Prof (name), I'd like to discuss with you the grade I received for the test we took (provide the test date and pertinent info about it). I don't understand why I received a C, instead of a/an (tell the prof. the grade you think you deserve). Could you tell me more about it?"

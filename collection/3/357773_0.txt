People all over the world are more comfortable with others who are just like them in looks, beliefs, politics. Some people call it one thing, others call it another. Intolerance, prejudice, whatever. It's a part of human nature, some people are more like that, some less. But in larger cities in general you will find more tolerance because of the sheer amount of people and differences interacted with on a daily basis. . . In your case it's religion, and the community you live in and have grown up in, NC and Georgia, have more of a protestant history and background. In my opinion, don't give in, religion or faith forced or coerced it not worth believing in.

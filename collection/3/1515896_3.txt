I'm a smoker, and do not blow my smoke in other people's face. Am also a former tobacco farmer...if our universities would research tobacco's curative values, they would discover it has many useful attirbutes. And, I am in excellent physical condition. I also do not butt into other people's business by telling them they have annoying habits.

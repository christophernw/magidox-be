You can't literally "STOP" the feeling of being scared or the feeling of fear! You just can't. That's a basic instinct in humans. But the problem that you're facing that this fear has developed and became a (Phobia).. A phobia from everything surrounding you.. Look dear, you have every right to be scared;. About yourself, your family, your boyfriend, your studies, your life, from God... Just everything.. But don't let that be an obstacle in your life, make it a motive, take advantage of it in order to over come this fear. I was once just like you but thank God I've over come that by the support of my family, friends and most of all God.. Be fearless from everything but God, take him on YOUR side so that when you're in trouble you shall find him beside you.. For instance God: Make him a motive for you to make good deeds in your life and do good stuff that shall make him happy from and reward you later on in your life instead of drinking and doing messy stuff in your life.. You only live once! Don't ruin it.. Wishing you all the best of luck.

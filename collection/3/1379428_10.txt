it was actually complied in pieces prior to that. But to answer your question better, the reason is because many of the early believers were illiterate so the majority relied on memory techniques that allowed them to remember at a much better rate than we do. Also, that's the reason Jesus used parables. By relating His teaching to an easily-remembered and relational format His disciples were able to remember the gist of His lessons and apply them to life. . . See, the purpose of the Bible isn't to read it ands say, "What a fascinating piece of literature," or "What a piece of tripe," or even to read it as strict history. the purpose is to read it and to ask the Holy Spirit to identify how it applies to life. That means it must be read from a much different perspective than just reading the words. It also explains why unskilled illiterates such as Peter, John and others were able to record their thoughts in such clear detail (Mark wrote Peter's dictated accounts in the Gospel of Mark; John apparently learned to read and write at some point)

They're probably homing pigeons.  In fact, I was wondering if your neighbor is on my bowling team.  This guy on my bowloing team is Mexican and he keeps pigeons because he enters them in contests.  They are homing pigeons and I think they are timed on how long it takes them to come back or something.

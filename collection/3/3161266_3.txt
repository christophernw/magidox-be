I'm a teacher and I really, truly love my students. I don't get mad very often, but here is what has made me mad this year:. . I teach in a private school with very disciplined and highly motivated students. These kids are "on their way" to Stanford, Harvard, etc. I gave a few high school students an A- ... and a couple of them went beserk. One of the girls started sobbing. One of the boys dropped to his knees, begging for an A. Another girl sent her parents in to beg me to change her grade, and they tried to give me an expensive gift as a bribe (which I refused) That made me sad for the kids, but also a bit mad. What is wrong with an A- these days?. . The next quarter I calculated their grades on a weekly basis, so they could bring up their grades...and everyone ended up being very happy.. . Another thing that REALLY makes me mad: I have one student who didn't show up for a concert (he's in a musical performance group) That made me furious, because he didn't tell me he wasn't coming. It also brought his grade down to a C, which he will be upset about in a few weeks.... . Other than these issues, it's just great to be with my students, and we have a great time together.

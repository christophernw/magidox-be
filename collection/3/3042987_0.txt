Assuming you are talking about video games, and that it is not a computer hardware issue (you aren't going to make top spot on a slow computer/'net connection), the best way to improve reaction time is through practice, LOTS of practice. . . But not just any practice. Play against the best you can. Playing against mediocre players only boosts your abilities to a mediocre level. Also, buy some high-quality headphones, so that you can hear the direction people are coming in (for first-person shooters), as well as using visual references. But the main things is just a lot of practice, and being so comfortable with certian moves that you do them for a given situation without thinking.

Food that is truly organic (and a lot of what is on your grocery store shelves is questionable), requires that you grow smaller fields, rotate your crops, and generally that you produce much less food than factory farms.  Think 10-20 acres, instead of 1000-2000 acres.  Additionally, truly organic farms value diversified crops.  Your conventional corn at the store comes from a farm that grows corn--  thousands upon thousands of acres of corn.  This creates issues with the crops, and isn't really good for the land, but it's a cheap way to grow corn.  An organic farm generally grows many different fruits and vegetables.  . . Now, back to my statement at the beginning.  Much of what you see in the stores now that is certified organic does not contain pesticides, but it is still grown in a factory setting.  So, that's why the prices are cheaper now than they were ten years ago.  But it is also why the quality is not as good now.. . If you really want a quality product for less expensive than what you're paying in the grocery store, find a local farmer.  Many of them are not certified organic but are using organic methods.

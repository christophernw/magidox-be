The best way to learn to speak good englich enough to communicate well, is to do several things, first mix with people who speak english well, and who are keen to teach you, and correct you, there are many audio tapes and discs that you can play over and over and repeat, there are great childrens books that sound out the words and also come with a cassette tape, so you can hear the words as you read, and even reading by pictures.. However most TAFE's have classes , where they teach migrants English as a second language, they are wonderful classes, i am a tutor in a class where this happens, ESL classes.. E= English, S= second, L=language.. You will meet many others who, just like you want to learn to speak, write and communicate better.. You also meet new friends.. You can get special fees , and other help , by going to your nearest TAFE and enquiring.. you can also advertise in local papers for a tutor, home tutors don,t cost too much.. Good luck. Sandy T

Easter Facts (my parents & pastor didn't tell me). . 1 Neither the Bible nor secular history tells us the time of the Resurrection. (Not even the day of the week.). . 2 We have God's Word for what days are Holy (to Him) and we know that the NT does NOT say to celebrate Easter (nor does it tell us God wants us to celebrate Christmas).. . 3 We know that God has NEVER tolerated paganism mixed-in with His worship - it is an abhorrent abomination to Him.

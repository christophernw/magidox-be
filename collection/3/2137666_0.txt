In Sims2 the sims are able to age and they have aspirations that they have to fulfill. The adults have babies, which grow into toddlers, which grow into children, then teens, adults, and elders, and then they die. You choose whether you want your sim to have an aspiration to make money, have a family, date, gain knowledge, or make friends. Basically, its much better.

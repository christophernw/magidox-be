You ever notice how their campaigns are . "for education". "for the environment". "for the little guy". . But they never explain "what for" means.  What it normally means is an attorney is going to get rich, a business is going to be regulated, and a person with a job is going to get taxed.   But they don't explain thats what "for" means.

Well this certainly explains why the relationship between my hubby's stepmom went from bad to worse..... knife given with no coin involved... Hmmmm what do we do with this knife. I just have it put away somewhere. I don't believe his father had anything to do with the gift giving as he was rather frail at the time, but things certainly went bad really really bad until my dear father in law passed, but it was so bad in the how she treated my husband that we moved 2000 miles away while he was ill. (There was nothing we could do for him and she made visiting him at home near impossible for my husband and I wasn't allowed at all. Sorry about this answer but it certainly sheds some light on a bad situation. I think that unless you really want to sever the relationship I would make certain the coin was always presented with it... Good Question here!!!

Sheppards ears will eventually stand up on their own ... there is absolutely, positively no need to monkey with them now.. in fact, "trying" to make them stand now will actually damage the ear from standing up on their own.. . Ear Cropping is not an option for sheppards and any vet willing to do it should be reported. There are certain breeds (Dobies, Pits, etc.) that have their ears cropped but that is because their ears aren't naturally defined to stand.. . I've raised 8 GSDs, so I have experience with this and a previous posters is correct, although very rare, there is a chance that one ear may never stand but to me, that only gives the dog character!!!. . Best advice is to just leave them be... cropping, binding, taping, tying, etc is not going to do what you want it to do and only damage your dog anyway!!. . Good Luck.... . ~ Lisa

The war is far from over. How can anyone declare a war is over when the people that American soldiers are fighting are so opposed to us. As for why gas prices are high that's easy. They are that high because we have no choice but to pay for it. We are the consumers and if we are willing to pay over $3.00 per gallon the oil companies will charge that.

The person who is saying this is so full of himself /herself that they think they are a real prize and that the person they are talking to is not rated a "10" ( by the way they think of themselves as a 20 ). They are telling the other person that if they can impress / turn them on they would  be raise up from a 9 to a 10 on their self impose rating system which is very egotistical of this snob.

You need to understand what is happening to you.  If you really hate the world, are you suffering from a clinical depression?  Really look at yourself and how you are feeling, kinda losing energy?  Sleeping too much or not enough?  Losing interest in your usual things like books or studies?   Go and see a doctor and talk about it.  Good Luck!

The main difference between cod liver oil and fish oil is that cod liver oil is high in vitamin A and D and as the name suggest is extracted from the liver of cod fish.. . you should go for fish oil if you are out in the sun alot.. but if you are not or live in a place where its really cold and less sunshine, then you should go for cod liver oil as it will provide you with Vitamin D that you are supposed to have form the sun.. . thats the only difference, both contain omega-3 so no worries about that...

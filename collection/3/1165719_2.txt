Enjoy the food, the dancing, the company--whatever's on offer more than the alcohol. You shouldn't have to get completely blitzed to have a good time. Have a couple of drinks, get buzzed, drink plenty of water and make sure you get plenty of sleep. If it's the party of the year, why get so drunk that you can't actually enjoy it?

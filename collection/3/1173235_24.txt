Very simple answer really...maybe you can choose a better comparision next time? People ask this a lot or why we dont believe the Tooth Fairy or Santa Claus but if you think about it, you would believe in them also if no one fessed up as to being the one leaving you gifts and money under your pilllow. If as a child your parents told you about Santa, and on Christmas morning you had gifts under the tree, you would naturally believe them right? And then a few years down the road, you catch mom putting the gifts under the tree, you approach her and she confesses. Then you no longer believe in Santa right?. . Well the same works for God, however..... no one else has come along saying "God didn't create the Universe, I did" or "God didnt answer your prayers, I did" You can still choose not to believe in Him but, then you have no answers to too many questions. A better example for you to ask though would be "Why do you believe in Jesus and not Krishna?" This would be a much more intelligent question and acceptable comparison.

In cases like our current president, I am glad we can only have presidents for 2 terms, however I agree that when a decent one comes in we should be able to keep him/her as long as possible. But could you imagine another 4, 8 or 12 years with Bush? And would you want to take over after him? If we had open terms for presidency I think people would be a little more cautious on their choices of who to vote in...and as the above poster mentioned why do we only have 2 real choices to begin with? I think that we could have an open presidency with regulated evaluations every 2 years, and that there should be more options for ridding a country of a terrible leader. Good question, got me thinking!

I cannot answer this as I am of a western more Christain faith but an avid reader of all spiritual works too and would like to know this myself. It seems like such a smear and a betrayal to those who are true non violent muslims etc that I am continually surprized that they do not speak up in force- beyond the help in understanding and tolerance and social change it would make.

When you start finding ANY excuse to not go to work...it's time to change. I just changed careers after 22 years in the same industry, and it was the best idea I've had in a long time. I'm sooo happy I finally got the nerve to do it. It takes time to start again, but when you look forward to going to work...it's a great feeling.

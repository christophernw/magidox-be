I have been HIV+ for over twelve years and can honestly tell you that I have rarely been sick. I progressed to an AIDS diagnosis a few years back and even still I rarely even catch a cold. Some of the earliest onset of symptoms are flu-like feelings. But that can be a thousand other diseases. Night sweats that soak the sheets through, repeatedly getting candidiasis, swollen lymph nodes, PCP, MAC, and numerous other oppurtunistic infections are more clearer signs of illness.

Get the dog to the vet!  A corneal scratch can cause permanent damage as the cornea is a very thin layer covering the rest of the eye.  There are stains the vet can use to test the damage and  ointments the vet have you administer at home to help the healing process.  This is not something I would fool around with at all without a vet seeing the dog.

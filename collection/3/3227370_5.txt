Ugh.. . what are the alternatives.. . believing in the 'possibility of impossibility'?. . "Should" we extend equal rights to granite, because it's possible that granite has an eternal soul?. . Because science is what it is: an extension of human rationality, an ability to abstract and synthesize knowledge that consistently confirms coherent theories. They might be all lopsided anamoloies.. but what are we supposed to do? believe in something even more absurd?. . Statistics can be damn accurate.

I'm not white...but I remember when I was about 18 I needed a job quick, and I heard they were hiring to pick apples. So I was like "Sure! That will do for now.". I went down and tried to get a job there. I was basically laughed at by the guy doing the hiring. To put it simply, he wasn't going to hire me, because he KNEW that I would demand to be treated with the basic respect that every American employee demands from his employer. . . Americans will do those jobs. But why should an employer hire an American to do the job when he can get away with hiring a person he can basically treat like a slave? Exactly.

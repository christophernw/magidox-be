I would suggest a change of the chairs that you use. Most probably, you are using a chair/seat with a cover made of some synthetic material. See if you can get yourself a change of chairs to something that has a cloth cover - that should help to avoid collection of charges. Also, if possible get a metal chair that directly touches the floor. Any charge developed directly flows to the earth that way. . . However, since this option is not so feasible in a car, maybe you could try putting a piece of cloth over your seats before you use them. This will test your interior decoration skills also. :-)

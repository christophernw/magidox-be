They believe that the bible contains the inerrant truth of God and that Jesus is our high priest and the holy spirit is our intercessor and helper. They don't believe you need to go through a priest to know the will of God or be forgiven or that they would have the power to "excommunicate" anyone from the body of Christ or that you need to belong to the roman catholic church in order to be saved.  They believe the church should be as it was established in Acts. They don't believe in praying to Saints or having a bunch of statues around.

Go to the bank and get a credit card, but not just any credit card.  Get something called a "Secured credit card".  With secured credit cards, a security deposit of a predetermined amount is needed in order to secure the credit card. Generally, the security deposit needs to be of equal or greater value to the credit amount.  You are almost guaranteed to get this type of card even without a job as long as you got the money for the security deposit.  Many people use this type of card to rebuild their credit history and it's good for beginners too.  If you max out the card and can't pay it back, the worst that can happen is you lose the security deposit on the card.

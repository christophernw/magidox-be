I agree with my big Bear Ron. In southern region, it's hotter because its nearer the equator. Baguio is the coolest place in the philippines since its in a higher elevation and belongs to the mountain province in the northern part. December, January and February are the coolest months for us Filipinos but the foreigners may still feel hot for they are not used to our climate and weather.

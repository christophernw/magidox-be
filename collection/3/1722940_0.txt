cells obtain oxygen through diffusion. Nutrients are obtained by the golgi complex or the endoplamic reticulum, as they deliver nutrients to other cells. Nutrients can also pass through the membrane by diffusion, which is the way small moleucles pass through a selectively membrane. High concentrations of things flow to low concentrations of things.

Water flows into the oceans, but not out. That freshwater flowing in carries minerals in many forms, but we generally group them together as "salt." Since no liquid water flows out of the oceans, the salt doesn't leave. Water vapor, however, does, leaving behind a higher concentration of "salt," which you can more easily distinguish by its taste.

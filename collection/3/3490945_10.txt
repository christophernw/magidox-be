I am also experiencing these kind of thoughts manytimes. I think this is a kind of negative thinking. One advice I got from a spiritualist is that we doubt that which is positive and we don't doubt that which is negative. So his advice is (whenever you have a doubt) "Doubt the negative, accept the positive" or "Doubt the doubt".

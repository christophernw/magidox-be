I blame this on groups like the "neo nazi's" and "kkk", they have masked racism with what they claim is white pride. I am white and am proud of my european heritage, but I understand peoples feelings about these groups. They are not standing for anything good. If a group wants to come together and celebrate white pride (or northern european pride) I am all for it, as long as no one is claiming superiority or belittling other races.

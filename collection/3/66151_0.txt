It may seem that way because it makes the media here.  Stories from other countries don't make the news here as often and this can give the erroneous belief that the US has more serial killers.  Its the same thing when people say that all serial killers are white men.  This is a fallacy promoted by the media.  That theory was blown to bits the the snipers on the east coast!

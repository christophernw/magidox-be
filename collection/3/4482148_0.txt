Pure ethnics will likely disappear in time, but strains always resurface (it's called recurrent). As for the language, no it cannot merge. There will always be people that don't move from where they were born, that are not mixed into the global net and that don't have the slightest interest in what is happening outside their universe. Look at the US, most have no idea of how Japanese people live, still we're talking about advanced interlinked societies.

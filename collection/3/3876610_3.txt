Talk to the school counselor about this.  Tell him/her that it is creeping you out and you have tried to explain it to this person.  Let them handle it.  If it continues, get your folks involved.  I have worked with retatrded people and I thank you for being so patient with this person, a lot of people are meant to others who are different.

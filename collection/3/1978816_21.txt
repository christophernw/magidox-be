Are you really as silly as this question makes you sound??? I doubt it, and your attempt at arguement is off the wall. And what the heck are you talking about Day 5/Day 6...do you really believe that the Earth was created in 7 literal days???? Gee, you have a great ability to turn a blind eye to knowledge. Must be wonderful.

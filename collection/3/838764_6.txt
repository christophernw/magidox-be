i think its because when you're in the dark, your eye's pupils are wide open (so you can see without much light). But when you go into bright light, your pupils dont need to be open very wide (because there is so much light). Too much light hurts your eyes, and sneezing makes you close your eyes, so it is your body's natural reaction.

It's very difficult to do unless you have to proper equipment and it takes 3-4 hours to do one gallon of water. My husband installs distillers, the one gal. that goes in the kitchen and the 6, 8, and 12 gallon. If you're interested feel free to email me and I'll put you in contact with his distributor.

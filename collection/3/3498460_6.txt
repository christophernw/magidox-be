In my opinion a best friend is not necessarily the best of all of your friends. Best can be defined in many different ways. I have many very close friends and they are all very different and a better friend for some specific situations and not others. I believe a best friend is a "staple" friend, meaning they are always there for you and you know you can talk to them about anything. A best friend is someone you know will be there for the rest of your life, one you have surpassed challenges with and it has merely strengthened your relationship. Ultimately, it is up to you what criteria you use to determine friendship quality but just remember that a "best friend" is one that will always be there for you!

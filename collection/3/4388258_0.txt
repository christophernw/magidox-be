Try supplement your weight training with a good cardio training. If you are constantly lifting weights then you are going to gain muscle mass. use higher reps and lower weight maybe try a circuit training program. Try not weighing yourself after a workout because the muscles swell from the blood and water giving you a false reading also try and go a week or two between weigh in's and weigh first thing in the morning.

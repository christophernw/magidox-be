You're either bored, stressed, or sometimes happy.  Some people are emotional eaters which means they eat when they're not hungry because they get overly excited, stressed, depressed, angry, happy, etc...just put in an emotion and I guarantee you'll find someone who eats when they're feeling that way.  . . When you're not hungry...ask yourself why you just grabbed whatever snack you just did BEFORE EATING IT, and learn to recognize what prompts you to reach for food.

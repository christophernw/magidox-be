High School was a lot of fun for me. I probably had a little bit to much fun. I would if I where you study hard, and take care of all your school work before you worry about social activities. The next four years will have a huge impact on the rest of your life, whether or not you go to college, what kind of job you ultimately end up with maybe even lead you to the military, who knows. The best way to have the most options is to get good greats and get involved, play sports, join clubs, make friends and most importantly have fun while your doing it all.

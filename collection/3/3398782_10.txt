To be a Christian means that you accept on faith that Jesus was/is the Son of God, and that He was sent to Earth by God to  show God's love and to die for us, taking away the sins of those who believe in Him. You do not have to belong to or follow the doctrine of any denomination to be Christian.. Too often, people professing to know God better than you do will tell you what to believe about war, gays, Social Security, or any other topic.  They say that you need to think like they do to be Christian.  They are liars.

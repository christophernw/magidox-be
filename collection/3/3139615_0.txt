Candida albicans, a naturally occurring strain of yeast, occupies a place in the normal microbial ecology of the human intestinal environment, as an organism responsible for the neutralization of certain species of harmful gut bacteria. Candida albicans yeast is found in low concentrations in healthy intestinal systems, where it performs its normal, health promoting functions assisting in the maintenance of ideal intestinal flora levels. Candida albicans yeast can however easily proliferate out of control do to the prevalence of health undermining factors so common in our modern world. Candida infection can be successfully treated, but a rational approach to candida treatment must start with a healthy diet and certain life-style modification in most cases.

I think efw has provided a most comprehensive answer, but seeing as this is my home territory I'd add my two pence worth.. . I'd say Stalingrad and Kursk were more important in WW2 than either D-Day and the Western Campaign because of the shear numbers involved. The Red Army wrote down most of the German forces, the actions were on a much bigger scale. No disrespect to the Western Allies.. . My view would be that the Tet Offensive in Vietnam was more important than any other battle in the Vietnam War. Walter Kronkite said that the war might now be unwinnable and that had a massive impact on US public opinion which eventually led to the US withdrawal, so Tet, while a tactical and miltary victory for the US / South Vietnam, was a strategic victory for the North. It should be noted that it didn't do them much good. Although Vietnam generally goes down as a loss for the US, it did enable the Tiger Economies of Asia to kick in - before the Communists could get a grip and now the ecomomy of Vietnam is enslaved to capitalism, and not to thier advantage either!. . I've stuck to the 20th Century here, so my vote for the most important battle would be The Battle of Britain. RAF Fighter Command holds of the Luftwaffe, and persuades Hitler not to bother invading the UK after all, buying time to build up, buy time for the Russians, and for the US to get involved.

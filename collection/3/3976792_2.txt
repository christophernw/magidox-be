It goes back to the olden days where teles were powered by shite, roughly a decent size turd would power the tele for 3 days. Until the companies decided they could make money by charging 50p to watch your tele and so all the new teles were fitted with a component which wouldn't allow teles to be powered by shite anymore. Oh ... if you come across a shite powered tele 1 could easily fetch up to 2 grand on E-bay.

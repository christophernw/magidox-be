Bleaching and using a hair thinner is the best way to go. With waxing, you have to wait for it to grow out slightly before you can re-wax it again and then you'd have little lip pricklies growing back in the meantime. Hair trimmers/thinners can be bought at places like Walgreens, along with the facial hair bleach.

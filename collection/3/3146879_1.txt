there is no place on earth that there is no danger, in the north you got snow storms, temperate zones like cali and ten and others got either earthquakes or tonadoes. the topics like the caribbean got hurricanes and with hurricanes there is flooding, high speed winds. and lets not forget about volcanoes, tidal waves and the list goes on. no place on earth is safe i would say.

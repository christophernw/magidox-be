The term derives from two Greek words  "a" and "gnosis" which translate as "the opposite/against/un-/non-" and "to know" respectively.. . Gnostics in the bible were ones who sought, not to know science) but to know as much as they could about God.. . Literally then, an a-gnostic is one who, unlike an a-theist (who is against God), is one who wishes not to know anything about God.  However, in popular definition an agnostic who does not know what to believe about God.

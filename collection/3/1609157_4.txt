the Bible teaches that he was lonely and enjoyed talking to Adam and Eve in the cool of the evening.  He created us to praise and worship him which appears to have fallen away.  Remember the ark that was to purge humans the rains fall...they can prove this happen archaelogically even in history of non believers.  Then God made the symbol that he would never wipe mankind off the face of the earth by rain?  . I'm not sure what your going for.  But according to the near life experience books on christianity I've read when people die they experience this being of total love.   Of love so encompassing that it completes them.  In fact most are sad they came back from this.  Imagine a being rejoicing in the light, the spirit, the beauty, the grace, the fellowship of pure spirts of saints and the power of a trillion waterfalls and suns now wouldn't you want to spend an eternity with that?

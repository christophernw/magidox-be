Mardi Gras (French for Fat Tuesday) is literally the last day before Lent, Ash Wednesday.  It is celebrated as the last chance to indulge before Lent begins and many Catholics fast.  In New Orleans, it goes on for a week or more with parades, parties, and much merriment--even in spite of all that Hurricane Katrina has done there.  Mardi Gras is offically tomorrow.

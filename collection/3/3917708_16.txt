First grade teacher in Ft. Worth, Texas.. Her name was Mrs. Fretridge. Probably about fifty or so at the time. . She would have been ....well, I don't know what .... fired?...jailed?...sued? if it had been 2006 instead of 1968.. She was the school marm from hell, with the tower of red hair, pointy framed glasses and the attitude that children must be disciplined through severe physical punishments. . I would have to walk to her desk in front of the class and hold out my hands for a good smack from her ruler across the knuckles.. Dunce cap? I wish.. I remember being locked within the dark cloakroom for several hours at a time.. In the playground, during a dodge ball game, I had a disagreement about whether or not I'd been hit. . Suddenly she was on me, screaming and grabbing my small arms and then she swung me through the air so I landed hard on the concrete.. I told her during a test that I felt sick and in anger, she grabbed me and made me stand in front of her desk. I said, "please, I need to lie down". I started to cry and then I suddenly had diarrhea come out.. She rounded the desk and smacked my butt hard, causing the diarrhea to explode out of the top of my pants.. I think that after that, there was a lot of shouting and laughter and I was picked up under my arms and thrown out of the classroom.. . I also remember she would just take me to the burly principal so he could put me over his knee with the wooden paddle.. . Eventually I just lost it, stuck some kid with my pencil and I got expelled and put on some drug according to her recommendation. . It was monsterous.. I feel like a veteran of the age before liable and litigation.. Thank God little kids don't have that anymore.

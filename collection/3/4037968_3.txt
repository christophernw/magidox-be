hi for example the clients contact book should always be kept safe.NOT for just anyone to pick up and read, this book contains information about the client  ie medication they take, what care is done for the client what time you arrive and left.also personal things like full body wash soak feet, cream legs, help with hearing aid, and also what u gave them for breakfast .... i would not like any one to just pick up my contact book (if i had one) and read what the carers do when they in my home. the contact book is just like a diary... hope this helps hun good luck

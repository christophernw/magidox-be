forensic chemists conduct many different analyses including tests to determine purity of drugs, drug concentrations in bodily fluids such as blood and urine, analysis of accelerants used in arson, trace analysis (glass, paint components, fibers, hairs, etc.), analysis of unknown substances and so on.. . These analyses can be used in conjunction with other evidence to either incriminate or exonerate suspects, determine severity of sentencing criminals and even to rule out foul play all together.

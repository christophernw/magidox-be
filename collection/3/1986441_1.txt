The theory that electrons revolve around nucleus of an atom is a simplification of the actual electron cloud theory, and does not correspond to the real world model.It was actually proposed long before the electron cloud theory, and is still taught in lower grades because it is simple and does model the actual atom, albeit very very crudely. The actual theory is very advanced. Check out : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry for some basics. Depending on your age, you might want to read a textbook on the subject if you are really interested.

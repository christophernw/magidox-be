I don't see evolution (with all the connotations the Christian church has given it) as disproving God because both the Biblical account and Darwin and Wallace's statements on natural selection -- the technical term for evolution -- contain a process.  Between you and me, it's easier to have faith in God creating Adam and Eve out of dust than it is to believe that their descendants developed over miollions of years from a "lower" form.  . . It seems many people get confused by viewing evolution as a theory of creation rather than development.  That's often the perspective of people who say "evolution proves God".  By providing a studiable (is that a word?) and testable process of life's development and not its creation, God should appreciate the proof of His handiwork that some people choose to be blind to see.

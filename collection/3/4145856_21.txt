I don't know what your definition of "immigrant" is, but I was born in the USA and so therefore I am NOT an immigrant in the USA.  You are the ignorant one to even state this!  No, we are NOT ALL IMMIGRANTS!  Somewhere down the ancestry line, yes, we all had immigrant ancestors, but no, those of us born here are NOT immigrants.  This has been explained in this forum so many times by now that I cannot believe you are still coming up with this BS.  My dear, I think that you are the one who had better open up your eyes!  And, the reason Mexicans are the main illegal immigrants that get noticed is because they are the largest group of immigrants and also because they recently drew the most attention to themselves with their May1st marches and demonstrations and protests - by doing this, they LITERALLY DEMANDED TO BE NOTICED!  I certainly hope that there is hope for you to climb out of your cave or out from under the rock you live under one of these days.

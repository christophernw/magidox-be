After 3 hours of dental torture, and the dentist use every tool before crushing a compacted tooth, I had pieces still left in my gum.  It took about a month for all the comeout (like a splinter does). Be careful, try to spit them out as they come out.  And watch your tongue, I lasserated (cut/sliced) my tongue on one sharp piece that was trying to come out.

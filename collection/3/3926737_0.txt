Do you love this house?  Do you absolutely have to have it?  If so, get yourself an attorney immediately.  . . What I've seen happen in cases like this is that you get an appraisal and the seller gets an appraisal.  If they're not too far apart you may be able to negotiate a purchase price somewhere between the two amounts.  . . If you're not able to live with that then, depending on how the appraisal portion of the agreement was written, you may be able to file a lawsuit to force the seller to close with the appraisal price you obtained.  But be aware that this will take quite a bit of time and will probably end up creating some significant legal fees.  If you win you may be able to recover the legal fees from the seller but that is not a sure thing.. . If you don't absolutely have to have the house then I suggest that you still get a lawyer so you can cancel the contract and get back all of your deposit.

It is very hard to tell someone you are close to that a loved one is dying of cancer.  Sometimes the best way is to let the person themselves do the telling... if they are unable to or want you to do the telling then the best way is to just come out with it.  Be sympathetic of course, but don't mince words.  Dragging it out is more painful than being told point-blank.

As an athiest I think I speak for all of us when i say I really don't care what you think--and I don't care if you care what i think. If burniing in hell for eternity means i don't have to spend a minute with people like you, I'll gladly take that choice. I don't care, and you should stop worrying about what we think--- we couldn't care less about your religion. Keep it to yourselves--stop trying to prove anything. we don't need proof--we just don't care.Thank you.

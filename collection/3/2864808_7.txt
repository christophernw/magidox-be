okay these are all good answers but one woman said the naimals are non consenting. but i used to work on a dairy farm and the cows liked to be milked. they would fight for a spot to get milked and cross the road to be milked and they seemed to enjoy it. but yes, breastmilk is for little humans it is natural. but you won't catch me breastfeeding my next kid sorry.. . have a good day.. ~Rikki

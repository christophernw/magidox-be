Dude, I live in Canada (Northwestern Ontario) where it is Freakin COLD. Anyway try buiIding a kennel outside, we built a kennel with an insulated dog house for our dog and she gets plenty of exercise. Or if you prefer use a dog run (clothes line works) Try just playing around in the house. Let's not forget that dogs are animals and are better equip to be in the cold then we are.

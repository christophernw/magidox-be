When u wake up falling out of bed.. Hurt urself while brushing.. At the end of ur toilet sitting u remember u forgot to get toilet paper.. Shower out of order.. Searching for car keys when u r late.. Traffic.. Get fired.. No fuel in the car to return home.. Girl friend calls up to say she wants to break up.. Credit card bill statement .. . No food when u r hungry for difnner.. . If all this thing happen on a one day.. we can say that person doesn't worth living.  He doesn't belong here.

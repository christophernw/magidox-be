I believe the first ever AIDS that happend... Was in West Africa, where a man was bitten (in 1959), I think a chimp (not %100 sure) well they have a SIDS, which is exacly like AIDS, but it affects them... He didn't know he had it, and had unprotective sex, and that is the first thing that got it started to spread back then...

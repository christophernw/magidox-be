An egg cell in an ovule of a flower may be fertilized by a sperm cell derived from a pollen grain produced by that same flower or by another flower on the same plant, in either of which two cases fertilization is said to be due to self-pollination (autogamy); or, the sperm may be derived from pollen originating on a different plant individual, in which case the process is called cross pollination. OR we can say. Pollen of one plant is transferred to the female part of the same plant or another plant with the same genetic makeup is self pollination.. Fertilization by the transfer of pollen from an anther of one plant to a stigma of another is cross pollination

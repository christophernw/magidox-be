If you aren't a college student, then the school needs to have already been in contact with your mom.  She would have to sign papers.  If you were going to be retained, your teachers would have to create what is called an Individual Learning Plan (ILP).  Your mom would have been part of the process.  I think if you really weren't going to graduate you would already know it.

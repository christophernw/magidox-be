You cant say something like that without facts to back it up..  No liberal in their right mind thinks it is a sin to be rich. I personally just feel that since I have so much I should give back to those who dont have as much. It is confusing to some of us, why some people can just sit back and let others suffer when they could do something about it..  I would rather use my money to help someone who needs help than to buy more shallow materialstic crap that I dont need.

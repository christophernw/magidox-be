WHY NOT CONSIDER BEING A FLIGHT ATTENDANT ALSO...TEXAS HAS SEVERAL LARGE AIRPORTS...JUST APPLY ONLINE AT DIFFERENT AIRLINES.....IT ALSO HELPS IF YOU ARE BILINGUAL.  BUT IF YOU ARE SET ON BEING A COCKTAIL WAITRESS ON A BOAT YOU SHOULD SEARCH CRUISELINES ONLINE THEY USUALLY HAVE WEBSITES TOO...JUST CLICK ON CAREERS AND A JOB APPLICATION SHOULD COME UP IF THEY ARE HIRING.

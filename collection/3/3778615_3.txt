"O' ye that believe, take not Jews and Christians as your friends and protectors" (Qur'an, Surah 5:54)". . "Fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them. Seize them. Beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them" (Qur'an, Surah 9:5). . blah blah blah. There are tonnes more quotes like this. Loving Muslims exist but they must reinterpret or flatly ignore a great amount of instruction from the Qu'ran to reach such a state. The Qu'ran really lends itself much easier to those inclined to violence. Enormous liberties are required to interpret the New Testament the same way, hence the general ridicule and loss of credibility for violent Christians.. .

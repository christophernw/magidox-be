I have for years now (i'm 23)...most guys think its hot...that's why i started..an ex of mine asked me to. Now i do it just becasue its easier just to shave it all then to carefully trim and get it just right. Also, it seems more hygenic to me and i love being smooth. There is nothing nastier than seeing little pubes all over someones bathroom or stuck to the soap when you are in someone elses house, and this way i know that will never be a factor in my house b/c i have none! personally i think girls with pubes are gross, it just looks...dirty, like they arent clean. . . and YES, you can get it totally smooth by shaving if you use a good razor like  the mach 3 turbo.yes i use a guy's razor, they work best.

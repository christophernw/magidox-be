In anatomy, a meniscus is either of two parts of the human knee. The knee contains a lateral meniscus and a medial meniscus, and both are cartilaginous tissues that provide structural integrity to the knee when it undergoes tension and torsion. The plural of 'meniscus' is 'menisci'. The menisci are also known as 'semi-lunar' cartilages - referring to their half-moon shape - a term which has been largely dropped by the medical profession, but which led to the menisci being called knee 'cartilages' by the lay public.. . In sports and orthopedics, people will sometimes speak of "meniscus surgery," or a "torn meniscus," and be referring to an injury to one of these two pads.. . In another context, a meniscus (plural: menisci, from the Greek for "crescent") is a curve in the surface of a liquid and is produced in response to the surface of the container or another object. It can be either concave or convex. A convex meniscus occurs when the molecules of the liquid repel the molecules of the container or object. This may be seen between mercury and glass in barometers. Conversely, a concave meniscus occurs when the molecules of the liquid attract those of the container. This can be seen between water and glass. Surface tension acts on concave menisci to pull the liquid up, and on convex menisci to pull the liquid down. This phenomenon is important in transpirational pull.. . The meniscus must be taken into account in order to obtain an accurate measurement of the level of liquid. As is obvious from the diagram at right in which a and b respectively contain the same volume of different liquids, if the meniscus is concave, the bottom is read on the container's scale. If the meniscus is convex, the top is read.

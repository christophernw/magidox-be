OOOOH, this is a tough one.. You will NEVER be able to convince these people who are the most important to you)that it's ok. Bottom Line.All you have control over is how you are able to handle their possible rejection. You can not change this about yourself, but you can change your expectations. If you tell them, be confident in yourself and your conviction. 16 is awfully young to live apart from your family, but often, that's what happens. Is it to tough to keep this to yourself for now, until you're able to comfortably live on your own, as the "lesser of the 2 evils?" Not saying gay is evil, believe me. I'm saying that living under the same roof with intolerant folks may be worse than buying some time quietly.. I am sorry you have to deal with this at such a vulnerable age.You're only 16 once. Enjoy it as much as you can

Perhaps the simplest and most logical reason is; all of the other stations are extremely biased to the left. As becomes very evident when you see the demonizing of Fox on all of them. They are quite used to having absolute control of the airwaves and don't care for any interlopers.  Oddly, the blogs seemed to come into play about the same time Fox did. The absolute hold on broadcasting had finally been broken.

well you could graph the data on a line graph, which would give you a good visual picture of any differences in the data (example, if one line is way higher than the other, etc.) but that wont actually tell you Statistical Significance. you might want to get a program called SPSS, it does all sorts of data testing for you, and you can run t-tests or ANOVAs to see if your data is significant in the statistical sense. i forget how to actually do the calculations tho, sorry. :(

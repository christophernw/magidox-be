Death is not an end....an experience for me in 1990 brought with it awareness.. . It was like going HOME after being gone so long I'd forgotten I left.. . God is LOVE. It is beyond conditional words here..... . Breathing causes spiritual amnesia.. . Your body is WHAT you are IN, not WHO you are.. . God is HOW you are able to BE you.. . God is HOW you are able to recognize your reflection, when actually you cannot see it.. . God is HOW you recognize yourself in photos, even when you forget everyone else that you CAN see for yourself.. . God is everything AND nothing at all.. . Welcome to this temporary conditional reality, where you forget yourself, so you can pretend whatever you choose all over again. . . God forgets no one, even if we forget ourselves.. Tangible is temporary.

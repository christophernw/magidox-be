k listen to me i just started working on my abs and i basically have a six pack. You must not have any fat on ur abs, or very little. Crunches will not burn the fat off they will make ur abdominals stronger. So jog, bike, run. To burn the fat off your stomach. And do 100 crunches a day. Crunches not situps. Situps are bad for your back and crunches work easier. If your fat it will take longer because u have fat on your stomach covering up your abs. If your around 150 it will take bout a month to get a sixpack

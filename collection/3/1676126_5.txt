If, by the word "powerful" you refer to an empire's lasting affect on the present day, the Roman Empire is the best choice.  There are so many aspects of our world today can be traced back to them, from law, science, warfare and so many other fields.  There have been many other very powerful empires in the past such as the Ottomans, Mongols, and Chinese but their affect on the current world can not be compared to the Roman Empire, for good or bad.  The British Empire would be a distant second, mainly because they owe so much to the Romans to begin with.  Also the United States may in the future take the place of the Romans if you loosen the definition of empire.  The United States is by no means a empire.

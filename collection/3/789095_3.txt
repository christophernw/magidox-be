I think it can co-exist if Christians are willing to recognize their mythology as mythology.  There's plenty to be learned from the Bible, as well as other mythologies, even if it isn't 100% true.  Jesus, or the people who wrote about him, said some pretty good stuff no matter what your religious beliefs may be.  I mean loving people and helping others are good ideas whether Jesus really lived, died, and raised from the dead or not.

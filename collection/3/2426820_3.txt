i would go back to the do not call site it should tell you your rights , but there is also a time factor with that it , if i remember right may take up to 3 months for everyone to get the info on there system , also if the company is in a diffrent country it may be hard to track down and with a lot of companies out sorcing to places like packastan it may take even longer , make sure you write down who called when and about what , and ask if they work for a company that is under contract they may not give you a full name but an employee number so you can address the issue with the head company or the do not call people

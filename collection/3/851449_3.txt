You should take your dog to the vet to make sure the dog doesn't have intestinal worms.  Sometimes this can cause dogs and cats to lose weight. Also, spaying or neutering your dog can help him or her gain weight.  There are also special diet foods on the market for thin dogs. I know someone who gave their dog fried chicken and human fatty foods. Please DO NOT try that. It causes worms and other health problems for your dog. But, you can even try boiling chicken liver or cook ground beef with rice to fatten your dog up.  You can even mix liver, rice, and beef to your dogs food. Your dog will love it! My dogs were disgusting when I had to do this, they hogged it down! lol! Boiled chicken livers and rice is safe to feed your dog. My vet told me it was actually good for them because I'd feed it to my Jack Russell Terriors when they were pregnant to give extra iron. I hope that fattens your pup!

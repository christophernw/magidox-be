Are you kidding me?  You get to spend the extra dollars on your entertainment at the pub and strip joint (where I know you're giving those girls money), and she gets a lousy 5 bucks a day to keep house?!  If she's taking care of your kids too, I'm really going to be disappointed in you.  Why do people get married if they can't combine and share everything.  Why is it that there's "your money" and "her money."  The whole concept of marriage is a "we thing."  Cut her loose now and spare her the rest of her life living in misery at your mercy.

Phone up the Royal college of Surgeons: there are some overseas exams these days. However there is a HIGH failure rate in these. You are advised to go on the official MRCS courses...where I will teach you!!!. Brush up your anatomy and physiology.. For the viva there is a good book by David Lowe on the Pathology.. Good Luck

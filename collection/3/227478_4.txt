I have asked that question for years. Babies surely aren't sinners, and that original sin thing, if you can prove THAT'S the truth, I would take another look, but, I always thought baptism should be a life choice, and although my Catholic family baptized me as a baby, I became a Christian and decided for myself that was what I wanted. Lots of debate there, my Christian cousin baptized her 3, but I think it was to please the folks. Also, there is no pergatory in the bible. Not even the Catholic Bible.

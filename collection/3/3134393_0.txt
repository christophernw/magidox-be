I saw a programme about a Palestinian and Jewish school recently. What depressed me was the entrenched views of the kids. Neither side saw the other side as even remotely human. It's almost inevitable that when the Israeli kids join the army a few years later, that they will murder (yes, murder) other kids without a flicker of remorse. Equally depressing is the fact that Palestinian kids would do the same when they become young adults.

Go to an on-line brokerage site like ETrade, or Scottrade, etc., or do a search (something like"India on-line broker NASDAQ") for a broker near you.  Most if not all U.S. Brokers require a minimum $500 to open an account and a Social Security Number.  Why no S.S. number?  Do they give them out in your country?  If they don't you might be able to open an account using another type of ID.  I would e-mail the broker(s) and see if you can use some form of Government ID or ID number, or maybe using a photocopy or the number on your passport.   If they do (have S.S. numbers in India) than I would say you're SOL ( i.e. not going to be able to get a broker and buy shares on the NASDAQ Market).

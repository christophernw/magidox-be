They are all monatomic molecules and chemically inert (unreactive), except for argon, krypton and xenon. Xenon and krypton are known to show some reactivity in the laboratoryâ€”see noble gas compounds . Recently argon compounds have also been successfully characterised.. . The noble gases' lack of reactivity is due to their having a complete valence shell. They have little tendency to gain or lose electrons. The noble gases have high ionization energies and negligible electronegativities. The noble gases have low boiling points and are all gases at room temperature.. . Because of their unreactivity, the noble gases were not discovered until 1868, when helium was detected spectrographically in the Sun. The isolation of helium on Earth had to wait until 1895. The noble gases have very weak inter-atomic forces of attraction, and consequently very low melting points and boiling points. This is why they are all gases under normal conditions, even those with larger atomic masses than many normally solid elements.

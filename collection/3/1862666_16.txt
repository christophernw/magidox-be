Because going to church and reading your Bible requires much more effort.  You may see a movie once and it's only a couple hours.  Reading the Bible all the way through can take about a month (I've read it cover-to-cover a few times).  Going to church takes about 15 hours out of the week (if you go everytime the door is open).  So, going to church and reading the Bible takes a lot more effort than a lot of people are willing to put into it.

Great horned owls are monogomous.  They remain together for years.  . . "Large species of owls may occupy stick nests built by eagles hawks or ravens, or may nest on the top of a stump or snag, in a niche between diverging branches ina cave or cliff face or in an old building.  Owls often reuse sites...many species use nest boxes"  . .  First of all, birds don't use nests unless they are reproducing...incubating (35 days for GHOW),  or tending to fledglings (up to 3 months for GHOW).  . . You may e looking for a roost if the birds aren't breeding yet.  A roost is a site where an owl spends it's days sleeping.  A typical roost site will have many owls pellets near it.  Depending on where you live they may be breeding.   . . If you want to find this nest go out at dusk and listen for the owls.  The male has a lower hoot than the female.  Try to locate the owls.  . . I hope the information I am providing will be used for an appreciation for these awesome creatures and not something stupid like to kill one.  Bad news...especially in the breeding season.

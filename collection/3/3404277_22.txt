pigs have a cloven hoof - but not the other sign of being kosher, ie, chews its cud.. . also pig is very similar to human ( i believe science is working on heart transplants from pig to human, as well as other organs, too). Would you eat another human (LOL - in a non-sexual way, I mean). Probably not. . . Could be that 'ancient' religions knew something we do not.

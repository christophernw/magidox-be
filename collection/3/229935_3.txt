They would look like someone hasn't slept in a long time or they were dead. When you become increasingly tired your skin around the eyes darkens and it creates an illusion of a sunken eye. The tired, drooping eyelid and accompanied vacant, zonked expression complete the "sunken eye" look. Also, when you die your eyeball sets further back into your head; or when you lose a lot of weight your eyes look kind of scary and bug-like and sunken; see images of people dying of AIDS in Africa for that creepy dark-shadow around the eye, eerie expression.

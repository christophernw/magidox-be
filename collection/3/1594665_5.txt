Not only did the vinegar "cook" the meat but it will also not be as tasty as I think you were going for. It's the acid in the vinegar that turned it white. Some wines will do the same thing. Different meats can handle different timing when marinating. The meat you marinated is not spoiled but I think you'll be very disappointed in its taste. Hope you weren't doing it for company or to impress a prospective boyfriend.

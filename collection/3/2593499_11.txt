That's not true. The democrats are pretty much demographically a slice of America. Most are white, and there are more Hispanic democrats than black ones, because there are more Hispanics than blacks in America. . . If you mean why are more blacks democrats; well, the Republicans haven't done much for them lately, and pretty much haven't since the Civil War. Lincoln, a Republican, freed the slaves, but I don't think he'd recognize todays Republicans as the same party he belonged to.

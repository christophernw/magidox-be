Contact an owner of a racetraack and ask questions.. First, insurance rates are ridiculous I've heard, and you have to have insurance. A local track near my house was built by a farmer on his land.. . Race tracks are being sold all over the USA to developers of housing.. . Don't stop-you are one of a dying type of person. If you have the determination, go for it ! Good luck.

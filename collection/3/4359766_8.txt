It's never a good idea to have people forced into a war they don't want to be in.  I wouldn't want someone who doesn't want to be there watching the back of people who DO want to be there.. . All this is is emotional blackmail.  This guy is saying that if you support the war, it's hypocritical to not support a draft.  That's complete shit.  He's trying to make the US make the choice of either we have a draft or our military pulls immediately out of Iraq.  This is the same guy who introduced a draft bill during the 2004 presidential campaign so that they could use a scare tactic to sway voters to the democrats.  He didn't even vote for his own bill.  He's a politician of the worst sort.

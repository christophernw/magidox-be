I vote on general issues, not necessarily the person.  It just depends.  Democrats are generally FOR abortion, embryonic stem cell research, increasing taxes, leaving Iraq cold turkey and several other issues that I am extremely against.  Therefore, as long as the Republican agenda remains about the same as it is, I will vote Republican.

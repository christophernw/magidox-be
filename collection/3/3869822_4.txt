Because gravity pulls equally in all directions.. As soon as the materials that the earth is made of began to gather together under self-gravity, the center pulled equally in all directions.  As heat from friction and radioactivity made much of the early earth molten, gravity pulled it into the most efficient shape -- a sphere.  Because of the earth's rotation and centrifugal force, it's not quite a perfect sphere -- it bulges a bit at the equator and is slightly flattened at the poles -- but it's simply gravity doing what it does naturally.  It's why all large bodies are in the shape of a sphere.

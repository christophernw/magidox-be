Perhaps because "you people" are independent thinkers. Religion is a human creation.  When the alleged deity(ies) profers some tangible proof of his/her/their existence - something that doesn't rely on one person's story telling, something that doesn't require "faith" - maybe then we will all be able to unite in a "True Religion".  But I'm not going to hold my breath.

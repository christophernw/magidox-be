Many people think that it's either of those four choices, but for me, although I am a teenager myself, I think it's themselves. It's a psychological thing we all go through and it's not the fault of any of other people if they can't understand this phase. We just bump into each other not realizing what we've done and regret each and everything that happened and finally, to break away from the guilt, we blame it to other things.

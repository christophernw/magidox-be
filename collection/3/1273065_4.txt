Sam is right. Some snakes are live bearers, some lay eggs. Many snakes leave the eggs after laying, but some incubate their eggs and are very good protective mothers. However after hatching the young are on their own. You can find lots of books about snakes at your local library, in bookstores(Reptiles mag has a good article this month) or visit www.kingsnake.com. Most snake breeders have in-depth articles on their sites about breeding and care of females and eggs.

find out where your local spiritualist church is. look in to healing. everybody is capable of it, it is not a special power that only a few people poses, it is simply a case of learning how to 'open' that part of your brain to accept spirit is real and healing is real. look on the internet and get a book.. . i suggest looking at web site www.spiritsinc.co.uk then look at ray brown.

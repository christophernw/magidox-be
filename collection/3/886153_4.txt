Religions spread themselves using a system of punishment & reward just like chain letters, they say pass on my message and you'll get something good (heaven) fail to pass on my message and you'll get something bad (hell). . [1] Once the religious meme has parasitised the mind of its host, a religious meme needs to propagate itself. A successful meme will contain instructions for some or all of the following:. . [2] Holy war - convert or kill all unbelievers .. . [3] Intimidation & terrorism - threaten and discriminate against unbelievers.. . [4] Enforced social isolation or even death to apostates. (An apostate is a host which has cured itself of a meme-infection. Apostasy within the community of believers is especially dangerous to the meme because it might encourage meme-resistance in others).. . [5] Fecundism - encourage true believers to breed faster than believers in false memes.. . [6] Censorship - prevent rival memes from reaching potential hosts (a theological doctrine known as 'Error has no rights').. . [7] Disinformation - spread lies about rival memes. Demonise them - the bigger the lies the more likely they are to be believed. The disinformation may even include instructions for the meme to lie about itself!

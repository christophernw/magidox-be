I used to think Richards was cool - he could really do great physical humor. But what he said was pretty wicked, and I'd be surprised if he hasn't lost all his fans.  I would never call a black the "N" word, because it is so obviously derogatory - in every movie about slavery the "N" word is used as the worst insult. I agree with the black people who answered this by saying they wish black people would stop using that word. It really does sound awful no matter who uses it, because IT IS A HATE WORD. I sure hope all prejudice dies with the current generation. There's enough evil in the world as it is.

satan is evil... he was on the hand of god but he became jealous of god.. i have read satan was a very good looking angel but he chose to go against god and his plan.. eve was tempted and took of the apple from the forbidden tree.. and thus forth sin was brought in.. and then they knew they were naked and tried to cover theirselves with fig leaves.. the devil is here to kill , steal and destroy.. the devil can come in sheeps clothing .. and we need to know the bible and try the spirits to see if they are of god...but all of us that believe in the lord jesus christ and strives to live gods will and plans for us.. john 3 16 says whosover beileveth in me shall have everlasting life.. things will not be a bed of roses for us on this earth.. but we must endure to the end and read our bible and stay as close to god as we can.. anyone that seeks the lord they shall find him...and a relationship with god is the most wonderful thing we can have here on this earth....

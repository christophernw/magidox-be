The constant exposure to irritants, tar etc.. causes the alveoli ( the air sacs inside your lungs that expand when you breathe in ) to lose their elasticity...as a result less oxugen is absorbed in these sacs resulting in a shrinking, hardening of these sacs, and a decrease of oxygen intake.  This is why most emphysema patients are on oxygen to help them breathe......This is emphysema

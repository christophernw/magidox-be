My neighbours had a cat that could squeeze through doors like you wouldn't believe. Once, the girl who lived there was climbing through her window because the door was locked or something, and the little white cat stuck her head out through a space in this tiny window. The girl took up a lot of room, and there's this cat head..........it was so cute! A regular Houdini (named Kiki). I suggest you leave your kitten in a closed room when you go out. Try to keep it in one room. It'll eventually get used to staying there.

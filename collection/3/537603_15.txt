It is like the movie "Shriek".. . What is beautiful to one person is a turn -off to another.. . So, for example lets say I really love girls with facial hair...I mean I think they are the bomb!. . And another guy would say that is so disgusting!  He could say that....but for me she is so freakin hot!. . Understand?

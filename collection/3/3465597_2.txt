It probably depends on who is doing the translation.  In Jewish translations, where the name of God is never pronounced, it would simply be written as "God".  There are a few reasons for this. . 1) Jews try to avoid accidently using the name of God incorrectly. 2)  The name of God is never pronounced- in temple times it was pronounced by the High Priest, after an extensive purification ritual, during the service for the day of atonement.  This was the ONLY time it was pronounced.. 3) Hebrew is written without vowels.  Now the problem comes- how should it be pronounced/punctuated?  In temple days they would have had the yearly pronouncement to know this (and the pronouncement was overseen by seniour priests who knew exactly what it should be).  The problem is, that it was never recorded with vowels, and today nobody knows the correct pronunciation.  So, the issue is, how do you punctuate the name made up of the four letters "Yed Hey Vav Hey"?  We don't know.  How do you then transliterate it?  No idea- so therefore, we cannot render it into a translation since it is impossible to translate the word.  (When reciting prayers another word, Adonai, is used, and most hebrew transliterations follow this tradition as it allows the user to follow the service.)

I think it's because they are insecure. It's like they think their question won't get answered unless they are yelling at the top of their lungs. Sort of like the person in a group photo who leans far in to make sure they're in the shot.. . Another thing that's annoying are those who type with no capitals. What's their boggle? . . I think that folks are just rude and lazy, frankly.

Ignore the weird looks, just because they think an expensive dance is an important part of life doesn't mean you should feel that way or that it even is. I went and was bored, not to mention being out the money for the dress/tickets/etc. It can be enjoyable if you love parties, love buying extravagant outfits you'll never wear again, and really like your fellow classmates. If not, a small, casual get together with your real friends is so much better!

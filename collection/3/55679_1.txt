It is an arrestable offence to be found in possession of a lock knife in a public place.  The exception to knives having blades of not more than three inches under Section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 applies only to ordinary folding pocket knives.  A lock knife is an offensive weapon per se and the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959 prohibits the manufacture, sale or possession for sale or hire, of 'flick knives' and 'gravity knives', so you could presumably be charged under either that or Section 1 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953, which prohibits the possession in any public place of an offensive weapon without lawful authority or excuse. What's more, anyone purchasing such a thing from you and walking off with it could be charged with an offence under Section 1 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953. It looks as though you're rather stuck with your collection, I'm afraid.

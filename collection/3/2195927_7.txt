One: find a good mechanic. Two: be as descriptive as possible. Three: if that does not work find another mechanic. . I'm a mechanic by trade, sometimes the problem does not show itself easily. A GOOD professional mechanic should listen to each customer's problem. I've had men tell what the problem was & how to fix it & they were way wrong. Yoou may not know cars, but you do know your car.

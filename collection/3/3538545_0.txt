Fish, amphibians, and reptiles have clear membranes that act as our eyes do-for protection.  This is an evolutionary adaptation so that even during exposure to grit, etc, that requires closing of the membrane, they can still see.  In land animals, the eyelids protect primarily against dryness, as well as windborne dust-this is not required for fish, as the water is constantly bathing the eye.  Even if a fish or amphibian has its eyes "closed", since the membrane is clear, they look open.

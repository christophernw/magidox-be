yes kids getting spanked is bad cause the kid can get a low selfasteem and cause mayhem. the teachers today don't understand that spanking a kid will not change the way he is going to behave it is the kids choice and if he wants to change he will and that's it so if there still kids getting spanked make sure they tell you so you can go to the school and let the teachers know that you can not be spanking my kid okay keebler out peace...

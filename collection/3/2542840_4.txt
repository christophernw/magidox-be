something that always helps me is to just start writing something down on paper...really anything..the first thing that comes to mind. When you're done with that thought, move on and start writing what comes to mind again. Eventually, you'll get your brain back into the habit of writing down your ideas, and hopefully open you up to writing and finishing your works.

In fact, you are FAR more likely to be a victim of violence, including racist hate crime violence at the hands of other blacks.  The second most likely group to commit hate crime violence against you are hispanics.. . But whites waving around a confederate flag....  I'm not saying it never happens.  But, it is so rare that realistically, the chance it will happen to you is zero.  Your chance of being raped, robbed, beaten, murdered or victimized in any way, by white people is neglible.  It's other blacks you have to worry about, chica.

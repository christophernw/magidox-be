You have to soak your beans in water for some time, overnite is best.  Cook them until soft. About 25 minutes in a pressure cooker, or the necessary time in a regular pot (About 2 hours) with enough water to cover.  If the water evaporates, have enough HOT water to refill.  It has to be boiling hot, otherwise it will stop the beans from cooking.. When cooked,  separate most of the liquid if excessive. Have some hot chicken broth ready, about 2 liters, depending on the amount of soup you're making.. Fry some finely chopped onion and some chopped tomatoes.  Let the juices flow and form a lumpy sauce.  You can liquefy this in the blender or use it as is.  Pour the sauce into the beans and season with some salt and pepper, add the chicken broth and now for the secret ingredient.  Get some powdered cummin and add it to the soup little by little, always tasting to make sure you don't over do it.  Let it cool a while before you put in the blender until smooth.If you like spicy, you can add some hot pepper sauce.  Serve with chopped coriander (Cilantro leaves) and finely chopped onion.  Sour cream goes well too.  Hope you like it!

Teacher has a very important role to play in the life of the students. He has to take pains to teach as much best as he can. He has to impart what best he has in him, without any reservations. He also has duty to develop the students' receptive minds considering their tender age particularly for the teachers of schools. Even if young and not exposed much to outside crooked world, the students understand very well whether a teacher is doing his best to impart knowledge or is just serving time. Students get attached to their good teachers for the rest of their life, wherever they are and express their gratitude for their upbringing in the schools by the good teachers.

These people don't know what they're talking about. The only difference between a B.S. and a B.A. is 2 years of foreign language, no matter what your major is. Trust me, my mother-in-law works in student records at our university, and my father-in-law is an art professor. And I worked for two head of department of communication for a total of 4 years, and helped write their section of the course catalog. I had to know these things.

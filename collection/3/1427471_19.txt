when they're finished cooking, put them in a bowl and cover with cold water, the colder the better.... not icy cold though!!! leave them for about 5 minutes, then crack the shells and peeling will be a lot easier. putting them in cold water also prevents that grey ring they get. your eggs should be fine, whichever ones you choose. i find adding salt helps too.

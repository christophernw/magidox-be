I am a tech writer, does that help?. . I was taught the opposite -- hand screw in place until everything dependent on that screw is assembled, then tighten.. . This makes sense in several areas: if you are wrong, it is less effort to take the screw out; some pieces may need more slack than a tightened screw will give; if you put that screw all the way down, you may have a screw that will barely thread in.  Torque is more even when the screws are tightened after all the fastenings are placed.. . And tightening opposites or corner to corner from each other works better than tightening in a 1-2-3-4 line.

Catholics confess their sins to their Father (earthly) in a confessional.  Baptists talk directly to God.. I believe Catholics pray to Mary and call her the Mother of God.  She was the mother of Jesus, and not on his level of importance.. Fathers wear flowing robes.  I've only seen Baptist clergy wear suits, nothing to stand out.. I believe that people pray for dead Catholics to be received in heaven.  Baptists believe we made the decision on earth.. Most churches say prayers by rote (repetition).  Most Baptists make up spur-of-the-moment prayers from the heart.

Try going to a local library, preferably a BIG one, and see if they still use something called microfiche. My library had this back in the 80's and had any newspaper article imaginable. I don't know what they keep that stuff on now, maybe a DVD or CD, but ask them I guarantee you you will find what you are looking for.

I understand how for you it is hard to believe but you have to give people their own space to find their own path to God. I love Jesus and appreciate how he lived his life but I don't believe I need him to get closer to God. I know the truth that works for me as you know the one that works for you. I don't believe Jesus wants me to surrender anything to him. I don't believe in sin. Jesus did not die for me. Have you ever even read about other religions or other paths to God? How do you know your is the right one for everyone? God made everyone so unique that each has their own path home. Good luck on yours. Allow people to believe and live as they choose just as you would like for yourself. Spread love and light up the world.. Love & Light. Sharon. One Planet = One People

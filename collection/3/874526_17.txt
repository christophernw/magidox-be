It's customary to give give 2 weeks notice, and you might be glad you did the right thing when you have to use them as a reference in the future.  Not for your new job, but the one after that--most employers want to talk to you last 2-3 employers.  So, do the write thing, submit a written brief notice like "Thank you for the opportunity to work at _______________.  I have enjoyed what I have learned here, but now feel my best growth opportunities lie elsewhere.  I am submitting my resignation effective________________.". . This will go in your HR file, so make it brief, professional and positive because it's all that will speak for you long after you leave the job.. . When you new boss finds out where you will be working, my guess is they will tell you to hit the road immediately.  But at least you did the right thing and you protect your professional reputation.  It's always tempting in the moment to burn that bridge, but try and keep your wits about you and not let it get to you.. . Good luck and congrats on the new job!

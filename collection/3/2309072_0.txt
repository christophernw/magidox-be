well actually the words are similar but they really describe different things entirely.  immunopathology can be a word describing the pathology - process of the immune system.. - this typically entails the disease process or the functioning of the system.  Autoimmunity really describes a process where the immune system is triggered and begins to attack the body or cells in the body that it wouldn't normally attack.  Scientists don't know whay this occurs, but Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disease, and so is Lupus and there are others..  so one is about studing this disease process and the other is about the actual disease.. Hope this helps.

Buttermilk is the rich-bodied and thick liquid that remains after butter is churned. Some buttermilks have butter granules added for flavor and eye appeal. Buttermilk contains all the food nutrients essential for health and well-being, and is low in calories. Generally, 8 ounces of buttermilk equals 90-112 calories.

well its most likely the freedom, i have all three gta games, and i have to tell you, it took me a year to fiish all of the missions in gta 3,vice city is great..., but san andreas, it just kills it, too much gangster talk, but.....i think more people are playing that scarface game, its just like gta, yea....most likely the freedom to kill innocent people without concequence.

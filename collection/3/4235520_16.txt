It means 'knowledge', as opposed to 'agnostic' which means 'without knowledge'. It usually refers to followers of Gnostic Christianity, with was the dominant form of Christianity practiced in the first three centuries CE.. . The specific knowledge they are talking about is the secret knowledge given by Christ to some of his disciples, including James, Judas, and Mariam. It is by this knowledge that man is able to transcend the confusion that we perceive as reality. The reason that reality is so messed up is that it was created not by the true God but by a demiurge or half-god called Yaldabaoth (aka Yahweh), who believed himself to be God and created man to worship him. The half-god's mother, Sophia, has made repeated attempts to undo her offspring's mistake by sending messengers to set us free. These came first in the form of a serpent, who told Eve about the Fruit of Knowledge, and then as the Logos (Christ) who preached about how to 'enter the Kingdom' until Yahweh had him crucified.. . 'Orthodox' Christians not only disagree with these ideas, but go totally apesh*t whenever they are mentioned.. . The best way to get a grasp of what Gnosticism is about is to watch 'The Matrix' or any other movie inspired by Phillip K. Dick, a self-described Gnostic. They all contain the theme that this is not the true reality, merely a shadow of reality. It is only by understanding the secret knowledge that you will be set free.

ok well since your car is a front wheel drive car... then your braking is mainly in your fronts not your back brakes. Because the majority of your cars wieght is in the front....i highly doubt its your back....but it is possible.  Depending on how long you have been driving on them....When your pedal starts to vibrate and start hearing a grinding noise with moderate to heavy braking....then it is time to do it then or ASAP. If you drive on them too long you WILL need to replace your rotors....which will be about $40 to $60 a piece.  And the same for your drums too.  Drums are your rear brakes.

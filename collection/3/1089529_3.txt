two good reasons for online classes is its easier to understand everything, especially if you have issues with lectures and being in rooms full of people. And if the class has a discussion board, everyone is more open to talking rather than being reserved and quiet in classrooms. I don't know any con's to it b/c I take as many online classes as I can find.

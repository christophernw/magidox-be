Well they both have a clue. One thinks there is no god. The other knows it. The agnostics may be turned off to Christianity because of logic, or the desire to be able to look in the mirror. They can do that if they realized they evolved. They can't do that if they know what creationism means. Creationism is the thought that we come from Adam and eve. This would mean that we are all related. This would mean we are all inbred. That kind of inbreeding will kill a species. Yet some feel god kept us alive to have sex with our relatives (nice guy). Insulting apes is OK. We did not evolve from them. Apes and humans come from a common ancestor. Now coming from monkeys does not sound too bad. So it may not be a good idea to insult evolution. You may be able to figure out why I am telling you this. Think hard. Use your memory.

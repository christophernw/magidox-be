Over the past 20years i have visited Greece,Athens 3 times, Santorini,Mykinos,Andros,Tinos, Naxos, PAXOS, Zakinthos 3times,Cephalonia, and will be going to Crete this year.   I have NEVER met a rude Greek yet, they are very honest,on two occasions we left gifts in a shop, a handbag outside where we had lunch in Zante town and when we went back our belongings were being looked after for us, so it just shows how honest,friendly,obliging the Greeks are.

being a super-nation severely comprimises everything America believed in since its founding. if we join our alliances w/ mexico and canada, and erase our borders, then we could lose our entire constitution which means we, as citizens, wont be as protected as we are today. but of course, some people, mostly liberals, socialists, and communists, would love to see the citizens lose and the politicians win. they are blind to the individual needs of the citizen. not everyone can conform to the same thing. one size does not fit all.

im tooooooooooooo slim and trim for my age and thats a health hazard. trust me it doesnt feel better either. but maintaining the right figure does. anyways, to lose weight u need to stop gorging on chocs, 4get the aereatd or carbonatd drinks. stop eating breads and pastas. pastries are also a big no-no.... best wishes!!

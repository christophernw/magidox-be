Forever means that as you deny Christ, Truth (God’s true idea), He will deny you.  This is a state of consciousness which feeds everything unlike good and becomes a “real” hell for the unenlightened mortal, thus making the suffering mortal a reality for the person to endure, to be conscious of evil, sin, and death over and over.  It is only Christ who can solve this problem for man.

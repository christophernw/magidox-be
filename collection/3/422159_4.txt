Apart from all the obvious answers that the war With Sparta(at that time Sparta had the strongest and most effective infantry in Europe and Asia), the plague and many other reasons it is often said by many historians that during the Peloponnese's war democracy was Athens' greatest disadvantage. Although this may sound weird since democracy is considered to be one of the greatest achievements of the Ancient World a brief look in the history of the Peloponesian War and 20 years ago will show that this is true. Because of the democratic system many worthy and important Athenians were either banished from the city or executed. There are many examples like Kimon or Aristeidis but the most obvious example is the execution of all naval officers after an important victory against Spartan and Corinthian navy in  Arginusae, because due to bad weather they were unable to collect the dead bodies of the Athenian soldiers. This was a huge blow to the Athenian navy which despite being victorious their morale was destroyed. In addition to this one must not forget that the Athenian people were dragged to war in the Sicilian expedition because they were manipulated by ambitious politicians and generals, who tried and succeded to take advantage of the public opinion in order to achieve their personal goals. This is another example of democracy not working properly in Athens and as everybody knows the Sicilian expedition was a huge military disaster.

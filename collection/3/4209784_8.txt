Even if "The Da Vinci Code" calls itself fiction, it is still blaspheme against God. And I hope for the sake of Dan Brown's soul and the souls of all those who get mislead by this that he repents publicly and tells the truth.. . We should always avoid the occasion of sin, that which could lead us away from God is an occasion of sin. Just like if someone watches porn.. . We as Christians have a right to protest anything that promotes bigotry against us. . . Brown not only blasphemes against the only one who can save us from hell, but he also slanders the Catholic Church and Catholic organizations. Being 2,000 years old, the Catholic Church has its share of scandalous people, but why should someone feel like they have to lie in order to attack the Church?. . By the way, I don't see why a lot of Protestants are tolerating blaspheme against God just because they like the way it attacks the Catholic Church. It doesn't make any sense.. . The saddest thing is that this book and movie are such a big moneymaker in large part to many who call themselves "Christian" but who support this kind of trash.. . The American media publicly apologized for the Muhammad cartoon, so why are we so tolerant when the bigotry is against Christianity?. . As for the answer below this one. No, we Catholics aren't going to bomb anyone. If we were going to we would have done it a long time ago. We know that vengeance belongs to the Lord. But we still have every right to peacefully protest. I don't know why people are objecting to peaceful protest and calling us "fanatics" for being peaceful.. . I doubt that Dan Brown would have even considered writing this book if he thought that there was any chance that his life would be in danger. But I believe that he wrote it because he knows that Christians are generally peaceful and the most reaction he would get would be a peaceful protest. That's why I think he probably thought he could get away with writing this. But I don't envy him come Judgment Day.

Run-away greenhouse effect.  Venus's atmosphere is much denser than ours, and it's almost entirely carbon dioxide (about 95%).  Carbon dioxide is a good greenhouse gas - it traps the heat in, so the surface gets hotter and hotter.. . We have the greenhouse effect here on Earth, too.  Here it's carbon dioxide and water vapor that are the main greenhouse gases - you've probably noticed that cloudy nights are generally warmer than clear nights.  That's because the clouds help keep the heat in, but when it's clear the heat can more easily escape out into space.

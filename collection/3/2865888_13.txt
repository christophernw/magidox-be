Democrats buy votes by giving away benefits at the expense of the minority of people with larger amounts of money and businesses.. . Republicans strive to promote the overall economy buy promoting investing, reducing taxes and government dependence while still helping the  common man who wholds most of the votes.. . I would like the idea of being a Democrat if so many were not just buying votes with plans that do not work.

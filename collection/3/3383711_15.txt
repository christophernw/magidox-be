The problem is that christian ideology has changed over the past 100 years.  All this new age, feel good, crap has taken over. God isn't all loving. He is jealous and vindictive and he punishes people who disobey his commandments..  Read the scripture Job, if it hasn't been taken out of your bible for being too negative. It shows you what kind of sense of humour he has as well.

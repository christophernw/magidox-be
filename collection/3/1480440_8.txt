Not a good idea and very irresponsible -if your dog attacks someone and causeas injury-that persaon has then the right to contact police who can impound your dog--if injuries serious or if it kills someone destroyed-do  you want to put your dog at this kind of risk--I love my dog too much to risk it being impounded.Teaching a dog to attack is also dangerous for once that trait is taught not always under your control-dog can attack then on its own-again putting your dog at risk.Also if you tell a dog to attack and it does You(or your parentsif you're aminor)can be taken to court-fined and depending on severity of injuries your dog caused-jail.  You teaching your dog to attack can also be termed as animal abuse.   I doubt you're going to run into  many prisoners-Doubt you'll run into any  so there really isn't any need or your dog to be trained to attack.  Dogs who are trained to attack are usually trained by Professionals.  This is a veary bad idea.

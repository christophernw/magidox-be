Repentance is admitting you're a sinner.. . Don't repent unless you want to change it because that isn't true repentance you know?. . We are going to screw up.  You know that.  God knows that.. . But knowing He will forgive you when you're way fails and admitting that His way is the only way that keeps you going is Repentance. . . At least that's what I believe.. . Trust in the Lord.  Seek His face and discover just what abundant life is!. . P.S Find some accountiblity and ask for prayers from family and friends.  You're less likely to mess up if you have to confess to others AND the Lord.

Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun can cause skin cancer.  It's best to use sunscreen if you must be in the sun, but avoid the hours from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. when the sun's rays are the strongest.  I can't tell you exactly how it causes cancer, but it's probably due to the genetic changes in the skin from over-exposure resulting in bad sunburns.

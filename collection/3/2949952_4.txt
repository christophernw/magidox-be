Don't limit yourself to one "theme."  You need to read art criticism, take classes, practice, learn about other artists in history...basically study as hard as you can.  Look at all aspects of art.  Never, never limit yourself to anything.  And always remember no matter how good you are at your work, there is always more to learn.

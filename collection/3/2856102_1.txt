To clarify the MFI notation: this means that there is an injector in each cylinder intake port. Pretty much anything sold new these days is multi-port as the engine can be managed much better. However, a few years back there was TBI (throttle body injection) which typically had 2 injectors pumping out enough fuel for 4, 6 or 8 cylinders. While that was better than a carburetor it just isn't good enough for today's low-emission world.

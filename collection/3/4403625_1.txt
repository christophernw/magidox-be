I think they're pretty much the same. They both are based on the rude or inconsiderate person disregarding the feelings of another person. Most rude events are also inconsiderate; talking on a cell phone in a movie theater, cutting someone off in traffic, pushing someone out of the way to get on a bus are all both rude and inconsiderate. I think it's just semantics. If you have an example of something that is rude but not inconsiderate, or inconsiderate but not rude, let me know...

You have quite a few options:. 1. Spray your cat with water when you catch them doing it.. 2. Sticky Paws- www.stickypaws.com. 3. Soft Claws- www.softclaws.com. . DO NOT EVER DECLAW A CAT!!! It is the worst thing you can do to a cat. It causes nerve damage, which results in them NOT using the litterbox because it is too painful for them to bury their stuff. It also results in the cat biting (it is fully aware that it does not have claws anymore, therefore does not swat- just bites). Out of the declawed cats in my shelter, only 1 in every 4 make it up for adoption because most of them are aggressive or do not use their litterbox. CATS WALK ON THEIR TOES, NOT THEIR FEET AS US HUMANS DO. It would be like chopping off our feet, and expecting us to function normally.. . http://www.declawing.com/htmls/declawing.htm

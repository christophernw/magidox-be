Hoover just more or less threw up his hands and let the chips fall where they would.  FDR took a hands on approach, started goverenment programs to help the citizenry earn (WPA), etc., tried to other things to help the nation survive the Great Depression.  His was the New Deal.   Tho I am a Republican, he helped the nation in my opinion.

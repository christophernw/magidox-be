i got the pill Zyban from my doctor, you smoke for 2 weeks while taking it an set  your quit day for sometime within 2 weeks, you continue taking this pill for about 3 months in all. it was the easiest thing i ever had to do, i had tried many times before but couldn't win, quitting is the HARDEST thing anyone has to do, you don't seem to have a problem quitting so i'm sure you can do it again, good luck to you!!!

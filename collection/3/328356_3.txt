because english is the international language and its Americans first language, so they might think they don't need to thinking that they r at the top of the world but actually its a shame for them to know only one language and its a big credit dat other countries know more than one language. The Americans who take the effort of learning Spanish, French or other languages definitely shud be proud just like other country ppl shud be proud as they know more dan one language & the americans who just knows english & dont wana know sum other language shud be ashamed of themselves

You can always stick the chicken in the fridge for a day or two, if you have some time. I know, chicken in the fridge---it might sound like something scary or like a bad case of food poisoning waiting to happen, but as long as you closely monitor the temperature of the fridge and chicken, it should be fine! If you don't have time, just put it in a plastic bag or keep it in the package if it came in one, and run some hot water over it. It won't completely defrost, but the cooking process will take care of the rest!

if the mutation occurred in the current generation then the gamete (sperm or egg), will not carry the mutation,  although sperm is constantly made through life it is made from heterozygous cells from the testes, as these do not carry the mutation of the dna in the lung the gamete dna will not carry the gene for the mutation,   eggs are created very early on in life so would not have a mutation which is a phenotype e.g  observable characteristic so a mutation from the lung from this generation would not be passed on.

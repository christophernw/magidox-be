I think it's a communication thing. They don't want to look at you because they don't want to have any direct contact with you. I personally find it quite rude when people speak to me and have there head down or doing something else (unless of course they have to look away or are engaged in something else)or don't look at me when I speak to them. It depends on the circumstances butwhen there's nothing about, just you and him, they should be lookin at you if you're intacting with each ither in someway.

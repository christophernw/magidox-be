my answer isn't about the catholic church but it's about the christians in general.. . We do know that there are many FALSE gospels.. the patriarches of the early christian era gathered in Libya and chosed the Gospels and they chosed the gospels they took from the disciples themselves or they were sure that these gospels came from them . on the other hand they didn't recognize the books written by others than the gospels but they didn't order to burn them as they've already put an outline to the lawful bible.. Judas gospel isn't the first false gospel found... Barnaba's false gospel was also found before and translated to many languages if you want a copy!! ...

ants go to water and plants you need to find where they are coming from and get rid of them or they will just keep coming back.you can try putting salt around your tank but the best thing would be get a exterminator to come out but that can be expensive. you can go to a farm store or wal mart and get some granules and sprinkle all over you yard and that will help.

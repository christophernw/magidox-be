Lets end some lies... 1. there are no seperate people called the "palestinians" they are only arabs, and are NO different from other arabs in anyway (this includes langauge, culture, history) The first time arabs were called "palestinians" was in 1963 WELL after the re-creation of israel. 2. Israel was being formed BEFORE world war 2 starting back from as far back as 1917 with the balfour declaration - thus it has nothing to do with the holocaust. 3. ARABS (who mystakenly call themsleves palestinians) attack and target civilians and keep on attacking israel. 4. ARABS have 22 arab countries to live in, (and 57 muslim ones). 5. Even when ARABS had complete control over what you want to make yet another arab state, the lands of gaza, west bank and half of jeruslam from the years of 48-67 NO state of palestine was made. 6. This is a religius war. there has NEVER been a single christian suicide bomber in israel. 7. When islam ends the war against israel, then no more muslims or jews will be killed.. 8. There has never in all history been a state, country or nation called palestine. 9. No language, history or culture called palestine. 10. Jerusalem has NEVER been the capital of any arab state, BUT has been a capital of the jewish state many times. 11. There has been MANY and Multiple jewish states on the land called israel throought history.

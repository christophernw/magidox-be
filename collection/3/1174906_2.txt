Scott and Jay gave a pretty good explanation as to the source of the energy being fusion.  However, your question is "why does the sun *go on* shining?". . The answer is GRAVITY.  Gravity keeps the whole mass of the sun from being expelled by the high temperature.  Gravity causes high pressure near the center of the sun which is necessary to sustain the fusion reaction.

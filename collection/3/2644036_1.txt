I have  a 1 year old Chi and they are so hard to train. mine barks at everything that comes close to our yard. so i bought a spray bottle and everytime she barked i sprayed her in the face and said "Enough!" after a few squirts she got it. so now she can bark and all i have to say is enough, if she doesnt listen the first time i show her the bottle and she stops. . Chi's arent stupid, theyre just very stubborn, you just have to be more stubborn than them

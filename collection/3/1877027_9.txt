I dont know why you are getting migrains but I started getting severe migrains last year and my fiancee told me about imagrain/sumatriptan..I know you said you did not want to know about tablets but the ones your using are obviously the wrong ones for you....you do need to see your gp to get these as they will cost you over Â£26 over the counter...DO NOT drink coffee try and stay away from dairy products and sugar..DO drink plenty of water as if trying to dilute the migrain..I hate taking pills as I have hypermobility syndrome so have to take alot of them so I know what you mean when you say not to give you advice on pills ...the only ones that do work are for my migrains .so have left the name for you to ask your gp

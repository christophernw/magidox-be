This might make me sound crazy but oh well.. My parents live in a house that is extremely haunted (t.v. turns on in the middle of the night,the kitchen faucet turns on and off its self,the channels change on the t.v. just to name a few)they moved into this house about 4 years ago and have 2 dogs a chiuauaua(or how ever you spell it) and a Boston terrier both well mannered dogs when any of the things i mention happen the dogs will start barking ,growling,and even howling. The Boston terrier will even shake and hide. So I agree with the others that say they see a ghost. You can not make him quit he feels threaten by the ghost.

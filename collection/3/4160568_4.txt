I am a Canadian white guy with a First Nations great-grandmother which in some circles makes me Metis (pronounced may-TEE).  I do not know what tribe she was from bur speculation is either Cree or Ojibway.. Even when I lived in the States I never heard people claim Cherokee.  I heard Sioux more than anything else.

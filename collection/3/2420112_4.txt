Wow that food looks so good... for me, too spicy is something that i have not yet encountered.. . but then i havent yet tried any of the jabenaro . (pronounved habbennarro)(not to be confused with jalepeno) peppers in the basement.. . I like jalepenos, bannana peppers (pickeled bannana pepperes plain are great) just to name a few.. . im sure that there is something that is too spicy for me, i just havent tasted it yet.

I raised many dogs.  Dogs bark for different reasons.  If you listen closely, they use different barks for different things.  If yours just barks endlessly for no apparent reason then it could be due to insecurity.  A dog has to have a safe place.  Do you keep it in a kennel at night?  Does it have a house if it's an outside dog?  It's better if the house is the right size for the dog.  Dogs also have separation anxiety.  They look to you as the leader of the pack, so to speak.  You must act as it's leader, or it's lost.  Like children, they need someone to look to for discipline, rewards, food, etc..   i could likely provide more specific remedies if I knew your particular situation.  Too many variables to know for sure.  Where you live, dog inside or out, breed of dog, how you handle yourself with the dog, and so on.....

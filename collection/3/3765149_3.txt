I guess that they would say, as clerics, that they are in a position to spiritually educate others and if they became martyrs then who wold do that job? Someone needs to be in charge. It's the same as WW1 generals being behind lines and sending everyone else to their deaths. You need a head to live.. . Many people have died in this world due to the ideals fed to them by others.

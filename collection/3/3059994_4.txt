Because women have these things called. . T!TS.. . It's illicit and socially unacceptable in the public eye for a woman to be topless. It REALLY isn't a problem with me. In addition, I think that this mostly applies in America.. . Go to parts of Africa, and toplessness (if that's a word) is quite common.

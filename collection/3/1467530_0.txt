Just a piece of paper. Some people have prescription pills that street people sell! If all the people who had prescription drugs would just sell it, than they would be just as rich as these drug dealers. I guess the street stuff is a bit stronger though, because they mix like every single drug they can find so that it creates a better high for their client.

According to them, you are supposed to treat your body like a temple.  What's funny is that these same christians who tell you not to smoke will eat unhealthy foods that are high in fat and cholesterol (another common killer among adults).  Think about that the next time a FAT booty christian tells you not to smoke.  HYPOCRISY is the foundation of their religion.

the reason the philippines experience volcanic earthquakes is because the country is included in the  pacific ring of fire.  in a 40,000 km horseshoe shape, it is associated with a nearly continuous series of oceanic trenches, island arcs, and volcanic mountain ranges and/or plate movements.. . as for tectonic earthquakes,  the philippines sits in the middle of the philippine plate.  the left & right of the country are the edges of the plate so when there is movement on the plate, this translates into earthquakes.

The issue is not one of race, but one of law, and allowing others to invade a country illegally and cause harm.  Not saying that the illegals themselves intend to harm, just that they do cause harm by violating the laws and taking it upon themselves to decide how many and who should be admitted to residency in the United States. In my own area I see the harmful effects of a huge illegal immigrant population that does not speak English, does not pay taxes, and yet feels quite entitled to overfill our schools with throngs of especially needy students (educationally, financially and socially)and our public clinics, many of which now serve almost exclusively non-English speaking clients.  No country can be reasonably expected to be able to support this burden on the backs of its own taxpayers without some sort of outcry.  When you add to it, that now jobs are frequently only offered to those with multi-lingual skills (not saying that we should not all speak several languages, but that the requirement should go along with the products of our own education system) and the pay rates and benefits (remember those?) have been dropped to the level of the illegal, this directly harms the citizens regardless of ethnicity.. . The crime in these illegal communities only serves to further drain the public resources away from the good that could be possible if proper and legal immigration were the rule.  . . Immigration laws are the way that a country manages to take in those who can function within the economy and society without causing more harm than good.  Perhaps those laws warrant reevaluation from time to time, but certainly not total disregard.. . Those who start out in a country by immigrating illegally should not just move to the end of the line, but should forever be barred from any possibility of citizenship.  The illegal immigrant has already proven that they have insufficient regard for the laws of the country, no further consideration should be given.

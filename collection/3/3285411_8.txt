The reason you don't get your score is because federal law does not require it for free. Up until 2004 you had to pay for your credit report (unless you were denied credit) until federal law mandated free reports to consumers annually.. . The feds, however, are discussing guidelines for the cost of a credit score. Soon there will be a set amount you have to pay for a score. The feds are discussing amounts between $5 an $7 per score per bureau.

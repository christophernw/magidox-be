BURN THE CANDLE AT BOTH ENDS -- . The "Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins" . The phrase goes back to early 17th century in English and is much older, for it was translated then from the French.. Originally the expression meant to waste material wealth, to use the candle wastefully. Then it took on its more common modern meaning of wasting one's strength, as when someone goes from his day job to one he holds at night, or works for a worthy cause every moment of his spare time, or even does too much partying after work.

practical ok... one day i will die and will be in God's judgement court. God will be seated on the judges place.i will be in a prisoners box. a lawyer named satan will tell the Judge of all bag things i had done and will compell the Judge by saying that "by your own law this prisoner should be handed over to be whipped,beaten to death." God who is the just judge has to pass judgement for my soul to be destroyed in hell. At that very moment another lawyer will appeal his name is Jesus!  Jesus will say "this person knew Me, worshiped Me, believed in Me and had repented for his sin while on earth. he is Mine. I was killed and crucifed without any fault on mine (unblemished lamb was required to be sacrified  as sin offering) I have conqured death by rising again. I give my life in exchange to this persons life so the law is met." now i will be saved of all my punishment and hell because Jesus paid for me in full. I will then enter Heaven.  There is no other than Jesus the saviour. Jesus came to fulfill the law. He had to be without sin (unblemished lamb)

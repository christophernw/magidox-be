Halo 1 hands down. Everything you love in a game --- intense gameplay, epic story, big Hollywood production, and a kick-a** main character. I think I lost a girlfriend, 3 friends, and dropped out of school for a semester when this game came out. Ya...it's that good.. . Microsoft makes the best console out of the big three. Nintendo is too stubborn and Sony is out of touch w/ gamers. I choose Microsoft b/c they listen to gamers and put out what gamers want, not what some stiffs in a boardroom (with most being 2-3 times the average age of a gamer) decides what is best. And with Nintendo still focusing on kiddie games and silly innovations, Microsoft is primed to take over the #1 spot.

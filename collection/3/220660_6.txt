I read somewhere that toothpaste works, but I haven't tried it. My dad has this cd cleaner, I think he bought it for like 5 or 10 bucks. It has this circular sponge thing that you put special cleaner or alcohol on and then you close it and turn the cd using a little latch on the outside. Whatever you do, if you decide to clean the cd yourself without anything special, do NOT go in a circular pattern right around the cd! It'll wipe out your cd for good! Good luck!

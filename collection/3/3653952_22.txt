I am also african american, but I dont see a problem with the confederate flag. Slavery is not the only thing the flag represents. It also represents southern culture and morals. Now and days we are so hypersensitive about stuff, its like saying if was in a car accident no one should drive cars anymore it ridiculus. The only thing that matters here is that we correct are mistakes and no repeat them and to me the confederate flag does that.

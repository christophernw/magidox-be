You must be a sad pathetic person!. I think you should just stay home,what do you suggest mothers do lock their kids up in a house all day with no sunlight or fresh air???????????????. Are you retarted!!!!!!!!!!. Silly question ever,obviously you were a kid once maybe your mummy should have kept you locked in a cupboard for the rest of your life and then we would not be answering your STUPID questions!. We were all kids once for goodness sakes learn some patience and respect,you must have been one of them quiet,boring children with no personality,have you ever had any fun?

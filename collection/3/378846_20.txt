Cats are a natural predator. Alot of people, in country/farming community settings believe that a cat is a farm animal. To be used for their hunting skills to get rid of rodents from the barn and the such. . . The reason why he is bringing a dead rodent to you, is for you to acknowledge his work as a hunter and to share his prized "trophy" to you in hopes for praises and maybe some treats.  This is something to be rewarded as the cat is acknowledging you as his "master".

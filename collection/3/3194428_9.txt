lol.  They are talking about emotional strength and character, such as the pen is mightier than the sword.. . But to open a pickle jar, you have to start from your belly upward.  If you don't have enough strength, use a can opener.. . You could try philosophically talking to the pickle jar, getting all of it's pent up emotions out so you can open it.. . Hey - if you can personify a pickle, so can I.

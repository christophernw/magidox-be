depends on what you believe. . evolution states that originally there were a few species of certain animals, etc. those species evolved and branched apart into two new species.. . just like human evolution; humans and monkeys had a common ancestor. through evolution, the common ancestor broke up into two species, one being human and one being monkey.  (WE DID NOT COME FROM MONKEYS; this is a common misconception amongst the highly religious). . the bible says that 'god' created ALL species at one time in a couple days

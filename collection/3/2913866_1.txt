I believe 1 cc is 1 ml when talking fluid volume.. 15 times 0.033814 will give you US ounces (about half an ounce) 1 us fluid ounce is equal to 2 us tablespoons, so if you don't have a measuring syringue or spoon (cc's, ml, ounces), you can use  a tablespoonfull to approximate. good luck n God bless. Peace.

Simple. Hitler made the twofold dumbass decision to . . 1. doublecross someone he had just signed a treaty with (Stalin) who was just as insane ae he was.. . 2. He chose to do so in the middle of WINTER! He apparently forgot how brutal Russian winters can be. Tanks and men alike were stranded due to frozen fuel lines and dwindling supplies due to the fact that roads were impassable in the frozen tundra.

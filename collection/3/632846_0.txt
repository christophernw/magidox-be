Sometimes the pen can be very powerful ... writings such as Thomas Paine's "Common Sense" helped precipitate the American Revolution.  But I would still say the sword is more powerful.  Conflicts from the American Revolution to the Civil War to the World Wars were all won by superior firepower.  It wasn't our eloquent words that stopped Hitler's reign of terror, it was our men and women in uniform who went to Europe and defeated the Nazis by the superior strength of our military.

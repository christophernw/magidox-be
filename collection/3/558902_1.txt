Because some men are insane. And we can't let those men do whatever they want.. So we have to be able to control them.. so as to protect them and others... Some are stupid.. which is just as bad as insane.. As for drugs, alcohol, and cigars.. people don't usually use them to die.. they use them to temporarily shed depression.. and they often work.. they are a means of meditation.. though an unsafe means.. they are an effective means..

The phrase mergers and acquisitions or M&A refers to the aspect of corporate finance strategy and management dealing with the merging and acquiring of different companies as well as other assets. Usually mergers occur in a friendly setting where executives from the respective companies participate in a due diligence process to ensure a successful combination of all parts.. On other occasions, acquisitions can happen through a hostile takeover by purchasing the majority of outstanding shares of a company in the open market.. . Breifly stated a merger happens when two entities decide to join together - like 2 people agreeing to be married. An aquisition happens when one entity takes another entity - like shotgun weddings or arranged marriages. I hope that helps.. For a more detailed explanation please see web page listed as my source.

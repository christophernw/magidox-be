Ok, well, first you need to get an undergraduate degree in one of the social sciences.  Then, in order to practice, you must go to graduate school.  After graduate school you need to acquire about two years of supervised therapeutic work to get a license to practice independently.. . Then, the question is too broad to answer.  The values and attributes of a therpaist will llikely depend on the therapeutic approach being used (i.e. Gestault, Psychotherapy, Stengths Based Approach, Narrative Therapy, etc etc).  Therapists tend to find thier own niche.. . So really, a good therapist should figure out what you wish to work on, and what approach to use.  If they cannot use that approach they should refer you to someone who can.. . Hope this helps.

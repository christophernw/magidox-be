I know this might be a difficult thing for you to consider but, what if you are wrong?. . Isn't it better to have a contingency plan in the event there is no rapture and the end of times as described in Revelations turns out to be simply a fever dream; given that John was seriously ill while on the Isle of Platmos?  In mean, in a practical sense, and as an example, didn't you apply to more than one university in the event that the favored one did not accept your application?  Didn't you think that was a good idea at the time?. . I think equally, it is a good idea to take care of our home, our beloved earth, just in case the writings of Revelations turns out to be a very dramatic and colorful hallucination.  Don't you?

What your friend did to you is more popularly called an "Airplane" and how it knocks you out is that it doesn't allow oxygen to get to your brain for a little while. Yes, there are side effects...It kills brain cells, which can never be replaced, and if when you pass out, you hit the ground the wrong way...you may die or never wake up. I suggest you don't do that anymore.

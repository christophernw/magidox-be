Actually they're both supposed to be the speed limit . ex: 55mph. . but the left lane is there so you can overcome another car by going up to not over 10 mph over the speed limit (so 65mph then) to only overcome that vehicle then you are "supposed" to return to the right lane remaining at ex: 55mph.

people wear light colours in summer bcoz dark colours absorb more sunrays.its like this-sunrays have a colour spectrum consisting of seven colours which one sees in a rainbow.these colours are violet,indigo,blue,green,yellow,orange,red.but there are two more parts of sunrays that are-ultravoilet rays & infrared rays.infrared rays are heat rays that can't be seen but can be felt.Dark colours absorb more infrared rays i.e heat rays.. white is coolest in summers bcoz it reflects all the colours and I.R rays on the other hand black absorbs all the colours and heat rays too.

Applying direct heat, either with a heating pad or by placing a moistened hand towel in a zip-lock bag and heated in the microwave over the affected area -- as hot as you can stand it (without burning your skin, of course)  Cover the whole side of the face where the tooth is located.  I also take an aspirin or equivalent and lie down in a quiet place.  My pain has ALWAYS been abated within 45 minutes.  HEAT KILLS PAIN!!!. . PS- If using the zip-lock method, I always use two, so one can be warming as the one applied cools down, so that I can keep the heat as constant as possible.  . . Trying it certainly can't make you any more uncomfortable than you already are, and you may be surprised.  Certainly, make an appointment with a dentist, as this will keep recurring until the cause of the pain is determined and eliminated.

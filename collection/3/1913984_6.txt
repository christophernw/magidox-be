Evil ? How is it that these unique forms of communiction of which the Creator has allowed become the tool of evil ?. Only if you allow it to be as such. The Creator states that:..My Thoughts are not as your thoughts neither are My Ways as your ways..." Hhmmm... seems to me, that it's in my thinking that the evil exists not in or on whatever medium of;" thought-processing" is employed by others.Whether it be film; books; theatre or whatev.... It's all on you and your personal relationship with your thinking and Thought.. . Peace. . I guess if it's subliminal then there'd be some type of manipulation ? Or, what ?

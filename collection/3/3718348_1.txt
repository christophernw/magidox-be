Balancing a checkbook is keeping track of how much money you have at any one time in your checking account. Basically you start with the balance of your checkbook(how much you have in the account right now). You add in all deposits that are made to that account and subtract any money taken out of the account(checks, ATM withdrawals, etc.)

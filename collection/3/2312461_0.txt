In all fairness, I have to say that there are both intelligent and not-so-intelligent people on both sides. However, the Christian fundamentalists have hijacked the Republican Party, and fundamentalists tend to be less educated than non-fundamentalists and are often intolerant of ambiguity. This is probably the main reason why Republicans often seem less than intelligent. And unfortunately, Bush exemplifies this.

There is no such thing as bad luck from breaking a mirror. The concept started when silvered glass was very expensive. Back then if you broke a mirror it would cost more than a years wages to get another one. . . However, if you want to believe that you can have bad luck, the wives tales say to dispose of the glass in a pit dug on the night of the full moon, saying three hail maries, and the Lord's prayer as you walk backwards then forwards around the hole three times.

I can't help thinking your friends who tell you his comments are stirring up sh*t. Perhaps tell them that you don't want to hear any more of the student's ignorance repeated to you.. . I don't know whether you'd do any good trying to talk to him. It might embarrass him into shutting up, at least, so maybe it is the right thing to do.. . I'm inclined to think that it will be counter-productive.. . You can't force a closed mind open. It's really up to him.. . The purpose of the class (and therefore, the teacher's main purpose) is to combat this very thing, but apparently the teacher doesn't know of the comments. Perhaps informing the teacher would be good.. . I did give a thumbs up to the person who said you should offer to answer questions about Islam (which, I gather, is your faith). Maybe that would be a good move.. . You may just need to leave things alone and hope (or pray, perhaps) the freak gets a clue some day -- and tell your friends you really don't want to hear about it, you know there are a lot of ignorant people, but it does no good to anyone to keep telling you the specifics.

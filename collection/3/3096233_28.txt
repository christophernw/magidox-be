I had a huge problem gaining weight. When I was 15 years old (10 years ago) i was 5'10 95 Lbs. I did not like to eat and was way too skinny. I attempted to eat everything in sight milkshakes pizza and a lot of bad food. I gained 30Lbs in 2 months but i also blew $1000 in cash doing it. I recently wanted to gain more weight and went to GNC and picked up a weight gainer (if ur picky about the take check out cryosports cryo gain) mix 4 scoops with 16 oz. of whole milk for breakfast and before you go to bed. Add at least 2 good meals to the two shakes and ur guaraneteed to gain weight. I gained 10 pounds a month for 2 months doing that. I also spent a lot of time in the gym so most of it turned to muscle. also while ur trying to gain weight be lazy. Avoid cardio and sports.

It has nothing to do with their beliefs, if a person is basically good or bad, their behaviour will be motivated by their nature. There are many "nice" atheists as there are many horrible believers, not just Christians, but most religions have their good and bad people, just like in life in general. There are also some pretty terrible atheists too.

you have to follow your heart! Don't be so hard on yourself either your always going to have to decide in life so what if you made a mistake in you opinion at least you are trying and know its important to have a career instead of a job!! We learn from our mistakes just try and relax or for a run or work out this helps me when I'm stressed out, go rent a great movie a funny one. You will be OK

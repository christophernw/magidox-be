unfortunately he does NOT have anything to do with the price of gas..I said unfortunately ..because if he did from all the political pressure he would have to lower the price of gas..but he does not have anything to do with it... all he can do is lower eh taxes that the government receives from the sale of gas..that would lower or tax reserves..and stop programs...and we all know what programs this would be...for the poor... it is the large oil companies who do nto care if we lose everything as long as they get their BILLIONS of dollars every few months... you all have heard which gas stations to stop buying from..but each and every day..you still see people buying gas from them..WHY..because no one really cares...they say let the other guy do it..pass the buck theory..which does not work ... we need ot all send letters to all the political people in our states and Washington DC..let them all start putting pressure on the large oil companies. gas needs to be sold at no higher then $1.10..it is being sold for under .50 cents in the Arab nations...? ? ?. smile. and Good Luck

Ask your dad to rent the system for you, just for a couple days. Spend time playing games with him, rent something he might really enjoy. After it is returned, he will want to play those games again, and who knows, may buy you that game system.. . If that does not work, you could tell him, that you might be forced to sell drugs or get a real job to buy it yourself.

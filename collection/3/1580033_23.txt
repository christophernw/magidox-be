you do not believe in God and you do not need mercy or forgiveness. Well good for you. You don't have the worries many of us do about what comes after this life.  you don't believe so what is it that you want.  What does it matter what Christians think they have You know the truth be happy with that.. . Truth is truth  believe it or don't. In the end what you or me or anyone else believes doesn't matter because what is, is and what will be, will be, but I have a question for you?. Do you ever think about what will happen if you are wrong?. . About Christians not being accepting,  one that is a sin they will have to atone for because that is not what Christianity is supposed to be about but if you expect a Christian to accept your belief that there is no God, why don't you go and get a cat ot accept the fact that maybe it is a dog and the blame it for still being a cat.  you dont accept, why should they.

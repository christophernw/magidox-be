The same thing that happened during the Vietnam War.. . It is the job of any true patriot to CRITICIZE the government of this country and keep it in check. It is our jobs that we have taken on by being voters. If we all just follow our government around like sheep we aren't living the true meaning of DEMOCRACY which is that everyone - EVERYONE is a part of this process - from the ditch-digger to the CEO. When I criticize Bush it is because I LOVE this country and want us to be a world leader again. Thanks to our current administration, we are hated and feared throughout the world. It didn't always use to be this way.. . FP

One of the simple rule of thumb is 2 x total yearly turnover. This means if your yearly turnover is US$1million, it may be possible to sell at US$2million. However, there are other additional parameters like profitability, loans & liability, growth prospects, customer base, brand value, etc. If you are really serious, involve a company to do a vaulation for you, for example KPMG.

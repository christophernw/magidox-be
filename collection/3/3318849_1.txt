The absolute value makes the function nonintegrable over the vertex of the graph.  This occurs when the normal function would turn negative but the absolute value makes it positive.  You have to perform 2 integrals.  One goes from -4 to -3/2.  The next goes from -3/2 to 2.  You have to flip the sign of your function when you do the integral over the region that would normally be negative

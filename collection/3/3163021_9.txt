The communists always celebrate May 1st as "May Day", a day for labor to march, protest or celebrate as the case may be.. It's not scary,  it's just the way they have been doing it for the past 70 years or so.  In America, we use Labor day to celebrate labor, and use Mayday to clebrate spring.  I hope everyone apreciates all the hard work done by the workers of the world for all of us.  They (we) deserve respect, decent wages and healthcare, it is labor that gets the work done, in the office, factories and farms all across America.   Some Communists groups march with labor unions,  I don't like their political views at all, but they have the right to express themselves in America.

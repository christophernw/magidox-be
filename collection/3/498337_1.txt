Don't forget plenty of water!  Until the feed store opens, you can give your duckling all sorts of goodies.  The first poster was right, grain based products are good but don't forget to add green as well!  Leafy bits of celery and lettuce, even grass from your yard!  As it gets older, you can even give it bugs!  Have fun with your new baby!!

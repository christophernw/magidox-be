The switch that is attached to the Emergency Brake Pedal is probably stuck or the wire has grounded out somewhere. Or your cables have frozen and the emergency brake is still activated. Make sure your cables aren't frozen. Try to pull the pedal all the way up first. Then get under the dash and look for a wire attached to a small switch on the E-Brake pedal assembly. Check and make sure the switch is open. Check the wire going to it for any signs of the insulation being rubbed off and the wire being grounded. If it's not that then as a few people have stated, check your brake fluid level in the master cylinder.

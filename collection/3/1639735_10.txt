You're a little confused. Moses was ordered to slaughter sheep (or maybe goats??) and mark the homes of the Hebrew families with blood (yuck) so that the angel of the lord would skip their houses when they went through and slaughtered all the first born sons.. But I agree with you. He's a little too twisted a diety for my tastes.

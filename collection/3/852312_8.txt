I accept there may be more need for spending in Scotland and I have no gripe with that. In a United Kingdom there will always be areas requiring a redistribution of wealth. What gets on my nerves is when some Scots start complaining about North Sea Oil revenues etc. I've always said if they want independence then they should make up their mind and start working for it.

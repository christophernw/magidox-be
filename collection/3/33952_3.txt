I felt the same at age 17.  At 24 I married my wife knowing that we couldn't conceive our own kids. In 1982 we began to search for a baby to adopt and found that we needed to include "special needs" kids because there are so many available to adopt. Our kids are now 22,20,18,16 and by some miracle I became a family-man.

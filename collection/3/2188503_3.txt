It's generic in the sense that you will take courses in a number of different subdisciplines.  You will take classes in neuropsychology, developmental, industrial/organizational, or other areas of psychology.  To some extent, you may be able to focus on one area more than others when you are taking upper-level electives, but you still will cover several areas in survey courses.  In contrast, graduate-level study in psychology is highly specialized, where you apply to a program for one specific area.  For example, I could talk your ear off about social psychology, but I'd be clueless if I had to explain a technical neuroscience article.  I could maybe talk about basic brain structures and functions, but that's not what I study in depth.

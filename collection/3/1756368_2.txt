Trucking can never and will never be replaced. You need to show a little respect for someone that provides you with every single aspect of your life. Everything you have is brought to you by a trucker. Your clothes to the store. The cars to the dealership. EVERYTHING. So, instead of imagining a world without us, how about thanking a trucker someday for providing you with everything you own.. . Alright. its cool. Didn't mean to come down on ya hard at all. There are just a lot of people out there now a days that are doing everything in their power to get every truck off the road. And when someone wants to mess with my job and my life like that, I get a little defensive. If ya have any questions, feel free to ask.

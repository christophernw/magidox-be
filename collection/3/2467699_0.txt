It was probably a form of "archiving" where the artist writes the materials he/she used on the back of the artwork in case a museum or owner one day wants to have the work cleaned or treated.  Aquarelles are some sort of water soluble medium - watercolors, water soluble pencil and the series is just a number given to the production number assigned to that particular "recipe" for the product.

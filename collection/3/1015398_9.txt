I think most people will say to experience life with everything in it like fruits, religion,travelling etc., but i think that is not completely right. The answer to your question is to live, life is beautiful, to live your life the way you are living it cause your pathway is cut you walk in mere footsteps that's already been made by you, but not only to live to die as well. Death in it's own is beautiful as well, it is to be content, you get released from life and all its beauty and ugliness. To be a part of everything but yet be nothing.To be and not to be.. . The answer is to live and to die.

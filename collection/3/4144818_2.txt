There was a sketch on Saturday Night Live a while back that addressed your question directly. It was a commercial for a new and wonderful book that helped anyone with financial problems to work them out.  The host held the book up. It was one page.  Basically, it said, Don't spend more than you make.. . What?  said Steve Martin.  I should only spend what I can afford??. . You've got it said the host!. . Unbelievable, said Steve and the woman playing his wife. They couldn't believe that their problems had been solved!. . And, neither should you.  Spend, spend, spend!  Yes.. it's the American way.. Keep up with the Joneses and the Smiths and the folks next door.  Why stop now?  . . Or.. write down your monthly income on the left side of a legal pad and on the right, list your monthly bills.  List them all, including taxes and incidentals like a couple of bucks a day for Starbuck's.  List the newspaper and the cable and your utilities.. . Then, add that list up.  If it exceeds your income. STOP... . Go to the list on the right and put a line through one non-essential and subtract that from the monthy gross spending.  Are you balanced yet?  Repeat.. . Or... . Find a second job.  Send your wife and children out to collect recycling stuff like soda cans and glass and newspapers.  . . ///. . Seriously.  From the tone of your question, you know the answer already don't ya?. . Of course, you do. We all do, but we are consumers and we rationalize our spending and credit makes it all so easy, doesn't it?  . . The only way to balance is to balance.  If paying a hundred bucks a month interest on your Visa card is a way of life, then, go for it. Let your kids inherit your debt and live like a king in the meantime?. . Naw.. that's no good.. Just do the things you already know... . whew.

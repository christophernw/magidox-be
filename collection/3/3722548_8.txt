To me meditation is a place that transcends you to another level of being. I do not meditate in what others would deem as meditation, because it happens naturally for me when I am practicing my professin(massage) When I am doing energy work like that I know that my body is a vessel, and that in order to open myself up to something that powerful, I have to let go of earthly limitations. To me meditation is to touch the source of your being, and stop the earthly voices and listen to the higher being that lives in all of us, and to somehow manifest that into our every day life. So I would say there is no technique it's just being , and the result of that is everything.. I wish you well

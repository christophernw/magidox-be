Because they save the government a great deal of money. A trial cost tax payers money and when a defendant pleads guilty the taxpayers save money. Many times a person will be arrested for a crime they didn't commit. The crime they get arrested for is usually one grade above the actual crime they commited. Then they plea bargain down to the actual crime they commited. This gives the District Attorney leverage and or he can downgrade the crime at his discretion (change the charges). He would downgrade the charges if there is little chance of a conviction of the higher crime. The reason to plead guilty and receive a lower sentence because the defendant admits guilt and knows his crime is wrong is falacious. It just puts a pretty face on the way our governmant operates sometimes.

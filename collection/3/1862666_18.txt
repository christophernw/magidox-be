Remember adam and eve and how they were lured? ok movies such as Da Vinci Code etc are not evil (they may or may not be..but that is another discussion) but these movies hold the same lure. Anything prohibted, controversial with religion attracts people, because they hold a fascination. The fascination may simply be due to lack of knowledge, the fact that other people are talking about it  - we're talking abt it and if someone who didnt know about such films saw our discussion; even he would grow curious about it since there is so much talk about it. And the last reason is rebellion. plus in today's hi-tech world,watching a 2 hour movie with glam and action is so much better than reading the old fashioned book for people.

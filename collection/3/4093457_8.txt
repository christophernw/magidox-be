My boyfriend gets them all the time as his skin is very sensitive. try and not use soap as it irritates the skin, use sensitive foam gel. And i know that this sounds nasty but try to pluck the hair so new hair can grow freshly or use hair removing cream it sounds silly but it really works...please please don't pick as it might scar.... Good luck

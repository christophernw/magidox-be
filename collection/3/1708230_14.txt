In most cases suicide is a sin because it is total dispair in God's ability to help you through what you are dealing with. However, since only God can judge the heart, no one knows if any particular person's suicide was a sin. Many suicides are the result of mental disorders in which the person has no real control over what they are doing. In this case, the person is not so much a suicide victim as a victim of the disease they were fighting. Again, these are general statements, no one can judge a particular instance other than God himself.

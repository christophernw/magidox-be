You could try using a meat tenderizer that you buy (it is kind of like a seasoning you sprinkle on the meat).  Or you can tenderize it the old fashioned way of beating it with a tenderizer/any sharp object.  Also, cook it low and slow.  Have you ever tried grilling?  I think a grilled steak is always the best.

I believe it happens when electrons jump from one atom to the next without sharing the electron.  For every proton in an atom this is an electron, however there can be more or less electrons per proton, and that is how things become positivly or negativly charged. If an atom has less electrons than protons the atom is positvely charged, and if it has more it is negatively charged since electrons are negative and protons are positive.. . It's when atoms or compounds of opposing electrical charges touch the electron jump, and an electrical spark is created. Materials can be forced to collect or looses too many electons causing matericals with positive and negative charges to exists though energy exerted on the object like from friction.

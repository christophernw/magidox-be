SHOW me these so-called 'experts' who have disproven the recidivism rate.  Show me them.  . . Most people who work with sex offenders will tell you that their crimes often start small, but will inevitably - YES INEVITABLY - lead to larger, more horrific offences.. . What would you describe as a 'minor' or 'moderate' sex offence?  Flashing at little girls?  Touching someone inappropriately?  Even THESE behaviours should be at least publicised.  I completely disagree with you.. . I, for one, rest easier at night knowing that there isnt' a sex offender in my neighbourhood - for my sake, and the sake of my daughter.

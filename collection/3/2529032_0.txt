It will run you thousands. I couldn't tell you the exact cost because my insurance paid for it.  But, I know that is what the doctors/hospitals charge.  I worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield for over 25 years. . . You might want to consider getting government assistance if the surgery is medically necessary.  Good Luck.

Can you provide more details - do they come to your class for a particular subject to sit in and listen?  Maybe figure out a way to have them interact - whatever the subject matter is, they may have real life examples where the subject applies and they resolved something.  Make it real for the kids.  Also, maybe you can get their opinion on how they'd like to get more involved, they'll probably have 1 or 2 good ideas.

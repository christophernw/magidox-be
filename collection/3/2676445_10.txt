When you live literally HUNDREDS of years you tend to have a lot of children.  It might sound gross, but the way it is now isnt the way it was back then, we cant talk about then and think about now.  They needed to populate the earth, and they did.  I highly doubt the sons produced children by their mother, or the daughters with their father.

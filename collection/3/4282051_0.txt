It's probably not a right and employers are often afraid of getting sued for their answers. However, if you really want to know contact the Human Resources Department and tell them that you would really like to work for their company in the future and you were wondering what steps you could take to improve your chances. No matter what you hear be sure to thank them for their time. You'll probably learn from the experience and if they are a good employer they will be impressed with your desire to improve.

yeah ask at the store to make sure, but its not hard, most likely your tap is either a lever or wing type. the wing type(it has two 3-4" handles or wings at the bottom to grab) you just line up the teeth on the keg to the spaces on the the tap and push down and turn till it locks in place(about 1/2 turn). the lever type(it has one handle on one side)  line up the teeth and then you place in the the opening, and then push the lever down until its locked in place. the beer will pour if you did it right. good luck

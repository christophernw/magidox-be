Ask everyone that you know if they know any nice family that would love to have the dog.Or post signs in a nice neighborhood.When they call,,tell them that you are interviewing all callers & will let them know within a few days.Ask questions like,,do you have the means to afford the animal,,do you have a yard,,are there other playmates or children,,will the dog have company in the day or be alone all day,,what will you feed the dog,,will you keep this pet to old age ,,this way you can get the picture of what kind of home it will have.When I was placing pups to new homes,,I also told them that if it doesnt work out,,to return the pet so you can be sure that it never ends up in a shelter unwanted.That worked for me once,,the pup started growling at the husband & he told the wife to call the pound before he returned home that day,,she remembered what I had said & called me.He was a sweet dog ,,just scared of the new surroundings.Dalmations are beautiful dogs & quite popular,,I dont think that you will have that much trouble finding a good home.Some people like older dogs too because they dont have to be trained or chew alot.Sometimes older people will adopt an older dog.Good Luck & thx for caring for this animal.

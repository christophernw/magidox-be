While we think of diabetes as a sugar problem, given enough time and poor control of the sugar, the arteries in the eye (and in the kidney) start to fail.  They do so by dilating, leading fluid and later blood, growing new abnormal vessels (neovascularization) and causing scarring within the retina and on the surface of the retina which will cause a retinal detachment and blindness (proliferative retinopathy).   If you are a longer term diabetic - more than 5 years - or having visual changes, than you need to see an ophthalmologist as soon as possible.  Do not see an optometrist as they are not medically trained.  An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who can treat your condition if present.   He will examine your retina, sometimes take photos including those using a dye (fluorescein) to outline the vessels and plan treatment with laser for abnormal areas to prevent further damage.  He will also check the eyes internal pressure to see if that is abnormal.  A regular eye examination for diabetics is essential and can save the vision.  You cannot do it yourself although you can control your diabetes as well as possible (and to be sure that is a difficult and daily job).

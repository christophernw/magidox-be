Feline AIDS, or more precisely, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) is a virus that attacks the immune system of cats only.  It is similar to AIDS in humans, but not really the same thing. There is no cure, and cats that have it are more prone to diseases and infections, so you should work closely with your vet to monitor your cat's health, and treat the various illnesses it may be more susceptible to because of the FIV.  Cats can still live long, relatively healthy lives with FIV, so it is not hopeless!

People respond much better when asked to do something specific rather than generally "get more involved", so identify some tasks for parents to do (e.g. give a lecture on their field of expertise, help out with an art project).  And although this is time-consuming, consider asking people individually; many who are reluctant to volunteer in response to a general call will say yes if approached one-on-one.

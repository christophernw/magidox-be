Your accusation is just blatantly untrue.  The West has more instance of mental disorder _recorded_ because we have a robust enough mental health system to detect it.  Someone in a 3rd world country could be mentally challenged as well, but if there is insuffient medical technology, it would go simply undetected, and not recorded.  Just because it is not recorded does not mean it does not exist.  Your second accusation is flagrantly false.  The suicide rate in the developed world is markedly low, but again suicides in less developed places do occur, they just lack a sufficiently advanced system of coroner's offices and public records to record them.  We are 'developed'.  If you have any doubt about this, perhaps it would do you some good to spend a year in Somalia or Nigeria, then come back and try to claim that we have misunderstood 'developed'.  And even if we did have a higher instance of suicide, it would be more than offset by the multitudes of people who die in less-developed nations do to such things as poverty, starvation and exposure.  It's striking at how we in the West, comfortable at our computers in our armchairs sipping brandy and watching the morning news, can so easily take for granted the material comforts and incredible riches of the Western world.. . ** IN ADDITION **. . How dare you (asker) challenge those of us intellegent enough to bring statistics to the discussion.  You're the one claiming that the West has 'higher' rates of this-and-that, which is - after all - a type of statistics.  Perhaps you just losen your grip on that tree, put down the Bible and pickup a copy of USA TODAY -- things aren't all sunshine and fuzz in the 'un'developed world.

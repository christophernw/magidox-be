I would recommend against making any formal "break-up" with that person. Just agree in between yourself and your best friend that you will trust each other and try to avoide having her around. However subtle you put your "official parting" announcement, she will get hurt, and may even try to pay back to you two. Just send mute signals that both of you don't have time for her by giving her reasons other than herself. She will cry over for lack of attention from you two, but given such person's personality who has to have attention, she'll go seek another victim, hopefully soon.. . I used to have a similar friend, and I didn't make any scene out of what she was doing to me and my friends, but it just naturally happened over time as we went to college. Since then, I ran into her once, and I dreaded her coming back into my life, but it didn't happen.. . Doing it the long way is a lot tiring, but I think it helps in long run and eliminate any risks of getting bad reputation yourself.

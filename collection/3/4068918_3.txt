Hey,. This is my connotation of violence-. .      Violence is a bi-product of that human stage when one becomes a complete slave to one's ego, (also called as highest stage of one's ego inflation) and the person is totally disconnected from rationalization, and reasoning ,feelings of rage and anger are created and the person resorts to means such physical offense{which is generally termed as, 'violence'}, though the actual violence starts mentally and emotionally.. .       Violence generally needs a strong stimulus by which a human being first gets emotionally overwhelmed, then surrenders to self ego, loses reasoning and rationalization,becomes full of rage and anger, and then resorts to physical violence.. . . . Hope u don't become violent.......................

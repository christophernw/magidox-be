Russian is my native language, so i can tell you exactly what that means. it goes for "is Salta available?". most likely Salta is for short for Saltanatat (though its' the first time i've ever heard that name) and the person answering the phone asks someone esle in the residence.. if you need any more help with russian language e-mail me

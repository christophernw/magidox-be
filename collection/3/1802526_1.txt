As far as I know, pretty much everybody else in the world except the U.S. converted to metric decades ago.  I can remember reading an article when I was a kid that said that the U.S. would be switching over by 1973.  I guess we are a little behind schedule.  There is something to be said for uniformity, and metric is not so difficult to learn, so the question is why we never changed over.  Because we are stubborn and don't give a damn about the rest of the world.  About the only times you will see the metric system used here is in science (because scientists are rational and recognize themselves to be part of an international community) and manufacturers who have realized that they can charge the same for a slightly smaller package in metric units than for a similar package in standard units(750 ml. instead of a fifth for liquor, 1.75 l rather than a half gallon for ice cream, etc.)

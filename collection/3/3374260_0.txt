Not very many countries in the Far East drive on the left. Aside from most former British colonies, there's Japan, Indonesia, Macau, Mozambique, Thailand and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Also, you don't have to have the steering wheel on the right in order to drive on the left... but many countries have banned cars with steering wheels on the wrong side.

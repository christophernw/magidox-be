I've never heard of black being a word reserved for black people any more than white is (I'm black). It's a color, not a slur. . . Also, black people living in China has nothing to do with your question. Seeing as though you posted that as an answer in another question that had nothing to do with that topic, I think you are a little fixated.. . To answer your real question, black people travel just like white people travel.

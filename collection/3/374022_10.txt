It's not the moon itself which covers the sun, but the moon's shadow.  That shadow can affect the type of eclipse visible from earth.  Depending on what part of the sun the shadow affects, you could be standing in the middle of that shadow and see a "total" eclipse or off to the side for a "partial" eclipse.

He might be sick or injured. I'd personally take him to the vet to make sure he's okay. . . My male cat is so over-sensitive that when something changes in his world or upsets him, he throws a hissy fit. Literally. He hisses at whomever for no reason and then gives this God-awful half meow,half growl.

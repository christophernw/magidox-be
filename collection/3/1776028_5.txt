Assuming your pads were changed and not prematurely worn out, the most likely culprit is inproper installation of the brake pads.. that squeal is actually a high pitched viberation caused by movement of the brake pad in the caliper.. a good mechanic can fix this by adjusting the pad fit to caliper or applying one of several products to correct the fit.. its annoying but nothing real serious...

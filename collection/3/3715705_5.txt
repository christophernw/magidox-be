There are many exercises that will tighten the muscles around the breast. But, since the breast is made up mostly of fat then this will take a really long time.. Don't buy into all these pills and creams, they don't work. Exercise is the most effective if you are willing to put in the time.. Or if you just want your breasts lifted in order to look good in clothes, I suggest investing in some good bras. You can also find bikinis with this support.. Good luck! Be patient.

I have never thought that most atheists are genious' actually I think most of them are foolish for not beleiving in God.  I would beleive in almost any religion before becoming an Atheist.  Don't they think that they got here somehow?  It can't all be science there is something greater out there.  Maybe people are atheists because they don't want to deal with the consequences of sining so they choose to just not beleive in any of it.

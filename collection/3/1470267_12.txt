The sun is yellow because of its photoshere.  The temp on the surface of the sun is approx 5000 degrees F, the interior of the sun is millions of degrees.. Since the surface is so cool it emits radiation in the visible light of yellow/orange which our eyes can interpret.  If we look at the surface temp of a white dwarf, it is in the millions, that is why it is white.  Just like on a flame, the blue flame is hotter than yellow, which is hotter than orange.. . The sky is blue because the freq of the blue light reflected off particles in the air, spreading the blue light, which is able to make it to our eyes.  The reason why the sky is red at dusk and dawn is because the red freq are the only ones able to avoid hitting particles on its way to our eyes, the blue light cannot make it because it has to travel a greater distance when the sun is low.  Because the oscillations of red light are spread way out, as the blue light oscillates very fast running into to many particles to reach our eyes.

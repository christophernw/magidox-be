Kick the bucket, a venerable slang term meaning 'to die', is so vivid an expression that we tend to think there must be an underlying story. In fact, there has been a certain amount of speculation. . . One theory holds that the origins of the phrase lie in the science of animal husbandry. Slaughtered hogs, with their throats slit, were traditionally hung by their heels on a high wooden block. Since they were hoisted to the block by a rope on a pulley--rather like the way one pulls up a bucket from a well--the high block, or beam, came to be known as a bucket. Supposedly, the hogs' dying struggles as they kicked against this so-called bucket led to the birth of the idiom. Not a pretty picture! And not all scholars agree that this is the origin of the term.

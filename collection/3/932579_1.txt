Try reverse sit-ups, where your feet are off the ground at 90 degrees to your body.  Then lift your shoulders off the floor and curl in your rib cage.. . Method (copied from "essential abs" by Kurt Brungardt):. Lie on your back with your head and neck relaxed and your hands behind your ears.  You want your lower body to form two right angles.  Your thighs should be perpendicular to your upper body, with your lower legs parallel to the floor.. Use your lower abs to raise your hips off the floor and toward your rib cage.. Then, in a controlled motion, slowly lower your hips back to the starting position.  As the lightly touch the floor, repeat.. . . I found that this method requires only a minimal amount of movement to tense the abs and so places much less strain on your neck.  I've read several times that a little neck strain is normal and that gentle stretching helps.  As for the technique though, your hands should actually be placed just behind the ears, rather than behind the head, so that you pull with your abs and not your neck.  Plus if you want to keep your neck in position then place a rolled up towel underneath it.

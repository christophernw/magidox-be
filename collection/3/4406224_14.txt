I don't think the order really matters, I just think its important to pick a certain amount of time each day to set aside for reading and stick to it.   As to what books/chapters to read, their are several ways to approach it.  I know some people just start from Genesis and read a little bit each day until they get all the way through to Revelation.  That may seem  overwhelming though.  Somebody once suggested starting in the Greek Scriptures (Matt thru Rev).  Though all of the Bible is important, the Greek scriptures only have 27 books, so somebody who plans to make it a goal to read the whole Bible might want to first make it a goal to read these books.  You might also appreciate the counsel in these books about how to walk in the footsteps of Christ.  I also like to pick books that are of particular interest to me.  The Psalms are great if you are feeling down.

first forget compassion and embrace money, lots of it, then get in with a big corperation like the oil industry, they will pay for whatever you need, as long as they will continue to control your every move and decission.. . . Or begin with a seat in a board of dirctors in a small town or get elected in a city as a council member then work real hard be honest to your self and do what no other politician has done , get to the top without taking the bribes and avoid all the sharks in the sea of corruption called out government and the corporate giants.

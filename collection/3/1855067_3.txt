Where have you just moved to? If you have moved to a small village, then you will have to take a trip into the nearest big town or city.. The best thing to do is do a Google search for gay clubs in your area.. You can also buy a book called The Spartacus Guide, which lists every single gay venue in the world (or just take a look at it in the shop!).

There is no short answer to your question because there are so many variables involved.  There are many types of bonds. The safes are Treasury Bonds issued by the US government. Perhaps the riskiest are coined "Junk Bonds", which are higher yielding corporate bonds with very low ratings. If you wish to invest in corporate bonds make sure its rating aligns with your risk tolerance. The safest corporates are called "Investment Grade". There are still many other types of bonds out there with varying risks. Another low risk option are municipal bonds, which are generally ideal for investors in a high tax bracket because of the tax exemptions they qualify for. Make sure you fully understand the various provisions in bonds which can increase the risk, ie. call provisions. Also, a general rule of thumb is that the longer the term of the bond the greater the inherent interest rate risk. Hope this helps!

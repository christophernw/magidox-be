Phone a Veterinarian's office, and ask questions of the person who answers the phone.  If she doesn't know she will find out quickly and you'll get the right information you need.  How is the dog's breathing? When did you first notice this? What are the symptoms? If the dog vomits save the vomit for the doctor; if there are stools save a sample.Don't give the dog any food or medicine till you get proper advice. Confine the dog. If your dog gets no freedom you may have less to fear. Dogs given freedom sometimes get into garbage. String in garbage can almost and can truly cut the dog's tongue off but fast attention from the veterinarian can find and prevent the worst sometims. People thoughtlessly leave out chemicals that can poison pets. Act as fast as you can. If after hours for veterinarians you may still get help, and many will answer emergency calls. Whoever answers calls can screen them so you can track down a desperately needed vet even in the middle of the night or on holidays.

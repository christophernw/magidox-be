Because that is in our nature. Since we have brains that act on its own at some level, people (brains) tend to judge everything and that is OK and natural and since people do not know anything about the person they meet or see at the very first moment, they will do the automatic judging with the available information they have and that is sight. Let me give you an example that proves judging does not occur when people look at someone and why it is normal. when you hear some singer on the radio for the very first time and you don't know how he or she looks like, you tend to think (judge) that he or she has a certain type of looks depending on her or his voice until you see that person on TV. It is the same thing; people judge you when they look at you because that is all the info that their brain can get at that instance.

It's unlucky to wish good luck upon an actor or a production. Instead, one should invite disaster; the phrase "Break a leg!" is most commonly used. As with many theatrical superstitions, there are multiple histories. The specific origin of this is unknown. . In the Shakespearean era, if one performed poorly, they would be booed and heckled off-stage, unable to complete the show. If their performance went well, however, they would finish the show, and take a bow. The bow involved a bent knee, creating a "break" in the leg. . It may be a relic of a more general superstition against wishing someone good luck. In "the olden days" people believed that there were mischievous sprites around, and so to stop the sprites from having the opposite effect (bad luck) one would wish the actor the opposite - a superstitious reverse psychology. . The phrase "Break a leg!" may date to Vaudeville days. As the story goes, more actors would be in attendance than were actually necessary. An actor needed to actually appear on stage to be paid, thus "breaking a leg" is to appear on stage, and therefore get paid. (A leg is a type of theatrical masking that hides the wings of the stage). The phrase probably would have moved into the mainstream through the 1920's and 30's movie industry. . Another idea or origin is that, being nervous, an actor's muscles or legs could cramp up, and one could overheat in the costume during a show. In that case, break a leg meant something along the likes of "loosen up, and enjoy the show!"

I totally feel you man. My best friend is Mormon, and I had to go through it... but the bottom line is that if he's your friend, he'll be chill with it. Just tell him at some point when you guys are just hangin out, and the mood is right. Just tell him that you're still you, and that your relationship wont change... just don't hit on him... that'll fcuk things up...

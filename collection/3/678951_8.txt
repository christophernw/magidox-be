Those countries have BANNED drinking.. . We tried banning drinking, it didn't quite work. There was more crime.. . There's nowhere in the bible that bans drinking, even Jesus himself drank wine.. There was water to drink and Jesus turned it into wine.. . The message there is to make more alcohol.. . The bible also says to accept and forgive. It is not your job to judge. If I'm drinking and smoking (which I don't), it's God's job to punish me.

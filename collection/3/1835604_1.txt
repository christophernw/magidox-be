Because we're cool.  We respect the soveriegnty of Kuwait, just as we respect sovereignty of other nations that pose outward threats to us to other nations that share our ideals of personal liberty and freedom.. . Despite what many in the media would have you believe (that we are an agressor and occupier), we are a liberator.  We're like the cool parents that want their kids to grow up to be productive citizens.  We're not like the authoritarian (dictator) parents that wish to control their kids every move even after they become adults.

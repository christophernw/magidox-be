If she is not on any other medications that are for arthritis, and she is not on blood thinners, she can take Ibuprofen or Alleve.  Heat should be applied to the muscle 48 hours after the initial injury (before that you use ice).  However if she is doing things to continue irritating it, she should use ice at the initial time she is irritating it.  If it doesn't get better soon, she might consider physical therapy.

THE "ice balls" you refer to are comets...and they're not quite the "snowballs" that they were made out to be in previous years.  They're more like big rocks...they do emit lots of visible gases so that they make a "tail" as they get closer to the sun.. But not every planet has a suitable environvent for supporting water...nor do they all have identical chemical make-ups.

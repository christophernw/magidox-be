The Conservative Party are planning to just that - collecting motorway tolls, if they get elected.  They plan to (as it were) rent out motorways to companies who will then collect the tolls from vehicles passing thru their toll gates, much as you can see now if you drive north/south over the Dartford Bridge - you go thru a toll gate and pay your fee.. . Tolls on motorways will help reduce traffic flow and stop, I hope, the sort of person who drives say three or four miles on the M-way making a 'local journey' when they could just as easily use a non M-way route.

While it might cause a slight loss of  performance short term, really it shouldn't permanently damage your fuel system. I do, however, recommend that you dilute it asap by gassing up full. And then with the next tankful add a container of fuel injector cleaner to remove any oil residue which may have settled on your fuel injectors, because of this error you made.

I agree, you cannot.  A corporation must be represented by a lawyer.  I just successfully threw out a case where the corporation's president tried to represent the corp.  The case was thrown out because the corporation had no lawyer.  . . The laws are different in every state but it is highly possible that your state will not even allow you to represent the corporation.

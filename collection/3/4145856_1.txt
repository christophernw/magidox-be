They no speaka the langauge.Mexicans need to realize that when General Sam Houston captured Santa Anna he could have just killed him and invaded what is present day Mexico,instead he spared his life and purchased Texas.Later on he sold us more land.Mexicans tend to forget that their country was also invaded by the Spanish in the search for gold.They inslaved and slaughtered the Inca and Aztec tribes.I have a step-mother from Mexico who is very much just a typical Mexican,that believes that Texas still belongs to Mexico and that every white person owes her something.Nevermind that 98% of her family is here illegally soaking up a free education and whatever wellfare they can get by having babies on US soil,while dealing dope from their HUD homes.To me they are like a cancer that is killing our society slowly over time.

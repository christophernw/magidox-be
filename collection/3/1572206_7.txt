You have to remember that people who live in Chicago do not generally "shop" during the winter. they know where things are at and get in and get out. Yes, we dress for the weather as well. In the summer, when all the tourists are here, THAT is when people shop. Oh and during christmas too! It's so pretty then you forget the cold anyways.

wow i see how some people have been conditioned to think like that. mayb e they do want money for drugs or alcohol, look at them, how can they stay positive when they have nothing. some do try but its a disease only ppl with it would understand. im an alcoholic and im not homeless. usually i buy them food and the ones that need (money for drugs like u said) appreciate it.. . DONT STEREOTYPE OR JUDGE,,,,,,KEEP WALKING AND I WILL HELP THEM IF YOU JUST WANT TO POKE JOKES. U ARENT IN THEIR SHOES

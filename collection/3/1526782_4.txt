mouse flavored cat food? who needs that? try this kitty stew for your finicky feline (works on dogs too, believe it or not): cook oatmeal or BROWN rice in chicken broth (believe it or not, VERY flavorful). When cooked, add FROZEN veggys (NOT canned)- green pea, stringbean, corn, carrot mix is good. Add tablespoon of canola or olive oil. Add can of packed in water fish or poultry.

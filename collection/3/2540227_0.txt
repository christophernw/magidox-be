The pancreas has two jobs.  First there is the exocrine pancreas that releases proteases and lipases into the small intestine to aid in digestion.  Second there is the endocrine pancreas that senses blood sugar and releases insulin.  It is this part of the pancreas that is injured by the immune system to create the condition that is known as type one diabetes.

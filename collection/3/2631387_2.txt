The wrist is surrounded by a band of fibrous tissue that functions as a support for the joint. The tight space between this fibrous band and the wrist bone is called the carpal tunnel. The median nerve passes through the carpal tunnel to receive sensations from the thumb, index, and middle fingers of the hand. Any condition that causes swelling or a change in position of the tissue within the carpal tunnel can squeeze and irritate the median nerve. Irritation of the median nerve causes tingling and numbness of the thumb, index, and the middle fingers.  Stinging and burning can also occur. . . The cause of the condition is no known.   Any condition that exerts pressure on the median nerve at the wrist can cause carpal tunnel syndrome. Common conditions that can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome include obesity, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, arthritis, diabetes, and trauma. . Tendon inflammation  from repetitive work, such as  typing or assembly line factory work can also cause carpal tunnel symptoms. Carpal tunnel syndrome  is noted to be one of the most common repetitive stress injuries. . Some rare diseases can cause deposits of abnormal substances in and around the carpal tunnel, leading to nerve irritation. These diseases include amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, multiple myeloma and leukemia.. .

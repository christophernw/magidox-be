Assuming you are talking about the planets that orbit our sun... the new ones that are so far out there that there is debate whether they are even in our solar system, or even planets for that matter... I believe there is what?  13 planets now?  Its interesting to know that many of the planets were known hundreds to thousands of years by astronomers and astrologers in ancient times... well before they were discovered by modern scientist.  Pluto, the ninth, was only 'discovered' in the early 1900's (I might be wrong about that)... however, as many as ten planets can be seen in some ancient documents of heavenly bodies.  That is in fact where the first nine planets got their name from, ancient peoples who knew them... perhaps the "newly discovered" ones were also already named thousands of years ago.. . If you are talking about the planets that orbit other stars, California Bears answer is correct.

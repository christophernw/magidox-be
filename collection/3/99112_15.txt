Maybe you're afraid of "failure," just like those who procrastinate. In this case, it's tough to try to make a good impression on a person if you've ever been humiliated by someone else. For example, maybe you asked a girl to go steady with you and got turned down in front of her (or your) friends. It's tough to face stuff like that if there's an audience, so it makes you less likely to try meeting other people, whether or not you're looking for a "steady.". . My advice is to swallow whatever fear you may feel about meeting other people and just try starting a casual conversation here and there. Everyone's different in some fashion, so you needn't worry so much about what someone else thinks of what you do nor whom you choose as friends - if you're not hurting yourself nor anyone else in any way (legally, morally, ethically) and you're happy with what you're doing, then keep it up.. . Good luck.

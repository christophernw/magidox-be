You might have a cavity. Or you just might have a big filling. Some teeth that have big fillings might  be sensitive for a month or two after being done. If you haven't been to a dentist in a while I advice you to go. You don't wanna wait, becasue then you might have a root canal and it is expensive.The sooner you go the better!

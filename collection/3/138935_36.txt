it depends on the source of the problem, but if you can take it try putting some rubbing alchol on a q-tip and hold it on the soar for a minute(full 60 sec) or so this will alow the alchol to soak into the skin killing bacteria as it does. it will also dehydrate the surface skin causing it to become more tough and basicly help close the wound.

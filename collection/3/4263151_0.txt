The Sun burns hydrogen in its core.  When the core hydrogen is depleted, gravity causes the core to compress.  This in turn causes helium burning at the core, stopping the compression.  The additional heat causes a ring of hydrogen to start burning outside the core.. . The additional radiation pressure causes the outer atmosphere of the Sun (or any solar-mass star) to expand, causing it to cool and turn redder.  Thus the star expands into a red giant, although the core is intensely hot.

There are differences between every Christian religion.  It not really even possible to compare Mormonism to Christianity in general because almost every major doctrine that people have a problem with (non-trinitarianism, additional scripture, theosis, creatio ex nihilo, etc) is present in some other Christian religion as well.. . Consider: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman. . People can accurately say "Mormons beleive they can become Gods", but they inaccurately convey the idea that this the topic of many of our sermons.  Mormons know about this teaching, but they don't sit and plan what their gonna do with their Godlike powers.  All Christions beleive that there is a reward in heaven.  Mormons just beleive it's something more that simply being in God's presence for eternity.  That's just an example.

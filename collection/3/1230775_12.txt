Actually, your above statement is not true.  A lot of third wold countries with muslim populations struggle with education, but not because of their religion - it's due to their economic situation.. . Regimes like the Taliban are responsible for spreading misguided views, unfortunately.  Saudi is full of extremely well educated women, along with many other countries.. . You will find that with the rise of Islam centuries ago, Universities flourished and the spread of knowledge travelled like wild fire across the globe.

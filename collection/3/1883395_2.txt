It's terrible for the health. Particularly for the brain and nerves system.  Scientists tried deprivation of sleep and deprivation of food on two people simultaneously & apparently, the person who was deprived of sleep deteriorated badly after 11 days (became a complete zombie & could not even stand up).  The person who was deprived of food was fine for 14 days.. . In a nutshell, sleep is the brains' food, without it a person could not function, and a lot of health problems will rappidly occur with excessive lack of sleep.  One will also look & get older quickly as there would be no proper regeneration of vital cells in the body.. . I hope this answer has convinced you enough to get good hours of sleep.

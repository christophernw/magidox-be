Repent means to turn away from, to make a 180ยบ turn from what you were doing wrong.. . Yes, you will slip up!  We are human.  Only Jesus was perfect, which is why He alone could die for our sins.  Repent of your sin, ask God's forgiveness, and rely on Him to hlep you not do it again.  "Feeling awful" can be prodding of the Holy Spirit to repent.. . Sometimes the hardest part of repenting is *accepting* that forgiveness that God will alwasys grant to you.  He tells us He forgets our sin!  Can you imagine?!  He tosses them into the sea, as far away as the east is from the west!  He is mighty, omniscient (knows everything) yet CHOOSES to forget our sins that we've confessed!  So accept his forgiveness.  Do not carry that burden around, OK?  God has forgiven you once you repent;  Now forgive yourself.

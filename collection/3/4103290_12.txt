Wigan Pier is most famous for the Wigan Pier Casino (at the far end of the Pier), which used to be (possibly still is now) a music hall in the 1920s and 30s. Changing with the times, it became a nightclub, in the 1960s which was the UK's premier Northern Soul mightspot, and continued at least into the 1990s, where it also hosted several legal raves.. . Hope this helps!

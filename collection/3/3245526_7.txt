Well for many reasons. My main reason is because I want to see who's getting on the elevator. It would suck to have my back turned and just my luck someone runs in there on a stabbing frenzy (anything could happen). Another reason, it's the way that you're leaving out and that's where all of your information is located. The only reason you're turned that way is to get in there in the first place. If it was meant for us to be turned that way, all of the buttons and other information would be facing in that direction.

in order to make charge flow from one position to another it is necessary that one point is at higher potential that is it should have more no.of electrons.everything moves from higher potential to lower potential.for ex-from your tap water always flows from higher to lower.hence.it is necessary that one point should be at ahigher potential than the other point.

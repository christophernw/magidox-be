Do a search on google for glider models....  sailplane models...  gliding.. soaring.. you'll find some good designs and building ideas there.  I've been gliding for years and I have built some models too... using the right materials makes a big difference... a long wingspan as well allows for more lift to be generated by the wings which will increase it's time aloft.  Make sure you build adjustable elevators and rudder into it too so you can adjust it as necessary.. Good luck!

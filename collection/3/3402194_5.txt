Moulin Rouge (French for "red mill") is a traditional cabaret, built in 1889 by Joseph Oller who already owned the Paris Olympia. Situated in the red-light district of Pigalle on Boulevard de Clichy in the 18th arrondissement, near Montmartre, Paris, France, it is famous for the large red imitation windmill on its roof. The Moulin Rouge is a symbol of French Culture as well as the Bohemian influence on Western Europe. The building has a rich history that is still being added to today. Over the past hundred years, the Moulin Rouge has remained a popular tourist destination for many visitors each year. Today the Moulin Rouge offers musical dance entertainment for adult visitors from around the world. Much of the romance from turn-of-the-century France is still present in the interior environment.. . The design and name of Paris's Moulin Rouge has often been imitated by other night clubs worldwide.. . Notable performers at the Moulin Rouge have included La Toya Jackson, La Goulue, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Yvette Guilbert, Jane Avril, Mistinguett, Le PÃ©tomane, Edith Piaf and others. The Moulin Rouge was also the subject of many paintings by post-impressionist painter Toulouse Lautrec who in turn romanticized the building.. . "Moulin Rouge" was also the title of a book by Pierre La Mure. This book was the basis for the 1952 movie of the same name. It was also the name of the 2001 film starring Jim Broadbent, Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, John Leguizamo and Kylie Minogue. Both films were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, but neither won the award.

I think the long winded  guy above is wrong. Son of a gun is actually a misreading of Son of a son. In old typefaces, the small "s" resembled a "g". Somewhere along the line son of a son (or grandson) became son of a gun due to illiterate interpretation. Afterwards ,the son of a gun became more widely used as an insult. . Woman were never allowed on ships ,it was considered very bad luck ,so the other answer is not accurate.

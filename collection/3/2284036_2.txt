Of course evil things are attractive and interesting ... if they were disgusting, would you do it without good reason to have to? lol. . James wrote "Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempteth no man: but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed. Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is fullgrown, bringeth forth death.  Be not deceived, my beloved brethren.". . Without that initial temptation, we would not sin and be perfect ... and you know satan can't handle anything like that! lol

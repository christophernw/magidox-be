Hydrochloric Acid or HCl (aq) has a pH of 1 - which such as, as a strong acid, the Hydrogen, being the proton donor, has a very strong ionic bonding with the Cl ion. As a result, the Hydrogen will not accept the electrons to itself, and so it will not form a covalent bond with another element. As a result the pH will not be increased to 7. You will only be diluting the HCl, making the concentration less, but within the diluted mixture, HCl ions will still be present, thus the property of its pH will not change.

Third law.     To every action (force applied) there is an equal and opposite reaction (equal force applied in the opposite direction)..     Another way of stating Newton's third law, an interaction between two objects, is that, if object A exerts a force on object B, object B will exert the same magnitude force on A, but in the opposite direction.

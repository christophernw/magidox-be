Electromagnetics.. . http://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e397/Bigpappadiaz/magcur.gif. . Apparently scientists have been able to unify weak force, strong force and electromagnetics but gravity is still the one remaining mystery.  I don't know why, since the answer is so damn obvious.. . This guy below me doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.  The Earth has a massive magnetic field, doesn't it?  We have a natural electric field as well.  Where do you think the charge separation for lightning comes from?. . http://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e397/Bigpappadiaz/discharge.gif. . We get auroras on our magnetic poles every time the solar "wind" comes flowing in, which we KNOW are electrical in nature.  They closely resemble elves, which are glowing rings rippling across our ionosphere.  We are simply a charged body spinning around in the magnetic field of the Sun, which is much more powerful than our planet.. . It'll be discovered that gravity = electromagnetism some day, and it'll be with a big, massive "DUH!"

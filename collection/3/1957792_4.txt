I think every one does not have to believe the way I do.. . It becomes a problem when people begin to believe others have no right to believe differently than themselves. They start trying to force beliefs. That's not alright to do.. . So, if they meant it as an insult, then it would be one. If they simply believe Muhammed is the most noble prophet, then it has nothing to do with my belief of Jesus Christ.

It mainly depends on the pressure (if we are talking about pure water). The higher the pressure, the higher the boiling point - it can be much lower (ex. high in the mountains) or much higher than 100 degrees C (the boiling point under normal atmospheric pressure). If we don't talk about pure water, then adding other chemicals (for example, table salt - sodium chloride) can raise the boiling point as well.

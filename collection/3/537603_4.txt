There was a scene in an old movie, Moby Dick, when Captain Ahab, played by Gregory Peck, who reached out to his second in command and said, 'come here, Starbuck, let me look into a human eye. 'Tis better than to gaze into sea or sky'. And, then asked, 'why do you tremble so, Starbuck?' . . 'Because', said Starbuck, 'I do not have the bowels to slaughter thee and save the whole ship from thy dying hand'.. . In the movie, Scarface, Al Pacino tells his partner as they were driving home from a night out on the town, 'he's soft, that chick likes me'.. . 'Yea, how do you know that.'. . 'The eyes, they never lie.'. . We romanticize, criticize, fantasize and theorize about the eyes. So, why should beauty be any different. It's all in the eyes.

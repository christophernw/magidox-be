I haven't found much capable of helping my migraines.  They are terrible and I really wish I didn't have to suffer through them.  >.>. . Try eating (and seriously) a jalapeno pepper.  Sometimes the spices release endorphins and it helps.. . Go see a doctor.  Maybe you can get something that helps you from a prescription.. . Also, if you wear contacts, take them out when you get one and put your glasses on.  It might help.

This compound is commonly known as foam rubber. . A light firm spongy rubber made by beating air into latex and then curing it. Foam rubber has a wide range of uses including upholstery and insulation.. . Ethylene-vinyl acetate (also known as EVA or sometimes simply as "acetate") is the copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate. It is a polymer that approaches elastomeric materials in softness and flexibility, yet can be processed like other thermoplastics. The material has good clarity and gloss, barrier properties, low-temperature toughness, stress-crack resistance, hot-melt adhesive and heat sealing properties and resistance to UV radiation. EVA has little or no odor and is competitive with rubber and vinyl products in many electrical applications.

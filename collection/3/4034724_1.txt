I pick ones that the glycemic index indicate are "low glycemic", so they don't raise my blood sugar.  I mainly eat fresh or cooked green leafy vegetables, but sometimes I eat fresh baby carrots (even though they are "high glycemic".  Cabbage and cauliflower are also on my regular eat list, as well as canned beans.

I guess you are talking about the telephone ringing?. . Our dog used to confuse the phone ringing with the door bell ringing and would run to the front door.. . If you mean the door bell ringing, the dog is very smart in certain things. He in this case is making sure that no harm will come to you if he can do anything about it.. . We have hunted fox with a pack of dogs. We were standing at the edge of a field, Two of our pack dogs came out of the woods and stopped about 20 feet from where we were. The fox ran out of the woods right between the two dogs. It was like the dogs knew where the fox was going to come out the woods.

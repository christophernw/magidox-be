Some people like working at a zoo or a water park.  They learn customer service skills, sales techniques, and how to speak to customers.. .

It still teaches you about how to relate to the public, as well as how the fashiion industry works, as well as some sales experience.. . Perosnally,. . I have had several summer jobs,. repairing outboard boat motors. pumping gas at a marina. working the cash register at my grandparents grocery store. working for a contractor as a laborer. working for a bank as a software tester.. . Write down a list of things you like to do, both working outside or inside.  Remember that is you work outside you may have to  work outside for 8 hours a day.

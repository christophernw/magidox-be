You can't really find your body fat just from your weight and stats. I can give you a rough estimate, although I have no idea what frame size you have or how much muscle. If you have an average size frame and average amount of muscle, I'm guessing your body fat is pretty low, maybe around 15%, because you are a little bit too light for your height. HTH.

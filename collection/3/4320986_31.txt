I am an an atheist and yes, I too am moral. I am not sure what you mean by doing the right thing even  when it doesn't benefit me. I believe doing the right thing does benefit me. I care about how my actions effect others. I am a very empathetic person. If I cheat on my partner I know this would hurt, I would hate for someone I care so deeply about to be less than happy. If I steal I am hurting whom ever possessed the item before me. If I slander or abuse anyone by any means I know this causes harm. If you mean cheat as in tests, I do not do this because I have a sense of pride and self worth. I know That I can do what is needed without resorting to cheating. I would like to think other people, regardless of their religion, would have the same decency. . Is this the kind of moral you were speaking of? If not can you please refine what it is you mean. I don't think you are ignorant or naive. I think it is a good thing that you are trying to understand an others point of view.

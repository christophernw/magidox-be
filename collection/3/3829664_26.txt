That's a good question.  Truely the best reason, as bad is it may sound is that you're a hypocrite.  As you know, the reason Christmas should be celebrated is for Jesus' birthday, if you don't believe in Christmas, you shouldn't celebrate.  Sorta like the Brits don't celebrate the 4th of July, to them, it's just another day.  So if you are truely hard on your beliefs, you should volunteer to work on Christmas, you shouldn't be doing anything else. . . Try telling that to your kids someday.  "Sorry dear, we don't believe in God and Jesus, so you don't get any presents like all your friends".  That one will be fun.

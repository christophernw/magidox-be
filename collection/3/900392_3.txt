Unless there is actual dog poop in the flower bed, there shouldn't be a smell.  Look for renegade poopies and pick them up.  If you can't find any, and it still smells, consider planting marigolds.  They have a strong smell that will cover up the poo smell.  As an added bonus, rabbits don't like them so they'll act like a natural rabbit fence and keep the bunnies from eating the rest of your flowers.

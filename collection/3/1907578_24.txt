because the atmosphere is really relaxing and comfortable, plus a lot of people just do it because it's trendy. but I think to be able to drink a nice hot cup of tea, coffe whatever you like in a nice couchy chair, and just forgot about what I did all day and how stressfull it was, and how many things I had to do for people I don't like, and for how many things I had to pick up and drop off, you just need to let your hair down and pick that coffee off that wooden table in that coffee shop and escape from everything, is just something you can't compare to. and coffee doesn't give everyone energy, like decaf, you know what I mean.

If you have good friends, that will help you tremendously. Try spending more time with friends, just relax, go to a nice restaurant with your friends for lunch or dinner, sit there, have a drink and have fun... Also try any sport you like, try joining to a Tennis club, Bowling club, or something you like, and spend as much time as you can trying to ace it. It will get your mind off of it.

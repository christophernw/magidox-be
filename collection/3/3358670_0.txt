Agreed, we pay for homeowners insurance, I have a leaky roof and the first thing out of their mouth, this was a preexisting condition, sorry but we can't do it. WHAT! Then why am I giving you my money then? Well because all of the fat cats on capital hill say we have to have it in order to buy a house, that great so once again someone else is getting rich off of me.

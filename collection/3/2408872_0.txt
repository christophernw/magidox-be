HM Queen's speech from the throne in the House of Lords is not her own, it was written for her by the Government, Tony Blair.  The speech made by the Queen is part of the State Opening of Parliament ceremony.  No law enacted in Parliament can become actual law until the Queen signs it.  The Queen is Head of State in UK and until there is a revolution, which would overthrow the monarchy, that's how we do things.. . God save the Queen.  Long Live the Queen.

well it's not a casual thing to ask. i really don't have any advice. just make sure that you know you won't be getting into any kind of trouble by making that sort of remark. some places have a don't ask dont' tell policy (work) if it's a friend then i'm sure you should know them well enough to be comfortable with asking such a question.

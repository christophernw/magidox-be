I think you have some major issues with God, and you need to get thoughs worked out.  Christans are not stupid, they are doing the right thing with turning their life over to God.  God gave us free will and with that there will be people that choose evil.  Thats their choice, but when they make that choice it hurts God very much because he loves all of us.

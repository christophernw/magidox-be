We had a stinky co-worker -not boss- a few years ago, and we had his assistant put deodorant in his desk drawer.  It didn't help- he still had b.o.  Finially, a girl who sat next to him, asked him if he got the deodorant, and he said yes.  She asked him why have'nt you used it?  He said, oh, I thought it was a practical joke.. But seriously, I don't think you can tell your boss to take a shower and it's not really your place to.  Maybe you could let someone who is an equal to him know there is a problem and they can talk to him.

I think we have to go back to the big bang theory of the universe... After the big bang there was a lot of debris and just by chance there was some spinning stuff where the centre of the earth was and also where the moon was.. Because they were fairly big lumps of dirt the attracted smaller lumps of dirt from nearby and slowly built up to become the moon and planet earth.. . The reason why the two planets are here is because of gravity. They both attract each other because of their masses. However, because the moon is orbiting the earth, it wants to shoot off into space at a tangent to it's orbital path. It's the gravitaional attraction which is nicely balanced with the centripetal acceleration of the moons orbit.

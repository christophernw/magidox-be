the problem would be, that no matter the reason you are dieting it wouldn't really help you to weigh less on the moon.  For example, if you are dieting to be more healthy...the weight you should be at on the moon would also be affected by that 6 times lighter ratio, so that won't help you.  If it is to look better in a certain pair of pants that you love...well same thing, your mass will be the same, you still fit the pants the same.  The only weight you would really be loosing going to the moon would be from your bones and muscles becoming weaker from the lack of resistance from the weight there is on earth...which I am guessing is not the type of weight that you would want to be loosing.

in part because of liberal sponsored programs to make clean needles availiable to IV drug users instead of spending our tax dollars to arrest and rehabilitate users and incarcerate dealers. Sure the cops do what they can but with the democrats passing out needles and sending the message that we will look the other way when they shoot up so long as they come get more free needles for the next high the cops are fighting a losing battle.. . I say grab the doper, put them in a padded room and let them go through DT's. if they die, tuff crap. if they live they will not be in any hurry to ride that ride again. If they do, ding ding, round two with DT's.... sooner or later they will learn or die.

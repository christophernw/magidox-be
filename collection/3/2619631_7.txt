The short answer is that they fight wars on my say so.  I created the US because there were too many idiots running countries and screwing everything up.  The US now rules supreme and they are the world's police.  I sent the US (to V.N.) not to attack but to defend the good people there.  Then all these bleeding heart liberals, like yourself, mucked things up.

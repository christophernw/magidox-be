Hire someone ;). . or.... . If it is simple enough to be an animated gif there used to be a program called Gifanimation that was super easy to learn.. . You can try Macromedia Fireworks or Adobe Image Ready. It's really easy to do gif animations in both programs. Especially if you know Photoshop because it uses alot of the same tools and has a similar interface.. . A quick spin through the animation tutorial in both programs and you'll be making animated gifs in minutes.. . If the animation is long with scene changes I recommend breaking it up into a few animations.. . Good luck and have fun!!!!

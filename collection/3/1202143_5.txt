Oxygen does not accelerate fire, it is the neccssary component for combustion.When Hydrogen burns, there has to be Oxygen present or it won't burn.What alot of people don't realize is that burning(scientifically known as combustion)is actually a type of chemical reaction.When Hydrogen burns, oxygen has to be present because it is chemically fusing with the Hydrogen.So yes, with the right chemicals, fire actually creates water.

Depends on the kind of plant. If it is a desert-adapted plant, it can avoid excessive heat by orienting its leaves vertically to minimize heat load or leaves can be extremely hairy to reflect sunlight that would cause leaves to heat up. Other plants in more mesic conditions just transpire a lot of water through their leaves, which is a little like our sweating.

That depends if you filed income taxes for 2004.. If you didn't, then your adjusted gross income (AGI) will be zero.. If you did, look at which 1040 form you filled out.. You should have a copy of your 2004 taxes.. If you filed 1040EZ, the amount on line 4 is your AGI.. If you filed 1040A, the amount on line 21 is your AGI.. If you filed 1040, the amount on line 36 is your AGI.. If you lost a copy of your 2004 income taxes, you can either contact the person who did your taxes or call the IRS.

well theres a few ways you can do this, triceps are the easy part, this can be solved by some pushups if you dont have weights if you do; pick a weight that you can controll hold it over you head in one hand straight up, place your oposite hand on the inside of your elbow and let it drop behind your head picking it up at a fast but controlled tempo. do 3 or 4 sets of 12 repitions that should tone up quick. For the stomach, the only way to do that is to exercise, eat less or not at all after 7, lower your carbs and raise protein intake. You already have the muscles just fat over them, but if you want the muscles to be even more toned you can do reverse crunches, 6 inches, full sit ups, also about 30 minutes of medium to high intensity cardio

John Hancock is an essential part of the Independence story. Early on he was one of the leaders against the Stamp and Townsend Acts. He was instrumental in the Construction of the Articles of Confederation.. . But most importantly he is the largest signature on the Declaration of Independence. The men who sign the Declaration knew that if their efforts failed their participation in this rebellion would mean that they would be tried for treason, strip of all land and titles, and be put to death. John Hancock made his signature the largest because in his belief in the budding idea of Democracy and he wanted no mistakes made, should they fail, that he was in fact a patriot and would always stand in opposition of the throne.

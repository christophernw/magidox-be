Because he solved all the great problems of philosophy - twice ! . . [Seriously, if you are thinking of doing it, start off with something like 'On Certainty' - it's fairly accessible and gives you a good introduction to where he's coming from.  The section's in 'Philosophical Investigations' on the so-called 'private language argument' are pretty central and amenable too.  . . However, before you embark on reading Wittgenstein, make sure you've got a good grasp of Descartes, Plato, Locke and Hume - they're kind of what he's kicking against.. . Don't even think of starting off with the Tractatus - you won't make it past the first couple of propositions before losing the will to live!]

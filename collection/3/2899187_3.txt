Chinese tea. why? it's delicious, and also good for health. you can be thinner, and you can have great skin... . Japanese tea is also good.. it's a unique kind of tea, it's green, but it's not green tea.. . speaking of green tea, green tea is also good after eating so many fats. they help to burn it up faster... . basically I like all of the tea i had written,as long as it doesnt contain sugar.. ^^

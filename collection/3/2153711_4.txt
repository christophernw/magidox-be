i wish i could tell you.. my cat does the same thing, although now it has gotten worse because she chews on cards, pictures and anything with a glossy feel. (she even chews on plastic bags from the grocery store!).  I have had to get rid of all pictures that are not in frames because she will chew them all up!. I think they like the way it feels on their tongue.  My vet said its kinda like how dogs like to chew bones; they just want something to chew on!

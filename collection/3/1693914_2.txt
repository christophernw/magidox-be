Petrified wood is wood that has been replaced by quartz, or silica as it is better known...Trees became burried by volcanic ash...Water then percolated down through the ash carrying mineral rich silica with it...In time, the silica formed quartz whithin the tree...Opals from Northern Nevada are formed in the same way, as replacements of wood...

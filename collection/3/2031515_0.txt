am a 17+ year retired RN AND a bipolar....hun, u need to seek professional help from your local mental health clinic & immediately you should call your local crisis hotline who may recommend u go to the ER....u probably suffer from a form of severe depression & there ARE medicines to get you through this & that will maintain you after the crisis.... . PLEASE DON'T SEEK A PERMANENT NON-SOLUTION TO A TEMPORARY PROBLEM.... been there, done that....i'm here, i'm happy & damn glad I didn't do it...God Bless You...keep me posted on your progress    igiveupuchuzit@yahoo.co.uk

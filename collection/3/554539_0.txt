First and foremost I read for enjoyment.  Books can help you escape a mundane existence - they can educate you - they can entertain you - they can thrill you - they can frighten you - they can expand your horizons - they can expand your vocabulary - they can relax you - they can make you tense - they can be what you look forward to opening first chance you get - they can be sadly missed once you have finished the last chapter - they can be revisited like an old friend - and they can make you knowledgeable on an awful lot of subjects - and they can adorn your bookshelves. Take your pick!

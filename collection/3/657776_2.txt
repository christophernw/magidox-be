Well it's a girl thing.  Guy's got their thing like not talking as much or telling nasty jokes. We don't really know why we go together. And one of us don't use the bathroom and make the other wipe. We aren't like that. I guess we just go so we can talk and check our makeup or get opinions on our hair. It's just like that.

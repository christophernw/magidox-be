It is undisputed that the Messiah must be of the genetic lineage of David.  But the biblical prophecies could not be used today to identify the Messiah because the genealogical records that are necessary for linking him with the tribe of Judah and the house of David are nonexistent. They were destroyed with the temple in the year 70 C.E.  No Jewish male today could trace with any degree of reliability his lineage as would be required for the Messiah.  The national genealogies kept at the temple were destroyed.  Regarding the destruction of the temple and the archives, the book History of the Jewish People by Max Margolis and Alexander Marx says on pages 202, 203: “Titus hastened to inspect the Temple. But soon the sacred edifice was the prey of the flames which the Romans kept alive. . . . So Titus had the quarter occupied by his soldiers burned down: the council house, the hall of archives, the whole of the lower city down to the Pool of Siloam.” The Bible Cyclopædia by M’Clintock and Strong states: “But there can be little doubt that the registers of the Jewish tribes and families perished at the destruction of Jerusalem, and not before.”. . Moreover, any would-be Messiah must, of necessity, come through the lineage of David and Solomon because of the promise God made to David.  See 2 Samuel 7:12-16.  But any would-be Messiah who did come physically through David, through Solomon, through Asa, and the kingly line (David's lineage) on down through Jeconiah would be under the same curse of Jeremiah 22:24-30 and therefore be disqualified.

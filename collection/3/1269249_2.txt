i had a close call...i was very scared because i was raped by a complete stranger and didnt/still dont know 100% if im alright. there are a lot of support groups that you could go to...even some online ones. i suggest you do that so you dont feel so alone. you will be able to talk to people going through the same things as you are and it will provide a more comfortable environment for you. im so sorry for you, but rather than focusing on the negative...please try and turn it around and make yourself a better person. help educate others, talk to people...that could be therapeutic as well. i do know that there are website out there that have "forum" type set-ups and can hook you up with people to talk to. if you believe in God, i also suggest prayer. God bless you and know that you are not at all alone.

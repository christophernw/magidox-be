they have sex and then lay eggs which are called spawn. the larvae or tadpoles emerge and metamorphose into frogs (they grow legs).. . the tadpoles are totally aquatic and have gills, which are lost as metamorphosis progresses. in salamanders the larval stage is called a axylotle and can remain in the larval stage for many yaers until a hormonal change in the water stars the change in development, this is a tactic enebling the salamnder to wait until the optimum time to reproduce, and cut out the chance of progressing to adulthood with no mates around to fertilize.

Somalia is one of the most dysfuctional countries in the world. By remaining dysfunctional, it creates havoc in the region (Spreading violence, terrorism, crime, killing, pirates, islamic warlords crossing into other countries, etc.). . . Case in point - There were pirates off of Somalia that tried to take over a cruise ship. . . America, and the coalition forces left Somalia alone and Somalia still can't establish stability. America has tried to help and Somalia rejects the help .... too bad for Somalia and the people there. . . In my opinion ... America is keeping its distance but will  maintain safety and freedom of navigation of the ocean areas off the Somalia coast.

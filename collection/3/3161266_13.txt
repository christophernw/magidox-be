Not turn your homework, and when they ask why say that your dog ate it or your little brother/sister ate it. You could also skip class, show up late, talk back, if you have a bad grade and they ask you, "Do you like your average?" (which they will ask if you don't turn in homework and especially if you had a bad average,) say yes.

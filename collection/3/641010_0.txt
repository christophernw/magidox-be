Iwo Jima is significant because of WWII's Battle Of Iwo Jima. The island was of value to the U.S. from a strategic standpoint. They were already taking over a good portion of the Pacific theater, and Iwo Jima was a step closer to the main islands of Japan. In Imperial Japan's eyes, the loss of the island signaled that their defeat was close at hand.

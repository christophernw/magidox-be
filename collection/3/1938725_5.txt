We have a Westie who started scratching and actually was pulling his hair out of his back haunches.  Our Vet checked him out and felt he had developed an allergy to something.  He was given a cortisone shot and we gave the dog 25mg of Benedryl every day for several weeks. This seems to have helped some. Now we are in the process of having blood tests done to determine what the allergy is and help us to know what additional actions we need to take.  I advise you to take you dog to the Vet for a check up!  You both will feel better!

Have you ever noticed that even the message delivery time shown in your mobile phone is much different than the actual, more particular with Hutch. Don't worry, what i believe is that when the call centre and message centres send us the calls and messages after processing through their computers, the time we receive is the time stored in the computer machines of these centres as the actual (reprocessed) message is sent from their machines only.

There wasn't an ancient greek state to give citizenships. . In the ancient greek city - states you were becoming a citizen only by blood (if your father was an Athenean you was going to become Athenean citizen).. . The ancient greeks knew better and they never gave citizenship to barbarians and believers of stupid religions...

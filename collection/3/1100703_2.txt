The Palestinians are killing innocent civilians in purpose. They are not attacking targets of a military or strategic value.. . Although the killings of Israel are indiscriminated in many instances (and here you have to keep in mind the situation in the Palestinian territories where Palestinian fighters are embedded in the comunities in a highly densely populated area) they are at lest nominaly aimed at  military oposition of some kind. . . Israel does not plant bombs in random places and then detonates them to kill indiscriminately.. . Those differences should be explained somehow, and it satisfies me if the Palestinians that fight this way are described so harshly.. . This is not to say that Israel deserves support, what they are doing  to Palestinians as a people is unspeakable, but that does not mean that the Palestinians are using any moraly palatable tactics to fight back.

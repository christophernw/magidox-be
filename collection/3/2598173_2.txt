It would depend on how the law was worded.  Canada has two official languages (English and French) and has an Official Languages Act that spells out the rights Canadians have regarding both languages.  And let me tell you, it can get pretty complicated.. . I think in the case of the US, the difference would be fairly minor.  It wouldn't stop literature and services from being provided in other languages (a lot of that is decided at the state level), but it might create a sitation where someone cannot say he or she has the "right" to something or another in their native language, esp. if that language is one spoken by a vast minority.  (I'm thinking like maybe an African dialect or something.). . I'm in favor of it, but given that I don't necessarily trust politicians, I would be wary of the wording of the law.

A Bachelor's Degree from an accredited university, and then a teacher's education program.  You have to maintain a certain grade point average and meet certain legal standards. You get fingerprinted and take a few teacher exam type tests.  . . It will vary from state to state (and country to country).. . The best place to look is at a website for a university near where you live.  There are Bachelor's degree programs you can take where you major in education and meet some of the teacher education requirements while pursuing your BA degree.. . If you are wanting to teach elementary school, you pursue a multiple subjects credential. If you want to teach high school, you need a single subject credential. With a single subject (like science) you have to take a lot of classes in that specific subject so you have enough knowledge to teach it.. . It takes at least 4 years to get a BA degree, and another year to complete the credential program.

Your advice comes from not understanding war.  We drop bombs to soften them up.  Imagine the Army Saddam had in Iraq, 500,000 troops. The USA had roughly 100,000 so each American has to kill 5 people.  Those are bad odds for fighting.  By dropping bombs and taking out their means to fight we hope to ensure a swift victory.  The faster the victory the less people will die.  As a war wages on from day to day more people will die.  If a war is short, in the long run less will die.  . . The USA has one of the best military's when it comes to ground combat.  What is to say that the others are not fighting fair?  Is it right to fight an enemy face to face like ww1, and ww2?  Millions died in those wars.  Is it right to set a bomb and then detonate it as a medical convoy comes by?  Wars are not fair, and people die.  . . Nobody wins a war by dying for their country, they win a war by making someone else die for their country.  Whatever way we do it, we want to win. Is it right to start a war by flying a plane into a building?  Is it right to win the war by dropping A-bombs?  Maybe not but in both cases it got results.

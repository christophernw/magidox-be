A Steady diet of worms only is not healthy. Wild robins eat bugs as well. I have raised many wild birds using cat food. I would soak the dry cat food until it was just moist, not mushy, and insert small pieces down the throat with some blunt tweezers until the crop or breast looks poochy and full. Doing this about every hour or two at first.

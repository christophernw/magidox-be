If you're eating a lot, but not gaining weight, it sounds like you just have a high metabolism (or maybe you're a teen-ager?). I suppose if it's really extreme you might check with your doctor and make sure you don't have a tapeworm.. . If everything seems okay, though, try drinking more water. I've seen a lot of recommendations of 8 glasses a day (about 64 oz.). That should help create a feeling of fullness.. . Some people suggest even more water, like double that -- 128 oz a day, for someone trying to lose weight. It doesn't sound like you wan't to lose weight, though.

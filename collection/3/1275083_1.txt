Don't think so, there was an article I read a few years back that they have discovered that space actually is layered upon layers, with a rippling effect and instead of expanding into nothingness it is actually continuing to grow wider and deeper.  Quite a concept.  I wish I could find that article for you it surely would broaden your mind on the subject.. . However, logic tells me that there is something beyond what you call its limits, there is a something more...we just don't know.

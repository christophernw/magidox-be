The movie industry is doing one of two things when their movies portray explosions in space:. . 1) assumes that the ignitor is an explosive that does not need oxygen to react, like liquid hydrogen fuel, or. . 2) the more likely one, people never put two and two together when it comes to lack of oxygen and volitiles that need it. . They also have a problem with putting the sound of explosions in space, which is not right because sound needs a medium to travel through to be heard.  They often times dumb things down or exaggerate to make things more fantastic, at the same time giving people the wrong information.

I heard that it meant something else. Someone told me because if you look at a cracker it has a lot of characteristics of a white person. It is flaky, little substance, full of air, and never can really stand alone but only goes good with somehting else where it then attempts to take over. I found that explanation offending even as a black woman. There was a lot more that they said. I just think that racial slurs should be left alone.

Your right it is unjustified but then when you look at every country playing in the world cup each country has something back home that is unjust, Homelessness, Poverty, Unemployment rate, bad health care, bad school system, high crime rates, low wages the list is endless.. . But the money that these footballers earn and the money being spent on the world cup is more important then paying firemen more money to do a dangerous job, or improving the health care system.. . What about pensioners.. . Yeah the world is a funny place and people have some strange ideas about priority's.

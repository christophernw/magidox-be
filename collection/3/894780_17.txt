I'm guessing that as with most churches, the Catholic church wants some way to encourage loyalty. This is just one way they do this.. . Personally, confessing my sins is part of the repenance process. Unless it's something HUGE, I only need to confess to God, and the person I hurt (If I steal something, I need to go back to the person I stole from, etc.). . Again, I am not Catholic, so this is all speculation.

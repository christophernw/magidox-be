I think your emphasis is really on the to smoke or not to smoke issue. I do not agree with placing restrictions on individuals per say buy unfortunately smoking is now regarded as a generally anti-social activity. The wishes of the many (non-smokers) now out-way the addiction of the few (smokers). We all know that smoking is bad for you.

When I was a teen ,I wanted to fit in and be cool.. Television ads were Rampant back then.The ads even implied it made you look sexy,relieved tension ,and tasted good.. Well it took 33 years to KICK the habit .I did hypnotism ,gums ,cold turkey and Nic o ban .The latter tasted awful. I finally asked my doctor and she gave me Zy-ban ,I made up my mind to quit.The last cigarette was on June 23rd 1998.I Will Not Go Back. I am PROUD of ME.

Its true.. . But changing your metabolism is not something I would know about.. . My metabolism is obscenely high, and I'm underweight as a result. I am practically incapable of putting on weight at all. I've joked on occasion that I could eat a camel and survive (something typically deemed to be impossible), provided it wasn't in the desert, on the basis that I'd have burnt up most of it as pure heat energy before I got to the end of it.. . Its not all fun and games though.. I tend to be freezing cold when I get up in the morning due to not having eaten for several hours. If I don't eat very regularly, my body temperature starts to drop and I lose energy rapidly. I've got no reserves to fall back on.. . So yeah... its true.. Not sure about speeding your metabolism up though.... unless you want to try drinking a lot of caffienated drinks.

Remove interior panel of sliding door.. carefully peel back plastic sheet of weather guard..(8mil plastic sheet)  Reach up inside door and find power lock mechanism and detach.. (just a clip).. Do the same for the rod that goes from the keylock to the manual lock button. Detach this in same way as above.. (at the door lock end)..  Using a mirror and light, if needed.. look inside the door at the back of the keylock.. there is a "fork-like" sheet metal clip. Remove this clip, just pull, and the keylock will basically fall off the front of the door....

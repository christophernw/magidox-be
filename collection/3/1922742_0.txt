Back in the olden days, when people had worked out that electricity existed, but weren't really sure what it was, they knew that either the positive charge was moving or the negative charge was moving, but didn't know which. They took a guess and picked positive, so elecrtical current is defined as the flow of the positive charge.. . A couple of hundred years later we discovered the electron and found that it was actually the negative charge that moved. It had been the convention for so long that no-one really wanted to change it as it would screw up everything that they already had, so now we just have to accept it that way.. . (That's why most electronic formulae have a - in front of them.)

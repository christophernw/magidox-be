Harry Truman has a plaque on his desk that said the buck stops here. In Bush's case it is the bucks come here. The president sets the policy and the congress agree's or disagrees with it. In this case we have a rubber stamp repuglican congress that has only had the gonads to stand up to Bush in a few instances. Like the ports deal. But not very often for a person so mistaken to think he is the decider.

when you open the jack..there will be a blue and blue white jumpers..and orange and orange white jumpers..connect these to the wire or existing jack..they should have the same color configs. dont strip the wires, they should just pinch in too the "buttons" that come with the jack..good luck. . sincerely ..a telephone man

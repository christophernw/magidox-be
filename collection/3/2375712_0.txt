The study itself is called proxemics.  Appropriate distances are largley determined by cultural expectations. Americans avoid touching much more than the French. There are typically four individual spaces that can vary withing a culture. Intimate, personal, social and public distances can vary independantly of each other.  You should always read as much as you can concerning a new cultures interaction expectations if you are going to travel for vacation or to join the culture. Seeminly small factors can determine how well you assimilate with the people of a culture.  Also, there is always an enormous room for personal differences which can override a cultures typical expectations.. . **Jon MC, I would like to hear further explanation as to why you think not only  that social sciences are flawed in general but also more specifically, what you mean to imply by saying it is evolved rather than cultural and when you say they may be wrong....to what standard or measure of correctness are you refering to....Thanks :)

It is in the mind, not anywhere else that masculinity starts. A masculine man is kind and loving and caring and faithful and respectful. He is also firm, strong, assertive, confident, self-controlled, disciplined, and confident-inspiring. He is not a bully nor abusive, aggressive, loud, and does not lose is temper easily. He certainly does not beat his wife, but keeps his chidren disciplined.. . These attributes come naturally to some and and some men have to build up the areas where they are weak. Attending short management and psychology courses in good schools really helps in this respect.. . If you notice, I have not said anything about the physique, the dressing, the money or those extrinsic things, because there are many men that have them, but are no men at all.. . Beware of people who preach those things as the hallmark of masculinity. They help, but the intrinsic, is the real man. The man inside. Work more on him more than the man outside.

Sperm leakage is a nartual occurance in a lot of men. Since I don't know what *kind* of sperm leakage you're specifically talking about lets address the two most common:. . Nocturnal emissions: A nocturnal emission, basically, is ejaculating in your sleep -which is common among teenagers and young adults, or any time after puberty. They are sometimes the result of erotic dreaming. But that's not always the case. One theory about why this happens is that your body is relieving itself of 'built up' sperm. Another holds that it is the result of very erotic dreams, or memories of waking sexual activity. Not every teenager or adult experiences this -although it is said that most males will experience a "wet dream" at least once in their post-pubescent lives. It is normal to experience.. . The other source is what I will call, the "pre-drip". This sometimes happens in guys while actively engaging in a sexual activity, more often than not, during foreplay. It is also known a "precum" -as some have dubbed it. Not unlike nocturnal emissions, it is the result of erotic excitement or in anticipation of sex, sexual acts, or anticipation of orgasm, penetration,  ejaculation or other psychosexual stimulus. It may also be a means for some males to produce lubricant before penetration. Not all men experience this "pre-drip". It is normal.. . In either scenario, "leakage" is perfectly normal and you really shouldn't worry about it. While it may seem somewhat embrassing (esp. if you're a teen and mom still cleans your sheets), it is not a sign that there is anything wrong with you.. . While you may be tempted to pursue voodoo-like "natural" remedies, there is no "cure" to speak of, except perhaps TIME. As you mature this will likely fade, if it doesn't, don't let that bother you. It's your body and you should be proud of its capabilities.. . Best of luck, man!

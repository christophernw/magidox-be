I'm sorry to hear that. If this is the first time your cat has been introduced to this brand of cat food, it could be due to that playing some role on her digestive system. But if you've always fed her this particular brand, I would lean toward a bacterial infection. There are countless species of bacteria that cause explosive diarrhea in humans, such as giardia. If your cat consumed fecal contaminated food or water, she could have taken in the cysts which lead to symptoms such as explosive diarrhea....If this were my cat, I'd phone a vet for an appointment, and in the meantime keep careful observations so you can accurately describe your cat's condition to the vet...I hope all goes well.

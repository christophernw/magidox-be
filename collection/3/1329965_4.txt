THAT what you just said IS the first sign,..plus being really paranoid about things and extremely high and uplifted about life then a downward spiral of lowness,....i have learned from counseling my inmates that "when your up your up, but when your down,..you crash"..one inmate i had once told me when he crashed after a weeklong binge on meth,..he slept for 4 days straight,..but thought it was the next afternoon,....this person needs help seriously and immediately!!

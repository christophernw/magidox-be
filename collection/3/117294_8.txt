Hold on here... Folks generally stamp the "Christian" label on me, and I don't call Atheists immoral.  Stubborn, maybe, but not immoral.  Often Atheists are among the most moral people I know.  Usually when someone decides to label themselves that way it is because of very strong moral convictions.  In fact, I will bet you that some 'Atheists' will be in Heaven WAY ahead of some self-proclaimed 'Christians' who really don't have a moral bone in their bodies.. . See, Salvation (eternal life with God) is not something we accomplish ourselves.  It is the gift of God through faith in Him.  And superstitious sniveling in the name of The Lord because you are skeered of going to Hell is not faith.  Often it takes more faith to take a stand and point out that something is rotten somewhere than just to blindly follow the piper off into oblivion.  Just don't trot off into the land of self-righteousness, because NONE of us have all the answers, everyone's poop stinks, and we all need a guiding hand now and again.  Atheism might be proof of someone's ability to think for themselves - but don't let pride stop that process.  Keep thinking and keep searching, there's good news just around the bend...

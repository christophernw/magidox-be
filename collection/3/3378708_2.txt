I think its because most women are ashamed of their  body , then theres the time factor that most arent willing to invest (even into their newborn baby) its easier if somebody else can feed the baby.. I breastfed all 3 of mine and reccommend it to any new mom .. its such a great bonding experience as well as being the most healthy thing for baby :) ~Melissa

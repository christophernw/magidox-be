You hit my area of expertise, having gone through 3 of them in my sort 26 years.  The swelling in your ankle is due to blood flow.  I'm assuming you got cut recently.  If not you need to talk to your doc.  Back  to the blood.  because of recent trauma to your leg, your blood vessles are a little swollen, along with a whole lotta bruising.  keep on icing and keep your head up.

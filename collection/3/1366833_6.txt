Ecclesiastes 5:10 . "Whoever loves money never has money enough; . whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with his . income. This too is meaningless.". . Luke 12:19-21. And I'll say to myself, "You have plenty of good . things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, . drink and be merry." "But God said to him, 'You . fool! This very night your life will be demanded from . you. Then who will get what you have prepared for . yourself?' "This is how it will be with anyone who . stores up things for himself but is not rich toward . God."

Almost never actually happens, it's like the word `tomorrow', it never comes.  Almost could be defined as off target, near, eventually, not quite there.  So the word `almost' seems to have no physical meaning on it's own, it requires joining to a sentence or as a statement before it gains substance.  Some other cultures have no comprehension for the word `almost', in their eyes thing either happen or they don't, it's there or it's not.  It's a word for an event that did not happen.

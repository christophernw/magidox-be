sunrise service at an outdoor chapel with my parents...I go to church with them like twice a year cause when I do it makes my mom so happy...it's kinda cool tho, they have a full brass section for the upbeat pieces and stuff...how on earth they play those instruments in the freezing cold is beyond me, seems as tho their fingers would be stiff & their lips stuck to the mouthpieces LOL

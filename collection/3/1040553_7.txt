That's really a philisophical question.  You could say "because everything had to come from somewhere," but that doesn't explain where God came from.. . Though the earth and the platypus are both evidence against evolution, so that could be seen as evidence for God.  The oldest desert on Earth is about 4,000 years old.  So is the oldest coral reef.  And the platypus is a significantly complex creature, though I won't go into all the reasons it probably didn't evolve to be this way right now.  Let's just say there are some pretty big flaws in the theory, which your science teach probably never told you.

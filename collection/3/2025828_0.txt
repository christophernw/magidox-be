I work on a horse farm, and there are plenty of un-majestic things that they do as well. Like when you are picking the stall, with a stallion in it, and you go to shovel the poo out from under where he is standing, and he gets a little "excited" and suddenly a three foot penis pops out, and nails you across the face, not the most magical moment I have ever had.

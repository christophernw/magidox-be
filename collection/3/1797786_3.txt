well, I know its hard, but its really really hard to get a true friend, when you are happy and your friends are happy around you, you don't know the value of your friend, but have some trouble and look for people to share and you will soon realise that your so called "true" friends were not so true after all. I am not saying that there are no true friends, but such true friends are very very rare and its a gift to have one and I am thankful to all my true friends. I know I have only a few.

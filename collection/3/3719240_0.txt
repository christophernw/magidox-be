well, the best way to see if your body's retaining water is to weigh everyday around the same time eg 9am in the morning. If you put on 1 kg in one day that's fluids and can be nothing else.. . Signs: getting more uncomfortable, appear "bloated", "bigger", swollen ankles, big tummy, might get short of breath, unable to lie flat at night, waking from sleep short of breath.... . depending on what the cause is..if its dodgy heart..try not to drink too much water a day (1-2 litre maybe) ...and fluid tablets might help..

Put the pot back on the burner but with some soapy water in it. The hot soap with brake down the carmel.. Use a chore-boy scouring pad on it, because they tend to scratch the least. Pour a little soft scrub on after that, let it sit for a while. With a little elbow greese, it should come off.. . Good Luck!. SmileyCat : )

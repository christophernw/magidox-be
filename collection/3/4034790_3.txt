Unfortunately, as we age, our metabolism slows down. It becomes harder to lose and sometimes even to maintain weight. Has your activity level changed? You may be able to still eat what you like but start walking for 20-30 min. 5 times a week. Otherwise, I am afraid a diet is your only option. Let's face it, nobody wants to see their belly hanging over their pants! . The issue of 45 pounds in 6 months is scary if your exercise and/or diet have not changed.  I would recommend you see your doctor to have your thyroid and other things checked out. Sometimes a medical condition can be the reason for excessive weight gain.

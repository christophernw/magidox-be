Use the "kriss-cross method".  Just kris-cross the subscripts of each element, and add the proper charge in front of the numbers.  Remember, FeCl3 is saying:  Fe1Cl3, so just switch and put on the top the 1 and the 3.  And then add the + or - charge sign.  Iron is always positive, as are all metals (except perhaps hydrides), and chlorine is always -1, as are all of the Group 7  (halogens) elements.

I use a 1 cup any flavor yogurt,  1 banana, sometimes a peach or strawberries. A little milk and some frozen yogurt if you have it. Put in 2-3 ice cubes, blend and serve! It's great and the whole family loves it! I have also used orange juice and pineapple juice instead of milk and that works great too. Enjoy!

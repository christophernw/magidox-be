You could take some Milk of Maganesia (sp?) to resolve it for now. In the future, drink more water and be sure to eat enough fiber...like whole grains, bran cereal, fruits & vegtables.  You could also take daily fiber supplements in pill form or as a powder you mix with water or juice & drink such as Metamucil or Citracel.

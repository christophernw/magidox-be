This is a common misconception about evolution.  It is not that we came from apes, but that apes and humans might have a common ancestor somewhere down the line.  The same goes with the Neandertals; they are obviously a different breed, but they're still human because they're close to our closest ancestors, and it's possible that there was crossbreeding.

It's amazing how much sounds can distract you. Even more disconcerting can be your own mind wandering and desiring to find something more interesting or fun to do, rather than work. I have found that investing in some good headphones (the kind that engulf your ears) and listening to some background music accomplishes two things: 1) It kills the outside noise. 2) It keeps your conscious mind busy enough to help you focus. Another less tangible strategy would be to decide on one thing you want to accomplish - something very small like maybe writing one paragraph of a term paper or simply just writing one page in your personal journal so that you can warm your mind up to work. It would be alot like warming your body up to exercise. If you have to run a marathon, you probably don't want to without warming up your body and getting your mind right to do it. Hope that helps.

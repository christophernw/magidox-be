It's really actually just propaganda used by people when they disagree with judicial decisions that declare laws passed by legislature to be unconstitutional.. . Mostly it's used by conservatives (who are very good at political propaganda) to characterize judges as "liberal" "activist" judges who "legislate" from the bench.. . But in reality, a great example of legislating from the bench is U.S. Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia.  He has single-handedly voted more than any other justice to overrule acts of legislation passed by Congress.  That's "legislating from the bench."

Actuallly, it does. The difference is the amount of force expended by each process. The rockets expend a force great enough to impel the shuttle. The shuttle has a rather significant mass. A=M/F. The force of the water is not great enough to move significantly the mass of the shuttle even if it is ejected at high velocity, though it would in fact move it a little. The rockets are fired periodically to correct the orbit of the shuttle.

Huh? Not only black people do that. I see white people do that quite often when I go to the movies. It's not about what color people are, there are rude and inconsiderate assholes in every race. Racist people will only notice what they want to notice though and they connect everything bad a person of another race does to their race, while when someone of their own race does it they're just individual assholes.. . Or do you mean to tell me you have never met a rude asshole of your own race?

The albatross (as in one around your neck) symbolism comes to us from the Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Coleridge.  It represents a burden one has to carry as penance for wrongdoing in the case of the story cited.  Metaphorically the albatross represents "a cross to carry", a burden or some task one must complete in order to be free.

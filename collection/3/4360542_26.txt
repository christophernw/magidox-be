LOOK,as far as killing is concerned everyone is doing it in one or the other way i:e emotional or physical. in our country(india) if muslims kill 10 ,hindus will kill 10000.so u see its all communalism blended with religionalism. BUT, AS FAR AS TERRIORIST ACTIVITIES ARE CONCERNED muslims dominate it. mainly because this is a backward community lacking money which are forced by some muslims fanatics to take up this job. but that doesn't really mean that the whole muslim community is like this. in wars muslims have proved their loyalty to infinity. our president is also a muslim and as far as kuran goes ,bible,gita, kuran have  taught the same meaning of love and peace. so its not kuran but some spoilt brains who for their own favour have spoilt the name of their community

triamcinolone is a steroid ointment that they use.  the also have shots that can relieve symptoms.  and the wet pj treatment works very very very well.  get his pjs wet and then put them in the dryer to get them warm in the meantime making him soak in the tub for 15 minutes with nothing in it.  don't wash his body or hair either.  then put on the lotion you have chosen to put on  try aquaphore or the perscription your doctor might give you and then put the pjs on him.  laying him down for bed and let him sleep.  this works because the moisture stays on the skin all night.  do this 3 or 4 nights for a week and the skin will look so much better.  eczema is a noncurable disease that is caused by a build up of skin cells because the cells reproduce more rapidly than others peoples skin. and since the skin cells reproduce quickly we do not have the natrual moisture other people have   i have had eczema for 15 years (all my life) and i amaze doctors with how bad i have it.  also don't use scented detergents try purex free and clear it has not scents or color so it doesn't irritate your skin and try to avoid using a lot of perfume around him.  check ya later â™¥

Not warning you about how to avoid hell-- that would be revenge. How is warning you to repent and be saved revenge...? You seem to be hung up on a basic assumption-- that there isn't any hell, and that Christians are ONLY trying to scare people. Well, there IS a hell! and we're trying to scare people, so they don't wind up there! . . We didn't invent hell. How will you feel if, in eternity, you find that you cut yourself off from the One Who is the Source of all good? Won't that be pretty bad, with no hope of ever getting better? . . If your house was on fire, wouldn't you want someone to break down the door and yell at you to get out while you still had the chance? Or would you ignore him and stay in there and burn and blame him for 'scaring' you...? This is not a manipulative threat but a sincere and caring warning.

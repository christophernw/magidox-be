I don't know what you mean exactly by "poverty line".  If you can give a bit more detail about what you mean I may be able to answer.. . There is no official poverty line in Canada, but several measures of low income published by the federal government are used by NGO's.  The websites I've attached should shed some light on the matter for you.

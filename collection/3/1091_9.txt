They are persecuted in all the world. Remember when christ told his deciples in JOHN that the world hated him before they hated us. Here in the US christians are being persecuted also not as bad as in other countries. Islam believes that if you do not believe the way they do they should cut off the head of the infidel. As a christian let them try. I walk in GODS light. Only he can determine my fate! Islam is not a peaceful religion! remember there is only one GOD.

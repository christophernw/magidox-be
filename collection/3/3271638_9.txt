I think it is true, GM quality is starting to drop.  I have a 2000 Chevy Express 1500 van I bought new and at 42,000 miles, they had to replace the transmission and fix the air conditioning.  Fortunately GM picked up the cost of the transmission, but I had to pay $450 to get the air conditioning fixed.  I really wander if any of the US car makers are making a true quality car anymore.

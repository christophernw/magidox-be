As a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist I would strongly recommend that you do your homework. This would include whether or not the person is certified, which they need to be. Also if they are, what is their certification or how they are certified through. Some top ones include NSCA, ACE, and ASCM. Also you need to see if they will be compatible with you. Another thing is the price range. This will depend on where you live. If a trainer is charging a small amount in an area that is usually expensive than that might signal a red flag. Good trainers will charge want they think is appropriate for their qualifications.  So, good luck in your quest.

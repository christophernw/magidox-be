In a tearoom in the City of London.  It became known as LLOYD'S..    Here is an example of Insurance and why it is needed.   You are organizing a function where the tickets are £10 each.   You need at least ten people to attend. Income expected £100.  If it were to rain, no-one is likely to attend.  You therefore take out INSURANCE against rain which will cost you for instance £20.   If it does rain and no one attends, the Insurance company pay you £100.   It guards against severe losses.   Most people insure their homes, businesses, property, equipment in case of fire, theft or damage.  When setting up the cost of an item, insurance costs are added in as a necessary expense.

I don't see how hospitalization is going to develop social skills.. Are you referring to an inpatient hospital for children with mental health issues who would be in a group setting interacting with other children with mental health issues? I would get a second opinion before putting your child in the hospital to develop social skills.  The larger issues, in my opinion, are the anorexia----very serious, and his refusing to go to school. Your child does need help. Why don't you get a 2nd opinion from a good psychiatrist or other mental health professional who is trained to work with children with mental health issues.

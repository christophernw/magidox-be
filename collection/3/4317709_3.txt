I asked a question like this about a week ago. I was worried that something was wrong with me because I couldnt have a vaginal orgasm only from clitoral stimulation. My question eventually got deleted but before it did I had learned from several woman and a website that most woman dont experience vaginal orgasms. There arnt very many nerves inside a woman's vagina. The main sexual organ is the clitoris. Usually woman fake it because they dont want the man to feel bad. If you want her to have an orgasm you need to constantly stimulate the clitoris during vaginal sex. Try having sex ''spooning'' she can bring her leg back exposing her clitoris and you can stimulate it with your fingers. You can also have her be on top and place a figure under her clitoris and while she is ''riding'' you she can stimulate her clitoris. I tried these things and it works! I hope I could help!

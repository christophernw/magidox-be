.  First of all, has this fetish ever caused a problem in your behavior toward others or in your relationship with your wife?  As long as your relationship with your wife is not damaged by this, and you have to inclination toward inappropriate behavior toward others, I would say that this fetish is not a problem, just an oddity in what you find stimulating.. .  If you want your son to not have this fetish, then I think that you and he should see the same psychiatrist.  It is apparent that he has this fetish, whether you want him to or not.  If there is any chance that this can be "cured' by being treated early, it is going to require professional help.  And, it would not seem fitting to ask that he seek treatment for it unless you also seek it.  If, with treatment, he loses, or lessens the fetish, and for whatever reason you do not, well, at least  he will see that you took the same medicine.

Freckles:. A predisposition to freckles is genetic and is related to the presence of the melanocortin-1 receptor MC1R gene variant. Freckling is caused by the same process that produces sun tanning, although the distribution of melanin is not the same. Light skin and (especially) red hair are associated with an increased likelihood of being able to develop freckles.. Freckles are predominantly found on the face, although they may appear on any skin exposed to the sun. Freckles are rare on infants, and common on children aged 5 to 15; they are less common on adults.. . . Wow that's why you can play connect the dot on my face..     :)

Yes, strep infects many areas of your body and hopefully you were put on antibiotics immediately. The initial symptoms are usually first seen and felt in the throat, but it can spread to other organs in your body long after the throat pain is gone if it is not treated. It can actually be quite dangerous, so I'm glad that you went to the doctor.

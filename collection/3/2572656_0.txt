Hitler committed suicide in the FÃ¼hrerbunker on 30 April 1945, in Berlin by means of a self-delivered shot to the head (it is likely he simultaneously bit into a cyanide ampoule). Hitler's body and that of Eva Braun, (his long-term mistress whom he had married the day before), were partially burned with petrol by Fuhrerbunker aides, and hastily buried shortly thereafter in the Chancellory garden with Russian shells pouring down from all directions, and with Russian infantry less than a few hundred meters away.

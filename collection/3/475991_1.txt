You should consider offering a pay as you go rate. Lots of people don't join a gym because we never get our money's worth. . If you offer a monthly membership scheme and a 5-10 quid pay as you go alternative, people like me would come when we could.. . Obviously there's the risk that some members would switch schemes. But there's no reason why, even the pay as you goers - don't have to pay an upfront joining fee too.

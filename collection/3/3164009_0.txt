Physical maturity is basically the aging of your body. When a kid becomes fully phisically matured then they're an adult, or they're finished with peuberty. Emotional maturity is the "aging of your mind" I don't think there's a limit to how mature you can get in that field. But as you grow more mature, you'll be wiser, smarter, and you'll have a more sophisticated sense of humor.

Sublingual means beneath the tongue. The sublingual route of administration of a drug provides an absorption route that bypasses the liver, hence avoiding the first pass effect due to metabolism of the drug by the liver before it reaches the systemic circulation. It also means that more of the drug is available for its effects as compared to the drug being given by the oral route.

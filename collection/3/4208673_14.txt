Term limits vary state by state.  The larger states do impose limits while small ones tend not to.. . There should be term limits all across the board.  Whatever happened to the noble idea of the "citizen legislator" made famous in movies like "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"  with Jimmy Stewart?. . Yeah there's elections.  But try removing an old politician who's been in his/her seat for ages.  They have money, power and  incumbency.

Many religions create a system of absolutes. My God is truth, or My ideals are just, or reconcilation only comes from this or that or so on. Religion is based on a system of moral codes and culture that a group has to agree on. Since there are so many different ways to approach a religion with the stories and teachings and on and on, it becomes easy to see why there are so many ways to get to religion. Still, it poses the question, are my absolutes right if everyone elses are. This is especially a problem if other religions promote things that seem contradictory to what you believe. Therefore many religions provide inclusion and exclusion standards to provide a sense of comfort to their believers - to make sure they are sure they have it right.

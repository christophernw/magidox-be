First off we are no longer currently "at War," we won the war when Bagdhad fell and then we captured Saddam.. . We are currently staying in Iraq as requested by their fledgling government as protection while they rebuild their military and police forces.   Currently 75% of the country is considered stable.  The insurgents are coming in from other Muslim countries to disrupt the formation of the new Democratic government - one which will disrupt the balance of sexist hierarchies in the Middle East.  To leave before the government has stablized would mean more bloodshed in future years.. ***********************. Edit: In the midst of an Oil shortage - how can some of you be dumb enough to say we're there for Oil.  Iraqi's not the US have control of their oil fields.

Measurement is describing attributes, skills, knowledge in numerical terms.. . Evaluation is making judgements based on the results of measurements.. . So, for example, teachers do measurement using classroom tests, and do evaluation by assigning grades.. . Psychologists measure intellectual skills through an IQ test, but make evaluations by assinging values to the range of measurement scores (i.e. average, below average).. . There is a level of Bloom's Taxonomy called evaluation. That is a different concept than the use of evaluation in a measurement sense.

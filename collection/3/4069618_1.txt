It is amazing how attractive people find others who are interested in THEM.. . if you'd like people to notice you in a good way, stop focusing on yourself and start actually noticing others.  This doens't work as a ploy, though, you have to actually be interested in other people - in their thoughts and opinions and interests and such.

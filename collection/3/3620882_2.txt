Probably both of the above answers combined -- but most importantly, the ability to make a sophisticated and accurate map of the entire world.  If you look at the shapes the continents make you'll see that they fit together almost like a jigsaw puzzle, so it became apparently to anyone who looked carefully that perhaps at one time far in the past, they were all one continent.. . Though in fact India broke off from one of the other continents and moved and is currently slamming into Asia -- thus, Himalayas.  :)

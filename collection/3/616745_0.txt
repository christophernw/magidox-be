I think that rich people are mean, and do not like to mingle wih us less-than-fancy people, because they can afford better things than us, quality things, and so we're not worthy...don't know if I'm making myself clear...okay, see how if you see a homeless in the street you wouldn't approach him and say hi, right? So the same thing, us who are not millionaires, are like homeless to them! They're afraid that we may infect them with something or steal their precious belongings!....that's my impression..

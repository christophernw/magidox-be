Tell them that you will be home at a reasonable time.  If you have a friend that they really like and think highly of, let them know that person is going with you...the buddy system.  . . If they do decide to let you go, make sure you come home when you say you are going to. Don't do anything foolish.. . Good luck, have fun!

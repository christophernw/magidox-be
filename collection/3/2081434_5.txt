could be that they REVIEWed THE EVIDENCE.. good and evil exist - we all can sense that.. that has us feeling that there is a judgement for our actions.. which points to a Judge (maybe the universe/whatever created us?)... that we can figure out without looking outside of ourselves - without looking at ANY evidence in the world.. then we realize we have a brain.. eyes.. and ears.. and a sense of touch - and as we realize that GOODNESS is the correct path, we understand that reaching for it is GOOD... so we look for more evidence.. -----------------------------. that said. I dont know everything - 'evidence' nowdays is basically 'because he/she said so'. personally... i'm reexamining ALOT of 'evidence' that this world has given me lately. i'm looking for Van Allen Belt information - not just what someone else has said, but how we origionally figured that they exist/how powerful they are. i'm looking at alot of 911 stuff - and a list of very bad things that the government has done in the past; cuba comes to mind... mkultra.. etc. . ----------------. that all just points to the need to look at evidence yourself - that what you're being told isn't always the truth.. ----------------. i, am NOT going to tell you what the truth is.. ----------------. but i will tell you that i've examined the evidence; i've started with the oldest, most valued & reliable religion (Judaism), and i've looked at it for validity as best i could - i'm still looking at it, and by no means am done - but looking at the prophecys... is interesting. they seem to tie in very well with 'Christianity'; the dead sea scrolls are most interesting... as is the early history of the church (dan brown is both an idiot, and an asshole - one shouldn't misconstrew the truth; not that people check into it anyway... but rewriting history i have MAJOR problems with).. --------------------. the basics of Judaism and Christianity is this 1) Love the Lord with all your heart, mind, and strength 2) Love your neighbor as yourself. and in Romans 2:14-15 it says . "(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.)" - . -------------. which to me, says that it doesn't matter if you know who/what Christ/God/Creator/whoever is. ---------------. - as long as you fulfill the law; which is 1) love God with all your heart/mind/str.. and 2) Love your neighbor. --- i'm still trying to figure out what GOD is in this context; but i'm leaning towards GOODNESS personified.. ----------------. and the wages of sin is death - SEEMS to me that it means that those who work; continuiously do something evil - sloth, lying, 10 commandments.. etc. - anything really against your concience - though your concience can be damaged; Good and Evil is written on your heart - but your concience is something else.. hitler & nazi youth come to mind. your concience can be damaged.. ------------------- anyway :D honorablepassion@yahoo.com drop me a note; i'm always looking for someone to talk to about things. just #1) be open minded and #2) dont be biased. ~test all things~

God as the Male principle of creation refers to the quality of stability/control, and the Female principle of creation as the diversity/changing aspect of nature. . . You could call it sexist I guess becasue it says Males are more stable than Females, but at the same time it is saying that the Female quality is more diverse and expressive than the Male. . . I'd say God in its true state is beyond male and female, just as it is beyond good and bad, but in terms of definitions, Male is the stable axis to which the Female principle of diversity rotates. . . Don't think too sexually about it.

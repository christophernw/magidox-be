It's so disrespectful to force your thoughts and beliefs on another, and many of the answers you've received clearly demonstrate the problem. Jesus was talking about something entirely different when discussing pearls and swine, and if you look at who he hung out with it was tax collectors and folks the pious people considered to be evil. Some of those "evil" people became leaders in the first church. . . I'd say that you have said something once to your friend already. Next you should take a neutral friend and discuss the issue. If that doesn't put an end to this, you should probably consider the person as not a friend who respects you as you are, and disassociate from them. . . BTW, the formula above for dealing with wrongs is Biblical if you want to share where this tactic came from with your friend, it's Matthew 18: 15-17. Besides this tactic being so highly recommended, it really does work.. . Hope things work out well, but it can certainly be a difficult situation.. . Best wishes,. ~Tia~

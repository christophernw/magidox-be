Microwaves are waves that are part of the electromagnetical spectrum.  The measured distance from tip to tip of the crest of the waves is what makes it considered a 'micro' wave.. . Microwaves are a shorter wavelength than the electromagnetic waves that carry radio signals, but longer than those waves that our eyes can detect in the 'visible' spectrum.. . NASA has a very good explanation of them at the Web site below:

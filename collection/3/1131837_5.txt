Hi,I feel exactly the same way has you.I feel like leaving everything behind which is not much.Like you I have become a loner & feel trapped.Last month my mam died,I felt like this before then.However the loss has made the feeling unbearable.. Maybe its with winter setting in they say the long dark nights can affect people.I hope you find the happiness your looking for.Goodluck

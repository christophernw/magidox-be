Yes it is a religion.. perhaps the problem is that so many religions that fall under the flag of Christian that disagree. Not all religions that claim to follow Christ believe in the basic doctrines of Christianity. there are so many divisions in Christianity that it wold be hard to lump it up as one religion but several different ones. There are several religions that do not believe in the Deity of Christ these are very separate from the mainstream of Christianity. IE The Ladder Day Saints and the Jehovah's Witnesses

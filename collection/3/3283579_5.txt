You are way off on this soryy. I'm not sure why they tried to get it banned but it was probably because most people aren't educated enough to know that it isn't fact. For example Opus Dei is real and yes they do allow the self mutilation, but most members don't use it. Second the Gnostic Gospels don't show that Jesus was married to Mary Magdelene. Those gospels were for one written over 100 years after Christs death and two when found they had hole in them.. . The Gospel of Phillip (the Gospel where the marriage thing came from) actually says "Jesus (hole) kissed her (Mary) on her (hole).. . Historians have shown that Christians often kissed each other as a greeting kind of like people do now in places like Britain.

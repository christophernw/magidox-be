If you want the Government to lower the prices an argument it that it will cause shortages.  No gas company will even try to produce gas for an area if they will get less than the market rate for it.  They will ship it over seas to get the higher price.  This will leave us with major shortages.. . If the gas prices stay high then gas companies from overseas will be encouraged to bring in more gas to get higher profits.. . When they move in for those profits they increase the supply and when the supply meets the demand the price goes down.  . . The market is its own best Control.

I am 100% American and I think America has many great things to offer. However, we are not the be all and end all of nations. I do not think it is our "supreme"duty to tell other countries how to run their politics. Do I agree with every decision that is made in America? Hell no! That is why it is great to live in America. WE are allowed to speak our mind and disagree with you and anyone else we choose. Do I want to leave? No way! Are things bad here? Yes, they are. Take off your rose colored glasses and look at what the real world is like. If you don't like people complaining about the situation our courty is in, leave, find new people to talk to, find someone who truly cares what you think!!!

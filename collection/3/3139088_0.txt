because certain signs are universally recognized. In the US and Mexico and many other countries, they have a stop sign octogon shaped, with white lettering in a red field because no matter what language you speak or read, you understand this sign to mean stop. Yellow signs, diamond shaped or squared are warning signs(yield, school zone, deaf children near), green are guide signs(street signs, freeway signs), and red with white colored ones are regulatory signs(stop, no parking, wrong way)

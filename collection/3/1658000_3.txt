Evangelism is one of the ministries of the five fold ministries of the church.  Evangelism is the "reaching" or "outreach" part of the church.  Anytime you go out and knock on doors, invite people to church, hand out tracts, or even witness about God, that is evangelizing.  It is spreading the good news about Christ.

If you feel the need to cut when stressed out, you may have something really wrong that needs some professional help.  . . Definitely some good answers in here.  Try some form of exercise, jogging, trail running or vigorous walking.  Yoga is another great option, to sort out the positives and negatives in your life and to regain some focus.  . . We all deal with stress in different ways, but don't ever resort to self-mutilation.  Another non-physical form of stress relief, is to laugh.  Try watching something like a funny movie, such an Anchorman.  Hilarious, *personal favorite.*

make sure he uses his right turn signal about 40 ft before passing the spot he wish to park in. also tell him to watch his rear view to see if the person understands that he is passing that spot to parallel into it. The reason they got him is because how was a car behind him to know he wanted that spot and to let the car that would be behind him know of his intention to park there.

The responsibility of preserving your own heritage lies with you.. There is nothing called culture in the west. so what ever they do cannot become a culture. One who can control his senses is cultured and one who cannot is uncultured. West there is no hard and fast rules advising control of senses. It is only in the east such advise is given Exhibition of destructive power is not culture.. India has survived the onslaught of many things and will continue to do so in future also.

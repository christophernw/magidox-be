Women are actually very valued by God and being shamefaced does not mean that you can't wear makeup or that you have to be passive. Deborah was a judge of Israel and she was married but she was chosen by God to be a leader, not her husband and the same holds true today. Look at Paula White (I think her husband is a minister too though, not really sure) and Joyce Meyers is a pastor, but her husband isn't. Also, the first witness to deliver the news to the disciples that Jesus had been ressurected was Mary Magdalene. So being shamefaced does not mean you have to be in the background or that you don't matter. . . Being shamefaced I Timothy 2:9 means that a woman shouldn't be extravagant in the way she dresses. The ending of that passage was the writer's personal take on women. Many of the things I've learned especially about the Bible has been taught to me by women.. . Also, to be human means that you were created in the image of God, which includes women. Women were not made in the image of the man all that means is that women were made in the same image as the man.

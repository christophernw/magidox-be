The masons - or Freemasons, which is the full name - isn't a religion, it's a ... society.  A group.  A group with spiritual and metaphysical beliefs in common, but there is no named supreme being, no specific beliefs you should adhere to in order to join - other than the belief in a "supreme being."  It has nothing at all to do with Judaism.

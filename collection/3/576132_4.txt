God is a jealous God and like most men is protective of His bride. The church of Christ is His bride and He is making her pure. Marriage in the Bible is a picture of Christ and His church so God takes seriously the purity of people in their relationships. In His kindness it also prevents many diseases from spreading and many children from not being abandoned.

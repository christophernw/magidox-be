Turn Signal may be a Burned out bulb, turn it on and look front and back. Sometimes the Good Bulb Lights just does not flash, so it the one not lighting. IF that not work you have to take them out and look.. The Auto Light. Make sure it turned on, most have a switch for Manuel and automatic. IF it not that check for a Blown Fuse. IF, it not that, the timer is bad and will need replaced. Probably in the light switch itself, I just not sure.

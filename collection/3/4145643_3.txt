Do you mean tricks?  To come when called and to obey?  Or potty training?. . . For potty training, I can't recommend KENNEL TRAINING enough.  I've listed how to go about it on my older answers, or get a book from the library..or check online.. . With obeying, it's rewards and firm commands.  The dog needs to know YOU are the alpha dog, not him/her.  Take charge, treat and dance around when they obey. Keep training sessions short, when they loose their interest after five minutes, take a break.. . If you mean tricks, it's actually the easiest.  If your dog say, dances when you hold a treat over his head, alway SAY the same thing.  "Dance!"  or "Act like Grandma!"  every single time they do it.  Then give the treat.  Pretty soon, when the dog hears "Act like Grandma" he jumps up on two hind feet.  The same thing can be done to get your dog to bark on commmand, turn off lights, etc.

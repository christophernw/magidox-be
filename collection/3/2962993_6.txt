No harm, if you don't mind smelling like smoke, coughing, learning how to inhale, getting used to it, getting to like it, getting addicted, throwing your money away, worse, giving it freely to gigantic corporations that know their product will kill you, and you pay them for the privelege. Oh yeah, you'll also age faster, damage your heart, get more wrinkles, die sooner, and have to stand out in the street 30 feet from any window, door, or vent if you want to smoke anywhere in Seattle. Sounds like fun, doesn't it?

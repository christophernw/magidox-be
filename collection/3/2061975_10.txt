Allowing air inside while putting it on can tear it, especially when the sex turns out to be wrethling match. And one of the two partners can use their sharp fingers and tear it when in the middle of the action, as no one recognises whether it is on or off, at the time of excitment! It is always advised to agree on use of condom. If your partner insists on "not" using it at first, then be careful all throughout the intercourse, cause he/she may play foul during the act.. . ENJOY SAFE SEX !

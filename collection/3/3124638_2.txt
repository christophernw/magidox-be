In order to protect Australians from illegal immigrants, all non-VISA holding personnels who enters Australia illegally will be sent and processed at Detention Centres around Australia. They can then lodge for asylum in Australia, and their cases will be heard by immigration. . . Whether you believe all that is up to you. Personally, I wouldn't trust anything that comes out of Amanda Vanstone.

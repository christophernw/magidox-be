Rather than talk about the "threat" of global warming, you should be talking about the reality of global warming. It's already here. Of the ten warmest years in recorded history, seven have occurred since 1990. The levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are now higher than at any time in the last 22 million years, and they're still climbing exponentially. . . Don't take my word for it. Take the word of hundreds of top scientists from around the world. The only people who deny the reality of global warming are the right-wingnuts of American politics.

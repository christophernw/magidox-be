Trying out for the Olympics? Lol. It isn't the length, its the depth that you need to focus on. But if you are running a marathon then pay attention to your diet. Oysters will give you extra staying power. And you need a lean diet of protein and no sugars. Eat this way the day before you think you might have a tryst. It will help you.

If you visit Sylvia Browne's website, she gives her predictions for the next 100 years. I love her and find her predictions logical and correct.. .    I am Wiccan, and personally, I don't believe the Goddess would destroy the earth anytime soon. What would be the point? We all have so much to learn spiritually before the earth is destroyed. I believe humans must learn to travel between this world and the astral plane consciously before we will use up Earth's potential..    However, I do believe we are experiencing something a little like Christianity's story of Noah's Ark. It is nature's way of balancing itself out again. Maybe a reminder to the world that we need to care for one another and live life the best we can because NOTHING IS PERMANENT, including our lives. Too many people live life as if they were immortal..   But...thats just MY point of view...

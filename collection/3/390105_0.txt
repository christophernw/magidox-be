hello, the first thing you need to do is get enough fiber in your diet from making you stop eating that much to begin with...fiber fills you up and you must get the good fiber, not just any fiber..good fiber are from fruits, veggies, whole grain breads etc..there is nothing wrong with having carbs, but you must have the good ones, not the bad ones, and we all know what the good ones are, just do a google search 'good carbohydrates' and they will list the foods that are good for you..cut out all the processed foods and meat if you have that at all.  drink alot of water and excercise cause excercise cuts out your craving for carbs and water fills you up temporarily just in case you dont want to eat for a while.  good luck and don't worry about the good carbs, just worry about the BAD ones! and be careful with protein, too much is not good for the liver, try FIBER, GOOD FIBER instead..

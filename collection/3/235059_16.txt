For a short time while I worked twelve hour shifts, I trained my dog to use a litter box.  Remember, the dog is still going to need regular walks and playtimes.  First, you need a bigger box than a cat would use - try the kind of  plastic storage box that fits under your bed.  (If your dog lifts his leg, you'll need an even bigger box, with one side cut out so he can get in.)  Then fill it 1/3 full with clumping cat litter - about forty to fifty pounds.. . It helps if when you walk the dog, you get him to go on command.  When you're ready to train him (like on a long weekend), go for an outside walk.  When he poops, pick it up and put it in your litter box so there will be a familiar smell.  You can do this with urine too, but collecting it is a lot messier!. At his next regular walk time, take him to the box and give him your "Go" command.  If he doesn't go after a few minutes, let him leave the box and either put him in a crate or keep him on a leash tied to your belt, so he doesn't have an accident somewhere else.  Keep trying this every few hours - eventually he'll go in the box.  Give him lots of praise.  Count on at least a week, before he'll reliably use the box on his own.  If you have to go out or go to work, confine him in the room with the box - preferably one with an easily cleaned floor.  Put an old rug on the floor where he jumps out - my dog tracked the litter everywhere.  He is not likely to eat his own poop from the box if you clean it out everytime.  However if he eats any of the litter, stop using it immediately - clumping litter can cause a serious bowel obstruction.

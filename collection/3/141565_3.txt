I was looking this up & found that someone called Siobhan had answered this already in response to another question from someone about calico cats.. . She said:. In England and parts of the United States, male calico cats are considered to be even luckier than normal calicos due to their extreme rarity. These cats are often called money cats, due to the popular, though mistaken, belief that they are worth a lot of money.. . This rumor probably started when a research establishment put out a call for male calicos to test them for fertility. In fact, because the vast majority of male calicos are infertile, they are no good for breeding programs and therefore, not worth a great deal of money. Amazingly, male calicos are said to have been advertised for sale at more than $10,000. That does not mean that anyone paid that price though. . . . http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061024113456AA5xRON. . but she may have got her information from this site:. http://www.best-cat-art.com/calico-cats.html

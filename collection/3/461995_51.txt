Geez, Rev first of all LENGTH is the correct spelling.  How boring can you get, the average attention span of an adult is 15 minutes, 20 tops without some sort of a break.  If you are preaching for 90 minutes you lost your congregation a long time ago and any point that you were trying to get across has been lost.  I am not sure that I can even recall any section of the bible that stated that Jesus had sermons lasting that long even the sermon on the mount.  I think that you may be possessed by the devil and are really trying to turn your parishoners away from God and his teachings and if this is true you are doing a good job for you already have them complaining, and keep it up and you will have them leaving.  Lighten up, make your point, hit them quick with the facts, let them absorb what you have to say and stop, they will love you for it.  You don't have to go on and on (what I am doing with this dissertation), you can get your point across quickly and effectively, so next Sunday try to shorten your sermon and watch the attention span take hold, watch your congregation come back into the fold and of course watch your collection plate get fuller and fuller for we all know that is the point of your sermons.

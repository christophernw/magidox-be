Because the govenment has superceded our rights as parents. We can't discipline our kids without the fear of getting arrested for child abuse. Now I'm not talking about beating teh crap out of kids but a good spanking DOES work. Americans who think it's horrible to spank your kids remember that when they turn on you and hit you.(Mine have never hit me and I don't expect they would dare but I know people who has been hit by their children and all they do is cry and wonder why. I'll tell you why, because you never taught them to be scared of consequences!) They don't listen because parents are depending on the law to raise their kids, listen to a police scanner and you will hear in one nights time the overwhelming amount of calls from parents who want the police to come over and settle down their 12 year old who is tearing up the house because the parents refuse to let the kids friends stay the night or some other stupid thing.. If parents would be parents and take control of the home life and and not let the kids dictate what life should be like then the kids of America would start obeying their parents again, like in the olden days.

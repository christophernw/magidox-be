I got this from the FAQ on http://www.goveg.com. . “But God made animals for us to eat—don’t we have ‘dominion’ over them?”. “Dominion” doesn’t mean “domination and exploitation.” All the world’s prominent religions teach the importance of both compassion and mercy. The choice to eat meat, dairy products, and eggs is a violent one—it supports abuse. Even if religious beliefs allow people to eat these products, they certainly don’t require them to do so. Aside from the environmental and human consequences of eating animals, which are reason enough for faith-based people to adopt a vegan diet, God created animals with needs, desires, and species-specific behaviors, and all these things are denied the animals who are turned into food by the farmed-animal industries. God also created animals with a well-developed capacity for pain, which causes extreme suffering in a factory-farm setting. Learn more at JesusVeg.com. This link provides additional Web sites that address animal issues from non-Christian perspectives.. . . I suggest you visit the http://www.jesusveg.com site...it goes more into depth about why some christians choose to live ethically.... . . My own personal opinion on the matter is that you are more disregarding his creation by eating meat...You should consider life to be precious, no matter whose it is...It's very arrogant for one to think that they have the right to take a life to satisfy their own pallate.

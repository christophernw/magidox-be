The oil companies are all full of crap! Their prices are excessive and they have no excuse to charge $2.59 a gallon for a product that is refined 10 minutes away - in Richmond, California. We are paying inflated amounts in Marin County (San Rafael, CA) and cities in the central valley where the oil companies have to transport the fuel long distance - the overall price per gallon is substantially cheaper.. . I have no loyalty to any one brand. I buy where it is cheap and make a point to stick with independent stations rather than the screwed up big oil companies.

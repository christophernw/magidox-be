The main characteristic of electromagnetic radiation is its frequency.. . It is very difficult to trace the waves of frequency less than 100kc/s.. . Practically the radio band begins with 150 kc/s and gamma rays of frequency  10^ 21 kc/s are traced.. . The nature of any E.M radiation is determined as follows.. . The radiation is resolved into its constituent frequencies.. . THIS RESOLUTION OF FREQUENCIES IS KNOWN AS SPECTRUM.. . In the case of light, ultraviolet rays and infrared radiation this is done by refraction through a prism or by passing the radiation through a grating.. . In the case of X-rays and gamma rays, resolution into spectrum is obtained by reflection by a crystal.. . The spectrum of radio waves is determined by making use of the phenomenon of resonance.

We had all sorts of cushioning ideas.  We also had a few where the participant would place an egg uncushioned in a metal pail.. . The most important factor is cushioning the fall.  I would use soft batting or wood shreds (like you see at bath shops) around the egg to sufficiently cushion it, and place it in a box or other container where it won't rattle around at all.

I've been a tropical fish hobbyist for 25 years and a saltwater hobbyist for 15.  If you purchase your fish from a good pet store quarantine is not always necessary.  Of course if you have a great collection of fish and are introducing a new one it will give you a piece of mind.. . Easy quarantine practice.. A small tank that is easy to set up. 2.5-5 gallons is good for smaller fish.  You'll need a heater, air pump and a small sponge filter or aerator stone.  Use water from your established tank.  It contains good bacteria that help break down waste, a small plastic plant from your tank weight down is great.  Has bacteria on it and gives some hiding effect.  In quarantine your watching for disease.  You do not need to treat unless a problem arises.  Some NON iodized salt, 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon per gallon is like giving them an aspirin. Again only if needed. After 5-10 days if the fish looks healthy introduce it to your tank.  Painting black on the bottom and back is common, make sure its on the outside of the tank.  It gives the fish more security by making them think they are in the darkness of where they would be in the streams in the wild.

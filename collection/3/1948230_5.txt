I had a little trouble to at first but the thing to do is that you're alonne in this fight so you have the carpet and the ability to fly.  Doge the buildings he throws at you and head towards his abs.  Smack them, and he'll be stunned then use the reaction command to spin him with his tail.  Use physical attacks on him and after losing enough energy he'll use an attack of electricity that will stun you.  It doesn't last too long but it makes you unable to move, leaving Jafar able to attack you.  Just keep in mind:. . -dodge buildings. -Defeat abs. -strike head and arms with physcial attacks. -reaction command. -repeat until defeated

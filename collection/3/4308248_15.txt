That was a tree of life. They had also a free will in the garden of Eden. They had a plenty of fruit to eat, everything was provided to them. Eve listened the serpent, and to Eve the serpent was dazzling. Serpent told her that she does not have to listen no God. She did not obey God, and she asked Adam to take an apple from that forbidden tree. . . So, you call God tyrant??What a nerve...Serpent is talking even today!! What about going to God and ask for His wisdom? And ask Him to help you to understand? Do not be like Eve...you know that story!

writting/ using ideas that aren't yours or orginal.  if you are writting a papper any thing you read in another, book, magzine or saw on the internet has to be citied in the text and in your bibliography.  You need to let the teacher/proffessor know that it is not an orginal thought you had.  If you have questions finish your paper early and if you are in college most schools have a writting lab if not take it to anther teacher or have a parent read it over

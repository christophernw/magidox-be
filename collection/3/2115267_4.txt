Besides covering the box or hiding it like others suggested, you can also set up an ambush.  Sometime when the dogs aren't looking go into the box and spray some Bitter Apple on the "Catbox Cookies".  Bitter Apple is a spray that you can buy at most pet stores.  It tastes aweful (Trust me!) and it will teach the dogs that eating the poo is not at all yummy.  If in a bind some Tobasco sauce will work, but its kind of strong, so I'd try the Bitter Apple first.  Good luck!

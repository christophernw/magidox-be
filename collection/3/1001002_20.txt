Wow, that was a stereotype.  I'm white, and I'm from the south, so would you accuse me of also being in the KKK?  . When will we ever get past the color of skin, and just see people?  I don't hate anyone, I don't like the lack of character and morals shown by some people, regardless of their skin color.

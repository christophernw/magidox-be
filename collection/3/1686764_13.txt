Religion is creationism, which makes more sense... while evolution is a theory from a guy who found similarities between apes and men! There are similarities between donkies and horses too! It could be OK for evolution if there are no more apes and we find only their bones like dinasors so it would mean that they were weak and extincted and men are the evoluted form... but we still see apes, and we don't see apes turning into men.....  I believe it makes more sense that God created man and taught him everything, while it's hard to believe that the world with its perfection is created by "chance"!

The key word here is "adults."  As people mature, they have a basic human need to be autonomous, to make their own decisions, and to learn from their own mistakes.  Children need to eventually grow separate from their parents and become independent thinkers to be happy and healthy. Frankly, your question sounds very patronizing and controlling to me.  If you are getting the same response from your kids, you need to lighten up.  Maybe it is time for you to find some new focuses for your energy, new friends, new hobbies, new community work, instead of trying to keep controlling your adult children to such an extreme.

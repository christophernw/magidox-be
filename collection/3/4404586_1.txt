>>>>How can Humanbeing be soughted out into different Races. . In an infinite number of ways. Every society and culture has had its won racial classification. . . What is telling is that no two of them were the same. . . Greeks believed they were the same Race as Egyptians, including Nubians from the Upper Nile, but a different race from Persians. Modern White Americans generally believe they are the same race as Greeks and Iranians (Perisans) but a different race from Nubians. . . Most modern Malays believe they are the same ‘brown’ race as Indians  and Negritos and but not the same race as Europeans. Most Europeans believe they share the same Caucasian race as Indians but are racially distinct from Malays.. . And the list of examples goes on and on.. .

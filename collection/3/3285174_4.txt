If you have a drug in your system, the current drug tests will find it. None of the products you can buy will help. As a matter of fact, the chemicals in these products are tested for themselves, and are flags for a more comprehensive look at you and your "pharmaceutical" usage. They can also take a sample of your hair and find anything that you have been using. Hair grows at a fairly consistent rate, so they can even get a reasonably close approximation of when you ingested the drug. The tests are so sensitive that diluting your urine will just make you uncomfortable. I administer all of the pre-hiring and post incident clearances for a large public safety entity, and experience has shown me that if it's there, we will probably find it.

The cross product of any two vectors that point in the same (or opposite) direction will be zero. The formula for the magnitude of the cross product has a sin(theta) term in it, where theta is the angle between the two vectors. So if theta is 0 (ie two vectors point in the same direction) or 180 (two vectors point in opposite directions), the magnitude of the cross product will be zero.

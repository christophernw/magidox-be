As said earlier it depends on the application. Many times it is nescessary to tighten screws only after all have been installed. This makes assembly easier when you have multiple holes which must line up. Many times it is nescessary move in a cris-cross fashion so that the piece being assembled is not warped during the tightening process. An example would be the cylinder head of an engine.

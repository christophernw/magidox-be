Leases of property vary from state to stae, but that doesn't mean that you are tied into one completely.. As laws vary, so do the leases, and with that being said, you need to examine the lease you signed to see if both parties have kept their end of the bargain.. A lease, is a legal document, comitting you to a specific term of rent. Your landlord has "banked" on the fact that you will be there for a said period of time, and with you backing out, that puts his finances in a mixed state. However, depending where you live, that may not all be that bad. Perhaps, you or your landlord can sub-lease the property for a higher "IF" vacancy rates in your area are at a low point.. As for the only "legal" way of getting out of a lease, then you must agree to pay the remaining time on the property.. Barring that, you may need to resort to being "evicted" perhaps by throwing loud parties and having the neighbours complain.

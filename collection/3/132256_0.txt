As Jon Stewart observed, calling Hardball or Crossfire 'political debate' is like calling wrestling 'athletic competiticion'. . . To kind of address your question, some people just like to be nasty little $hits and the media has taught them that this is OK so long as you do it under a pretence of political debate. Other people take it personally because it affects them personally; when you are trying to raise a family by working 60 hours a week for $5.15 an hour and someone tells you deserve to be poor and miserable because you "made bad choices" as a teenager -- it's kind of hard to NOT take it personally.

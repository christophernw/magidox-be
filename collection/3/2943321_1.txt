they are! that is the reason that there has to be a high sperm count in order for fertilization to occur...the sperm bombard the egg, until one makes it through to fertilize.  The egg then creates a protective wall to keep any more sperm out, but sometime two sperm will get in at the same time, hence identical twins.

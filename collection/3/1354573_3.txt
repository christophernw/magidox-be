It may be as simple as getting a humidifier for your living area, bedroom, etc.. Also, when bleeding, DO NOT look up at the ceiling.. Ice on the neck, yes.. Pinch nose closed, yes.. Look at the FLOOR.. Blood trickling down your throat pools into your stomach.. Stomachs don't like blood. Vomiting isn't cool.

First of all, I feel your pain. I feel unappreciated in my job. Here is what happened today. It is the last day of school and when I walk into the teacher's lounge I notice someone has placed little bags of candy that say 'good job' in everyone's box; everyone that is but mine. Even the office assistants boxes are filled. It is strange and I feel like I am an unknown here sometimes. The only thing that really helps me get through these tough times is letting it all go. I know what I do is important and just because someone may be unaware of my sincere efforts it doesn't really mean anything. Every day when I wake up it takes effort, and I realize the painful things in life are there so I can be aware of a bigger picture; a different picture. Of all the things that this event can remind me of, the most important is understanding that we all don't see this world in the same way. If for somereason I am not doing my job well, then I expect to be relieved of my duties. But until that happens I can only assume that if I am doing the best I can then that is all that matters. It doesn't matter what other people may think about me, and truthfully no matter how much I may care about being liked and accepted it will only get in the way of me doing my job. I am not here to be liked or to make friends, it is only an added bonus. The reason I am here is because I enjoy this experience of learning how to accomplish what is set in front of me in my occupation. Maybe I could even go as far as to say that is the reason I am here in this life, but that would fall under another subject line. Also I work so that I may survive another day, and when my degree of survival is at stake because of an unsettled feeling I know I have to step in and consciously let that feeling go away. When you believe that you do exceptional work because you are sincere in what you do then it will never matter what they may say because you know what to do, you know how to live day to day.

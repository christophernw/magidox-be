A "pyrrhic victory" is any victory that comes with a cost (in lives and material) so excessive as to make the victory meaningless, or is simply ruinous to the victor.. . Comes from the King Pyrrhus of Epirus, who resisted Roman conquest of his lands but at the cost of nearly his entire army and a generation or two of young men.  He eventually succombed during the Pyrrhic War, as Roman soldiers were easily replaced when wiped out, but he could not sustain the recruits necessary to replace his own high losses despite several early victories.

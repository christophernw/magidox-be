Oversee the finances of the Church.  Their job is probably to make sure the church is in proper running order and that the bills are being paid and that monies are going in the approprate places.  A church should always have an open book policy and member ship in the Evangelical Association for Financial Accoutability.  Also GAAP accounting principles.  I think If there is a serous problem the elders should be called to discuss and pray over a matter.  God should make the final decision.

How can Christians not believe in evolution? . . . idiocy.  idiocy and brainwashing.. . they can ignore evolution all they want.  it'll still happen, and always will happen.  false cult belief won't change that.. . and yeah, all you terrified, ignorant christians can give me all the "thumbs down" that you want -- it won't change anything either.

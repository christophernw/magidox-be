Interpersonal skills are not important they are essential to everyday living.  They are developed by using your intuition and caring how your messages (verbal or body language) comes across to others.  Look at what annoys you about other people and try not to do it, look at situation when what you meant has been misinterpreted and learn from it.  You will become a better person and a more powerful person.  Good leaders have "charisma" may be that it just another word for interpersonal skills, they are not misinterpreted and people want to follow them.

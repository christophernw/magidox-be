I'm a Christian, and believe that they only way to heaven is by accepting Jesus as your savior.  Where does that leave the rest of the people?  Hell?  It seems that way, if you study the Christian Bible, but only God knows for sure.  It all goes back to Jesus....I'm not sure on what Mormons actually believe, but if you don't have Jesus, well.... I wouldn't want to be you.....especially when you die.  As far as the "cult" theory goes, I don't know.

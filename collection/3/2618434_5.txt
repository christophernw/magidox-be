I would say that maybe it might be the valve cover gasket leaking oil where the spark plugs are at. Remove your plug wires to see if saturated with oil. Also you may have an internal oil leak. The best way to see for sure is to let your vehicle idle at about 2500 rpms at idle in a well ventilated area for 15 minutes ( by this I mean outside of your garage dont want you to get carbonmonoxide poisoning). After turn it off and let sit for 15 minutes. After that time go and start your vehicle up and just for kicks hit the accelerator a couple of times. If you have blue smoke  coming out the tail pipe then you do have an internal oil leak in your motor.

This is a sad & terrible health problem for many, not at all a question to be laughed at or taken lightly for it is a life & death situation for many. Most of them are young girls. More then a weight issue it is about self-image & the lack of self confidence. I am sure these girls have suffered from emotional abuse as children. Maybe at home or at school. They need the help of professionals & the sooner the better. So many are children wanting to be adults but it is their young bodies that will suffer the most from health issues. It takes so much for a young body to mature. I weep for them.

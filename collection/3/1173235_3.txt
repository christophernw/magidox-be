why do people insist on correlating the Bible with imaginary creatures.. . There are dead sea scrolls, archaeological finds that substantiate the Bible as "possibly being true".. . I believe it to be the truth because of my faith, but you cannot compare apples and oranges.. . Some scientific evidence is said to be fact with less evidence.. . He loves you why do you insist he does not exist?. God Bless

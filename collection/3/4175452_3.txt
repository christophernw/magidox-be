There is a enormous difference between the two.  The Civil Rights Movement is for the rights of Black people who were dehumanized and enslaved by the rich land owners for monetary gains. . The gay rights movement is only a plight for individuals who wish to come out of the closet and practice same sex rituals which is an abomination against God.  Please don't confuse these two different issues. They could never be similar in anything. Nor is the fight for equality the same, as Black people are still considered 2nd class citizens.   So, if you are Black and gay you are a 3rd class,  mis-directed soul seeking equality that should not exist.

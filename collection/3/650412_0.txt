You actually need to ice it down to relieve the swelling and pressure. Also elevate it as much as possible. You want to keep the blood away from that area so the swelling will reduce faster. Stay off of it for at least a week, if you can help it, to let the ligaments heal if they've torn. It usually takes 2-4 weeks to completely heal depending on how severe the sprain.

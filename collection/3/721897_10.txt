PLEASE DON'T DECLAW. it is painful for them no matter what anyone else's opinion may be. some vets will even refuse to do it because they know it's horrible for the cats. some good, humane, solutions are Softpaws - caps put on the ends of your cat's claws which will prevent them from scratching up anything, Stickypaws - a sticky sticker-like thing you put on your sofa to train them not to scratch it, and as always, giving them something good to scratch, like a scratching post, is a wonderful solution.

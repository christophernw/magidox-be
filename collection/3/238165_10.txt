My cat would do the same thing. I keep the lid closed because that's kind of disgusting. However, she will also drink out of the tub and sink. My tub has a leak. It drips just a little, which is her favorite place to get water. Maybe if you don't want her drinking out of the toilet, try the tub. Cats don't tend to like standing water. They also make water fountain like water dishes, which they like. Although if you have a cat that likes water, they will play in it and make a mess, just a warning from experience.

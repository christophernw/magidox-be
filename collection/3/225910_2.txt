You are probably not 'unlucky' but your expectations don't line up with reality.  You expect more winning or rewards than the world really gives.  You need to study statistics so you can see how few people actually can win things and figure honestly what your odds are so you don't get your hopes up.  You need to also take up yoga to hellp yourself be more realistic about the world.

If you are refering to situations that we get ourselves into over and over again, I think that it's due to our not having real people in our lives that we trust to tell us the truth.  We need others sometimes to help us see the things that we constantly repeat. The only way we will change is to have that person to put the mirror up in our faces so that we can really see what's going on.

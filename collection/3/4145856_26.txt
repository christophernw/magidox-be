Part of the problem is that the majority of those coming in illegally are from Mexico (1/6 of their entire population is here right now).  While we have several nationalities that become citizens each year most of the other nationalities come here legally following the correct process to come here.. . We need people to respect our laws and they will be welcome here with open arms.  If you think our laws are to strict look at Mexico's and tell me there is not a double standard.

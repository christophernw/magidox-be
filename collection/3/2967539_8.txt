This is more of a linguistic question than a math question.  In Arabic for instance the name of 11 is derived from the name for 1 and the name for 10.  In English the name elevin is derived from a Hebrew word Levi originally meaning "match" (I don't know to what extent this may be contested as far as translation goes).  The "match" refers to the duplication of the digit, it is the first number which has a duplicated digit, thus matching.  The name Levi originate from Leigha naming her son just prior to 2,000 BC.  There are actually many Anglo Saxon words borrowed from Hebrew still in English, but that opinion is very controversial these days.

Because, if failure was an option, we wouldnt make the effort. Whether it is school work or business projects, there is a goal for each individual, and we make the effort to reach it. It would be a waste of time doing anything in life if our attitude was that failure is acceptable. . . Dont misunderstand, failure is ok, once we tried. We did our best !!? I think!!

The universe is 14 billions years old, 83 billion light-years across, and 11 dimensions deep (see string theory). And that's just the part we can observe! It is also remarkably fine-tuned to allow for the evolution of life. To think that, with our limited perceptions, we could possibly grasp the nature and motivations of the force that caused the universe to exist is hubris in the extreme.

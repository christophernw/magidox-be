got your facts straight. Jesus died for THE WORLD's sin. that includes you and me...and everyone else. Jesus knows that we are human and we make mistakes. why would Jesus choose to save only a few people when he put so many on this Earth. We have a loving, forgiving God and he wants everyone to go to heaven. that is why Jesus was crucified, to save us all... even the nonbelievers.

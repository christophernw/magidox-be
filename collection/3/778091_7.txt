Filtered water is water that passes through a filter.. Distilled water is water that is evaporated and condensed again.. Both are designed to remove impurities in water. Distillation is generally more effective than filtration in removing biological agents and insoluble matter but it can also concentrate toxins.. Best to do both if you are really unsure about what could be in the tap.

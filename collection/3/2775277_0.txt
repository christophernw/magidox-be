You don't give much in the way of details, but my mother has Celiac Sprue, which is an intestinal disorder where her body can not absorb or process gluten, a protein in wheat and some other grains.  So she has to follow a very strict diet and purchase items marked "gluten free" at health food stores.  When she was diagnosed, they actually had to biopsy her intestine, but now they can do a blood test to diagnose it.. . Of course, there are a number of other potential causes, and you're better off seeing a doctor or gastroenterology specialist.

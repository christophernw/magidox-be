This isn't a philosophy question, it's a matter of science. The moon does not have an atmosphere capable of sustaining human life. If you look very carefully at the way the earth was formed and developed you will see that it is the result of an incredibly miniscule random chance and therefore its environment and atmosphere is very unlikely to exist naturally elsewhere.

A non-denominational church could believe or teach a wide variety of things. A denomination is a governing force of rules and basic beliefs that the church as to agree to and teach in order to join. So if it is non-denominational they normally have free-range to teach whatever. Sometimes this freedom is a good thing, and sometimes it is too much freedom and things can get weird. So it just depends on the individual leadership (pastors, elders, etc.) to govern themselves, so it is different from church to church.. . From what I understand the main difference between non-denominational and catholic is more of a catholic vs protestant situation.. . You both believe in the bible, and in jesus and all of that. Same core beliefs. But here are some subtle differences:. . They won't pray to Mary or any Saints. Prayer is just between them and God / Jesus.. . To ask for forgiveness is also private, there is no confessions or anything like that.. . Communion is more rare, and is looked upon as just symbolic, and its just bread and some drink and not literally body and blood.. . But the main difference is the concept of being "saved" by faith and not deeds or by baptism. So someone being Christian is based on their personal choice, and not by being baptised by the church, or being "born catholic" or whatever.. . Hope this helps some.

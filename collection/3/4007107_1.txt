That's a good question. To overcome religious differences is to most likely learn and respect others faith. Even if you don't personally agree with their ideologies, respect the person rather then discriminate against their religion.  Unfortunately, there are some whom are fanatics and must constantly impose their religion on others. They have a need to convert or out of superiority need to diminish others faiths. Ignore them as they are the trouble makers. Follow the above, and you will live in harmony.

Two different ways:. . 1) by giving a manipulative person a chance to "read" someone and push their buttons / pull their strings. 2) by giving an open person a chance to see what's moving them, what's in play, what's going on.. . What makes us think whatever we're thinking? Sure, we'd have thoughts even if /nothing/ was happening ... memories, questions, worries, all of that. But normally we're in an active environment, yes?. . So when we take control of what we're responding to we can have a strong effect on what we think. Colours, shapes, all of that. Pictures have a strong effect on us because they combine all of that.. . So, using shapes and colours and including symbols (which bring up whole groups of associations) we can have a strong effect on what "comes to mind".. . By giving meaning to different card positions (past and future; what you hope for and what you fear) we can construct a story.. . What I like to notice is what the person really agrees with or disagrees with in the reading ... those are the items that mean the most. Or this: sometimes someone will be almost blind to something ... that's meaningful too!. . But don't worry about this sorta thing ... they're just ways to get us to think a bit!. :-)

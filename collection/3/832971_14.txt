Originally, this medication was produced for treatment of Hypertension (High Blood Pressure), Brand name "Cialis". What it does is it dilates peripheral blood vessels so that there is no resistance to blood flow. As the FDA approved the drug and started using this, male patients started reported to their docs that they are so happy with the pill because not only it helped to lower their blood pressure, but also it helped with erection. Isn't it a magic pill? :) Shortly, after this accidental discovery, the pharm. companies reinvented the blue pill, changed the name to Viagra, and the price jumped from $5 for 10 pills  to $50 for 2 pills. How it works? Very simple. Erection is produced by feeling of cavernous sinuses of the penis with blood (no bones in the penis guys!). Blood flow to the penis is caused by dilation of the blood vessels. Penile sinuses are modified blood vessels embedded into the penile tissue. So, if the drug dilates peripheral blood vessels (and the penis is a peripheral organ), then it also dilates the blood vessels of the penis. The time of the drug's action is long because the inventors wanted the drug to work as long as possible, so that people with Hypertension wouldn't have to take a pill a few times a day (one time a day administration is convenient for a patient).

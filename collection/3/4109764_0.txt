You can apply to do an internship at a hospital that has that type of program.  Once you complete your internship you can sit for the exam.  Or....sometimes, I think, they will let you just take the exam without the internship, but I'm not sure about that part.  You can look at the American Society of Clinical Pathologists website for more information.

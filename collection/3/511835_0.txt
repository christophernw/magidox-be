In short, because they became too comfortable and lazy.  Let their guard down just like we are doing here in the U.S. and let their society rot from inside out.  A good example is that during the rise of the empire Rome was always increasing areas money, wealth, importation of all sorts of animals, goods, and other oddities. This all kept the population moving ahead.   Most folks don't realize that while the Roman empire lasted a very long time, it was only in the "late days" that the gladiators appeared.  This was a symptom of the decay of their society because by that time they felt that they had "done it all and seen it all" and had to "invent" more gore, violence, and such to entertain themselves.  Sort of a "Jerry Springer Show" for the Romans!  hahaha    Some very important correlation between the end times for the Romans, and what we as Americans are doing today with economy, education, trade, immigration, and politics.  The more you read on this the more it will make sense.   A saw a comment posted that "all civilizations eventually fall" and they are truly right .  Our's is not immune to this and is on the decline already.  My favorite quote on History is the one that says, "People who fail to learn from History are Doomed to Repeat It". No truer words were ever spoken.  :-)

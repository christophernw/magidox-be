Depends on what meaning you want to have behind it, I have girlfriends, but they are my friends that are girls, because I am a girl, I consider them my "pals", and I have guyfriends.. not boyfriends that are my pals, boyfriends are something more.. . But to a guy, I am almost certain girlfriend means more than just a friend you can call up and speak freely with without being judged, it's a person he holds more importance to than any other girl that he talks to, and values her opinion more than any other friends opinion.

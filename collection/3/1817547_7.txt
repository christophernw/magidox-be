everybody has ssomething to say about losing weight and toning up.it's all likely to confuse. my philosophy is simple.  this covers a seven day schedule. Day 1: eat 1 apple.  Day 2: eat 1 apricot . Day 3: eat a plum. Day 4: eat a grape. Day 5: a couple of Skittles. Day 6: a couple nuts. On the last day: eat 2 chocolate cream pies with 2-3 full cans of Rhedi Whip.  then purge.  I can assure you, that your looks will be the least of your worries.

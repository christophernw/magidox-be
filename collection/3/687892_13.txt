I think you've misquoted it - it's usually "All the glitters aint gold" etc - meaning don't get your hopes up - not everything is as it seems. Kind of like "don't count your chickens before they hatch". It's from Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice and it's a misquote - the original is "All that glisters is not gold".

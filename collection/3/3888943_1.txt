Yoga means linking to God.. Bhakti means devotion,so by devotion to God,one recreates the link to go back to Godhead or the spiritual world.. Jesus,and all prophets come to earth to teach us how to recreate that love path.Unfortunately,his words hasve been lost,due to messing around with his words.But his main teaching is "love one another,including animals and plants.."And also love "thy father who is in heaven",known in all cultures through various Names:Allah-Krishna-Rama-Manitou...Same God,same children:us all including animals and plants.

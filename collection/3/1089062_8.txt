It is funny how broad a sentence 4 words can make. Was something specific done to you by a Christian? If only one Christian, then why lump us altogether?.   Christians are not perfect. True Christians realize this. We make mistakes just like everyone else..   If I posted a question that said the same thing about Non-Christians, wouldn't you feel the same way many of us do? Don't lump us altogether. I am pretty sure I've personally never done anything to you. If I have, please forgive me. God isn't done with me yet. I am still a work in progress! :0)

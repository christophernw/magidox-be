I'd venture to say that it [the book] pretty much hits the mark and is close to 95% being ACCURATE in the historicity of the Bible, with the implication of what corruptions had been done by the early RCC, such as creating a smear campaign against JC's consort/spouse, MM.. . Another factor is the selection of Paulinian letters over all other Gospels of the rest of the Apostles, who were actual witnesses of JC when He walked the Earth, while Saul/Paul never did witness His ministry. In fact he acted as a Roman who was even given charge to persecute any and all of JC's followers. And the conclave of Apostles and disciples feared Saul/Paul's presence when he first met them in their secret place of gathering... according to Acts.. . Your presumptions are quite plausible and on the right track.. . Continue with your search for you are beginning to see a glimpse of 'light.'. . Peace be with you!

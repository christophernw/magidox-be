Temporary relief could come from Anbesol or Orajel, but most likely you'll have to see a dentist, get an x-ray and go from there.  Keep in mind that toothaches can lead to alot of other problems like sinus infections.  Don't put off the dentist.  The longer you wait, the more it could cost you.  Hope you feel better.

Fresh fish shouldn't smell. If you go fishing and you pull a fish out of the water and smell them. You'll find they have very little odor other than that of the water they were swimming. If a fish smells like what people think fish smells like the fish is spoiled. You are actually smelling decaying bacteria. Avoid that. Fish should feel firm with no discoloring. The eyes on the fish should be clear. Preferably you would buy fish that are still alive or from someone who is actually a fisherman. Grocery stores are the last place you should look.

Without information about your life, age, conditions, diet, work, expectations, etc. no-one can tell you the answer.. But you do know that your attitude to life might be making you miserable.. Look around you and realise how fortunate you are. I am assuming you have reasonable health, all four limbs, sight, hearing, etc.. Think how you would cope if you were blind or deaf or without limbs, or in pain. Realise how fortunate you are.. If this does not help, consider asking your GP to see a psychologist and explain to him/her your state of mind and whether you can get help.. Sometimes it helps just to express yourself to someone, a kind listener can indeed "halve your problems". Perhaps a medication is necessary, make sure it is NOT prozac, but something light to take the edge of this sadness and give you a buck up.. Walk a lot, and observe people. You might be expecting a level of happiness which does not exist. No-one is happy all the time.. Finally, make a list of what you think your problems are and try to change your life....with exercise, with a job that interests you, or an evening-course where you can learn something new, a language or a different country's cuisine to cook.. We only have this one life: it costs the same to be happy as to be miserable. Learn how to be happy.. Good luck!

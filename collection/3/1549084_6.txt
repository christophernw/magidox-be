Go to the woods and try to find you some merckle bush (I have no idea how that's spelled, but that's how it sounds)). Then just cut off some small leafy branches, and drop them all over your house. Fleas can't stand this stuff, and you will not have a problem with fleas in your house or on your pets, gauranteed.

Muslims commit less crimes in the world than any other religion. The only reason it seems the opposite is because the media has focused the majority of their news on what happens in the Middle East rather than elsewhere in the world. The so called "muslims" you see on tv commiting terrorist acts are not muslim, because they go against the foundation and teachings of Islam - to promote peace, love, and wisdom.. . If you still don't believe me, look at the statistics. In 1998, in Saudia Arabia, the murder rate was only 3. That's three, not 3000 or 3 million. In the US, in the same year, the murder rate was well over the 20 thousands.

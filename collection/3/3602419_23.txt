belly weight has been linked with high levels of stress. In addition to excersize and healthy eating, you may want to start finding ways to relieve stress. I actually lost weight just by starting to scrapbook! even though it's an activity I do while sitting on my butt, it relieves a lot of tension and allows me to express myself.

I use frozen spinach in my dip, thawed and drained (I put the spinach in a strainer and push the extra water out), I then drop the spinach in the food processor and hit that a couple of times, add a 1/2 a brick of cream cheese (softened) a 1/3 cup Miracle Whip, dried onion, garlic power and a dash of salt, pepper to taste. Then puree until smooth chill and garnish with rosemary leaves when served. My daughter loves the stuff (when she had cucumbers to eat it with) and was an all time favorite at family gatherings.

What is ISrael's claim to Israel as a state?  How about an unbroken presence in the country for the last 3500 years?  Hmm- and the fact that they are the ONLY people to have had an independent state there- before the Jews it was just a bunch of iron age and stone age tribes- moving slowly from nomadic, pastoral existence to city-states.  No country.. . After the Jews it was a province of one or another external ruler- it was never indepenedent.  So ISrael gets its legitimacy from having a population that has been there for 3500 years and being the only independent state to ever exist in the region!

It has to do with the termperature of the water in the pipes versus that of the water vapor in the room's air. If the water in the pipes is colder, the water vapor in the air that touches them will cool into water. So wet pipes are more likely when the room is relatively warm... or it is relatively cold outside, so the water in the pipes coming in from outside is colder than the air in the room.. . When you take a metal can of pop (or as some heathens say, "soda") off the grocery store shelf, it is room termperature inside the can and out; the can is dry. When you take it out of the refrigerator and sit it on the table, the liquid inside the can is colder than the air/vaopr in the room, and soon the can is wet... and has dripped onto the tablecloth.

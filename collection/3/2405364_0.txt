KO is the symbol for the Coca Cola Bottling Company.  Someone who has been KOed may have been fired by a Coca Cola distributor or lost money in the stock market by trading in puts and calls of Coca Cola Stock.  Any reference to boxing when referring to this stock would be incorrect as everyone knows that Coca Cola comes in bottles.

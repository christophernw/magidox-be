If she is bugging you and she's really this bad, she's bugging EVERYONE!  Talk to her sometime when the two of you will be alone for a while and let her know you ARE being her friend by telling her that she's probably overdoing it and being kind of annoying with the whole guy thing and she just needs to chill out.  Don't make a big deal out of this.  Just say it in passing very casually like it really doesn't bother you usually.  If she blows up at you for this then she probably has deep social/emotional/ challenges and you'll probably do yourself a favor by spending less time with her anyway.

Sweaty Palms, known medically as Palmer Hyperhidrosis, or excessive hand sweating, is the most common presentation of hyperhidrosis. The term "hypersympathetic activity" is more accurate terminology because excessive sweating is caused by heightened activity in the sympathetic chain. The sympathetic chain, part of the Autonomic Nervous System, is located within the chest cavity and has nothing to do with motoric or sensory functions. . Excessive hand sweating can be quite severe by affecting a patient's everyday life both functionally and socially. In about 40% of the patients the problem is genetic. Sweaty palms usually begins early in childhood and can get more severe towards the late teenage years and into early adulthood. . . The International Hyperhidrosis Society divides the severity of Palmar Hyperhidrosis or Excessive Hand Sweating into four subgroups. Group one consists of patients that have mild hand sweating that does not cause any functional or social problems. On the other end of the spectrum are patients with excessive hand sweating at a level of wetness described as dripping affecting them on a daily basis. Patients from the last group rarely have benefit from conservative measures such as Drysol, Drionic, Maxim, Oral Medications, or Botox.

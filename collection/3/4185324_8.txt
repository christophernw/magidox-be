They are charlatans trying to get you to give up your gold to them in return for the blessings they offer. They worship money & not God, so they use the "name it - claim -it" form of right. God never says that financial prosperity is our destination - nor shoudl it be our goal. There will always be those who use the Gospel for their own purposes. Trust in teh Lord and lean not on your own understanding.

Reincarnation does not happen.  We live life once and then we are judged by God for how we lived life on earth.. . Were we kind to our fellow man?  Were we wise and did we make good decisions about how we spent our time, how we spent our money, how we lived?  Did we seek to make the world a better place or did we selfishly fufill our own desires?  . . These are the tough questions we will have to face after we die if we do not face them now.. . The questions to ask yourself when choosing a mate is - are they loving?  are they faithful?  do they share the same goals and dreams that I have?  Will they stand by me when times get tough?  Be wise when you choose your mate.

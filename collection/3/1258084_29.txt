You'll get many different answers depending on the religion of the person answering.  I happen to be a Christian (Baptist) and I believe you have to accept Jesus as your Savior and believe in Him.  Once you do that you should try not to sin and ask for forgiveness when you do.. . If you're trying to be as bad as you can without crossing the line you might want to take a different approach if you're honestly concerned about this.  Good luck, God bless.

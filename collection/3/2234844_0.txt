also called a "chain reaction"- one event triggers another, which triggers another, and so on, so the end result is of a far greater scope than the original event.. . This is what has happened from 9/11, for instance. We have homeland security, illegal wiretaps, Patriot acts, airport screenings which harass the innocent, racial profiling, prejudice vs. innocent muslims who aren't terrorists, war in Iraq, and super-spiked gas prices...but have yet to actually catch Osama Bin Laden. So, in effect, he won.

I live in Texas, it is very hot right now, and this time of year it is usually hot during the day, but I would have to say summer.  One can get up in the morning and the earth has cooled, with the gentle breeze out doors and that blue blue sky to wake you up, as the bright sun raises higher in the sky getting hotter by the minute (yes the minute) and then as the heat of the day gives off that bit of stream from the earth and those wiggle lines of heat that make you just want to stop and sweat in the place you are standing until....twilight time.  . . Oh, my gosh, when it is twilight in Texas, as the blue sky is changes in colors of blues and yellow and oranges to deep purples, the wind comes up to touch your body in the most seductive way, and you sit on edge of your pool . knowing why you love Texas and the 5 months of summer.  Its a feeling of the world cloaking you in a warmth of splendor that is only understandable through the experience.

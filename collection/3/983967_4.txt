Never be a person who doesn't need help, there lies loneliness and "grumpy old so and so".  A great aunt used to accept all the offered help she could get whether she needed it or not.  That way she had visitors who kept an eye on her and people to gossip with as she couldn't get out much they all became friends.  At her funeral were loads of people we didn't even know and they all had a tale to tell of their visits with the old lady.

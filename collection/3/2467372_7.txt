all those answer were cute but the actual reason we yawn is as we become tired we do not remove the excess Co2 in our bodies, which is realease mainly by breathing and by gas exchange through the skin. it is Co2 build up that causes us to breath not the lack of oxygen. so as we get tired we don't breath as deep or move as much thereby building up of Co2 forcing us to take a deep breath.  . now why do we yawn when we see another person yawn? it is a natural/instictual response to harmonize the groups activity. as early man started forming group these group need coheavisness inorder to survive so they all started eating at the same time sleeping at the same time women became fertal at the same time etc. the same thing happens in nature. the female of a group all become fertal around the same time, parent birds regurgeatate their food when they see there chick open mouth (acutally it is the color change from white to red not the actual chick itselt combine with there crying) hope that helps

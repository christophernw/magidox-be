it means to make one particular object larger/out of scale. it is usually done to stress the importance of that object. Children do it naturally (make their mom huge in porpotion to themselves or a bird way larger than life) visual literacy naturally identifies this object as the focus. Sometimes it is used as a starting point in a painting, then the eye will move around the work starting from this point.

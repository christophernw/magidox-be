You can not make your sister do any thing she does not want to do. I understand your concern but she has to want to help her self. I would keep talking to her though. Try to make her understand that she is hurting her self and the risk she is taking like diabetes and heart diesese or even heart attacks. I know it is hard to watch her doing this to her self but she has to want to help her self first.

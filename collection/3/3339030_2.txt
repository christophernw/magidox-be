frequent urination means taking trips to the bathroom fairly often, compared to your normal  routinethis would mean that if you went to the bathroom every hour and a half, you may be going once every 30 minutes. however, if you are concerned that you may have diabetes, i wouldn't worry abbout it unles you had other symptoms, because you may just have a urinary tract infection, or if you are an older man, an enlarged prostate

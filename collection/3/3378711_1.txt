Walgreens' headquarters is in Deerfield, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. I would suggest that you visit one of their pharmacies in Peoria and find out the office you should contact in Deerfield about charitable giving.. . I assume you are an administrator at a community college - it would not do any good for anyone else to contact Walgreens about this. If you are not a college administrator, then you should go to a community college and talk with the president about expanding into a storefront in your area.. . s

You have really had it tough.  I can only suggest you see your doctor and tell him/her - or if you feel you cannot explain directly, print out your question and show it to them.  It sounds as if you need serious counselling and they will be the best way to find someone to help you. . . In the meantime, one small aid for panic attacks is 7/11 breathing;  breathe in while you count to 7, breathe out while you count to 11 at the same pace.  Do this at least 8-10 times, and you really will feel a little calmer and more settled.  If you can do it 12-15 times, it will work even better.. . I send you my best wishes and prayers.

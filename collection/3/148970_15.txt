Question for the Mormons: Do you eat chocolate, which contains caffeine? Do you drink herbal teas?  If you prohibit hot drinks would cold herbal tea be acceptable. . . I’m just asking because I try not to offend anybody by giving them anything that is against their religion.. . And I don’t want to break my streak of no questions by asking as a separate question.

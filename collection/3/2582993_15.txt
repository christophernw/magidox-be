Ah, more indications that  Creationist contortion still goes on, trying to bend in any direction that will allow a literal reading of an allegorical book.. . Questions like this are important to continue putting scientific truth in front of people.  I agree, facts are an important thing to put in front of people and, unfortunately, some people will always reject facts that contradict belief.. . I have visited the "answersingenesis" site, based on others' posts and find it to be as selective in its readings of science as many religious people, particularly Fundamentalist Christians [sic] are in their reading of their bible -- only understanding it up to the point where proof is presented, and then rejecting the proof.  . . The objects that are "fossil-like" are only that: fossil-LIKE.  They would easily be recognized as not being fossils, which are not only dated through carbon-testing, but on the rock strata in which they are found.. . Why is there a war on science?  My father was a scientist and a Christian and never had these qualms or issues at all.  He knew where to draw the line between faith and reality.. . Keep up the good fight.

Just figure out why you are such a jerk.  Do the following.  Write down all the people you are a jerk to.  Next to each name, write down why you are such a jerk to each person.  Next to that, write down how you feel when you are a jerk to each person.  Then write down what happens when you are a jerk.  Now look at all you have written down.  It should be pretty obvious why you`are a jerk and then you can decide if you want to keep it up or change yourself.  And it should be pretty clear how to change it.

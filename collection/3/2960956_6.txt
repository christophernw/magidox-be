5 months is still a pretty short time. You are loosing weight wich is good, don't get discouraged. Your skin is still lose and will slowly shrink back to place. It might give you the impression that you are not losing fat at all but you are for sure.. . I am a man and like most men, don't mind a woman with such handles. Don't be too hard on yourself.

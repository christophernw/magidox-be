I believe your friend may have said "Wiccan" not "Wicked" -- the two are often grouped together, but as someone who prefers the other definition of Wicked (that being extreme and good, not evil and bad), I'd say that you probably mis-heard what your friend said.. . True Wiccans, it is my understanding, are more about earth religions and are more druidic in their practices than the typical interpretation of witchcraft.. . The study of witchcraft has always held a certain appeal for teenagers, but I think it's become more "mainstream" with the current generation than such things were when I was in my teens.. . If you have a question about what the girl said, call her and ask.

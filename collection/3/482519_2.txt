As above, it's from the cockney rhyming slang:. raspberry  . 1623, earlier raspis berry (1548), possibly from raspise "a sweet rose-colored wine" (c.1460), from Anglo-L. vinum raspeys, origin uncertain, as is the connection between this and O.Fr. raspe, M.L. raspecia, raspeium, also meaning "raspberry." One suggestion is via Old Walloon raspoie "thicket," of Gmc. origin. Meaning "rude sound" (1890) is shortening of raspberry tart, rhyming slang for fart.

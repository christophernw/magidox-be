People can't be real because everyone responds to other's reality differently. Everyone responds to others differently even when they hide stuff. It's better to not share everything. This is learned through life. This is why kids are brutally honest with everyone, and adults mind their words. These are generalities, I do know there are kids who mind their manners and aren't so forward, and that there are adults who arent' polite,and very forward.

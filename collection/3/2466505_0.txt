"Sugar is by nature highly hydroscopic, meaning that it attracts moisture. Cookies are much higher in sugar than bread, but lower in moisture. When bread and cookies are placed together in a closed container, the moisture in the bread raises the ambient humidity. In an attempt to equalize the moisture levels of the two, the sugar in the cookies attracts the humidity provided by the bread and the cookies soften."

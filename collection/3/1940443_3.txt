I agree with Spanky.  Plus, having a "egalitarian" government does not assure that all resources will be disbursed equally.  This is especially true in health care.  Life saving medical treatment and/or prevention is rationed off because the government cannot afford to provide it to everyone.  A perfect example of this is mammograms.  In socialized countries the deaths from breast cancer run higher due to the fact that early detection cannot be provided due to the rationing of the service.

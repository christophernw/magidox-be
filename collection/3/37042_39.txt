The modern school system makes no sense. Where in our lives will we ever be put into a room with 30 people our own ages doing work that will amount to nothing? Also, the teachers and principles have too much power over our kids. I heard of a person who tried to get their child out of special help because by the state guidelines the child did not qualify at that moment. (he did when he went in) The school was so mad that the child was not forced to go by the parents that an all out war which ended up costing the parents a lot of money they did not have. And the child was scared mentally because of the terrible things the teachers and principal said to him. In the end the parents were out and out slandered by these school officials and had no recourse to punish back, because the school officials were acting in an official manner. A good hard working family who love their kids and each other was ruined. I think that's a good reason to go private schools or home school.

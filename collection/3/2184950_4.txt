Gold is not very reactive. Unlike silver, which tarnishes when exposed to sulfur and many of its compounds, gold is the only metal that does not react with sulfur. Further, it is not affected by many acids. Only aqua regia or "kingly water", a 3:1 mixture of concentrated HCl and HNO3, will dissolve gold.

God says there is none righteous. No! Not one. All our works are as filthy rags. It is only by Christ giving us His righteousness through the gift of salvation that one can have righteousness. You sound like you are a stranger to grace. You should have asked something to the effect of "How can I treat others the way I want to be treated and how does this fall into God's perfect plan?"

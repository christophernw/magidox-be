Don't drink more that 1 oz. of hard liquor, 1 12 oz. beer, or one 4 oz. glass of wine in each hour.  This gives your liver time to filter out the toxins.  Of course, if you want to get drunk, this won't work for you.  If that's the case, drink a glass of milk or eat a container of yogurt before you drink.  For the hangover, drink lots of water to rehydrate your system, try to eat some chicken soup, and try not to take aspirin or acetaminophen if you have a headache, because the aspirin will cause further damage to your stomach lining, and the acetaminophen can further damage your liver.  Ginger ale is good, because it contains sugar, which will help the headache, and stays down better than water.. . Also, (you probably know this one,) you shouldn't mix different drinks in one night.  That can make some people really sick even if they're not drunk.

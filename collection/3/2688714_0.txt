You don't say what year these cars are from.  GM used to use a 3.4 DOHC in it's Lumina 2-doors, and possibly for a few years in the next style of monte.  GM also has a regular OHV 3.4 built on the same orders as a 2.8 and 3.1 V6.  The DOHC one is rated at 200 or 210 depending on what transmission is behind it, and the OHV engine is rated anywhere from 165 to 185 horsepower.

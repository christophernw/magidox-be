Humans DID NOT evolved from apes, humans share the same ancestors with apes, and chimps.  Our common ancestors separated with the great apes more than 10 million years ago. And chimps and humans separate from their common ancestors about 7 million years ago.. . It is long after we became separate species, that we human venture out  of Africa, and into Europe and Asia.

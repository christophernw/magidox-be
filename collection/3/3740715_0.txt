I think the question pertains to whether seedless grapes are a genetically modified crop - the answer is no.  They're bred just like, as was said, black tulips, or dairy cows or golden retrievers.  The same process humans have been using for thousands of years.  And the bit about cuttings was right, but that's not unique to seedless grapes - that's how basically all grapevines are propagated.

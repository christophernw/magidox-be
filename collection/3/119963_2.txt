He was notable because he started WWII and tried to take over the world.. We remember him now because of the Holocaust, where millions of people were killed.. His mother and a painting of God inspired him.. I'm not sure about his childhood, other then that he was very close with his mother.. The Nazi parti was a party of supremecists who believed that they could create a 'perfect' society and those who wern't 'perfect' deserved to be killed.

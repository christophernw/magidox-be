First go to your pharmacy and buy some MedPeds medicated socks, sometimes you can find them at Wal-Mart, these socks contain aloe Vera in the fiber.  Then soak your feet to loosen the dead skin, slather your feet with bag balm, then go to bed. This should take care of the problem.  My father has diabetes and this is how he takes care of his feet.

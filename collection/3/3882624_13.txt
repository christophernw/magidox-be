Islam is the religion of peace, or as us muslims like to call it. NOT all muslims are what you see or read in the papers. We are a pretty decent group of people. The basic belief is simple; To believe in ONE God [ALLAH] and to believe that Prophet Mohammad was the last prophet [messenger] or God. . . Besides that Islam is based on FIVE principles; Tauheed [the belief in one-ness of God], Praying, fasting, pilgrimage & charity [Zakaah]. . . We pray 5 times each day. We fast during the holy month of Ramadan [according to the Islamic calender] for 29 or 30 days each year. Additionally we observe some voluntary fasts [Fasting that is not obligatory but done only to please God]. Pilgrimage is the Hajj. Muslims tarvel from all over the world to Makkah and perform pilgrimage there. Zakaah or charity is the annual donation made by a muslim on the amount of wealth he or she owns for a whole year. The charity is given to the poor and the needy of the society.. . The teachings of Islam are based upon the HOLY QURAN, which we Muslims believe is the true word of God and was revealed unto prophet Mohammad [PBUH]. If there is anything that can not be 'understood' properly by our average minds, we turn to the teachings and sayings of our Prophet. After that there is Fiqh, which needs alot of explanations lol. . . Traditions; . Death: when a person dies, he's given a 'bath' and then covered with white piece of cloth. He is taken to the grave-yard where the people pray for the body and tehn he is burried. The grave shouldn't be 'embellished' or anything. Birth: When a Muslim child is born, the father or a close relative says the Azaan [or the call to prayer] in his right year. After that something sweet is put in the child's mouth [such as honey]. After 7 days of the birth, an animal [Halal] is slauhtered in the name of God and the meat is distributed among people [usually in our society their is a proper party]. . Marriage: is done in a simple manner too. The groom asks the bride's father's or gaurdian's permission to allow him to marry his daughter. After that they exchange vows [which is more like a marriage contract] and they are married. I should mention here that the bride's father or some gaurdian should be present at the time of the signing the contract. . . We don't go to churches. We have mosques that we pray in 5 times daily. Usually in Islamic countries only men go to mosques as it is better and convenient for women to pray at homes. . . We don't celebrate the same things as christians. We celebrate Eids. There are two Eids per each year. One Eid, Eid-al-FITR is celebrated after the month of Ramadan [the holy month of fasting] and the other one, Eid-al-ADHA is after the Hajj. Usually, the day starts by performing special prayers [Eid prayers] and then exchange of sweets. Meat is slaughtered on eid-al-adha [the one after the Hajj]. . . . THAT WAS LONG lol. Hope I helped a bit :)

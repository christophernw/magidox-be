Cannabis Indica, located originally in Pakistan, Afghanistan and India, has great heeling power and is used in ayurvedic medicine up to now.. marijuana was a very common, and effective medicine, also across Europe. Popular was the ability of marijuana, it could be used for many different deceases. The plant is not capricious, and can be planted easily, the price therefor was very small. Also a part of the plant was used for production of very strong and robust materials for clothes. up to now it is used for the ropes on ships. In the beginning of 20-th century, Industry was developing rapidly, also the medicine became industry. Not being able to handle such a successful concurrence, the medical industry caused a new law, which made marijuana illegal.. well i know it is not answering Ur question properly, but i hope it gives u a better idea about marijuana.

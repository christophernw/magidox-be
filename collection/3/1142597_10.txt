As someone who has spent years working in the retail trenches, I can tell you that customer service has evolved as the customer themselves have evolved. Sure, once upon a time customer service reps were trained to be courteous and polite to the customer. I imagine that was back around the time that customers still displayed common courtesy, manners and respect for those who were working to serve them. I started working retail because I liked people, in fact, I considered myself a "people person" and was one of those genuinely friendly customer service folks that you are recalling fondly. At least I was for the first five years or so. During that time, I was cussed at, screamed at, hit, spit on, had things thrown at me and was just generally abused by the general public. 99.9% of the time, these episodes had nothing whatsoever to do with me. I even once had a customer spit on me and throw their broken cell phone at me (hit me in the arm), despite the fact that I  was doing the best I could to help him and when I finally got him calmed down enough to speak to me in a normal fashion, I realized that he didn't even have his cell phone through our carrier. When I explained this to him, did he apologize for his abusive and rude behavior? Of course not, he just yelled at me for wasting his time. During all of this, I was supposed to smile, agree and make nice with the customer because "the customer is always right". . . Well, after nearly 10 years in the service industry, I had to get out because I couldn't take it anymore. So, the next time you think that your customer service person isn't quite as friendly as you'd like, try being a bit extra friendly to them...after all, they're on their feet all day, they're working for minimum wage and they've probably been called every name under the sun by at least two or three other customers that day for things that are beyond their control.

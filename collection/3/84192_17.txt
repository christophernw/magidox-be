Yes, and often companies make mistakes like throwing off the good guy for the guy with the degree.. But, then in just a few years to come, you will see those companies merge with other companies, because they are loosing their butts, or you will see them down sizing, and then with in time loosing the company....When a company looses the American TRUST that is what happens to them.... they become big and impersonal and it falls apart..

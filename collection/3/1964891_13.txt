poor jews ...Irish starved to death ..blacks were beaten killed  sold at market.. hundreds of native americans tribes were totally exterminated. All cultures have their tales of hell. Babies die everyday ..this is misery to us humans which are only here for a blink of an eye..The long term of the soul is what counts and lasts not earthly tribulations, they are just filler in the whole scheme of existance

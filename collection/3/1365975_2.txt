For someone walking, it is STATIC friction that is acting, not KINETIC friction since the person's feet are not in motion relative to the ground while they are in contact with the ground (unless the person is slipping). So, in terms of the static friction, as a person walks, they are bushing backwards against the ground and the static friction is what is pushing against them, pushing them forward, so again it IS in the opposite direction to the force being applied.

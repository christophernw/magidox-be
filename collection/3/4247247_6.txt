But in the 1800s and today pre-marital sex is still wrong, and so is murder, lying, deceit, jealousy, extra-marital affairs, blasphemy, cursing.... It doesn't matter if it's common place - it's still wrong.. . God is just and all-knowing. People born after the proliferation of Christianity with the knowledge of His life and resurrection and who also deny his deity and offer of salvation will be judged accordingly. I have not completely formed an opinion on "eternal damnation" due to some questions I have regarding the translation of the Greek words for "eternal" (some insist that the word "eternal" has been incorrectly translated, and should read "an eon", which does have a definite ending point). I think that God will perhaps refine the non-believers through fire (although I don't know if it will be a literal fire). I think that His goal may be to force non-believers to recognize what His Son did for them, and if they have gone through their entire life in denial of that salvation, He's gonna drive that point home. Judgement will not occur until after Jesus Christ has made His return... it's called the Great White Throne Judgement, I believe. At that point, all non-believers will be judged, and from what I deduced from the Bible, it will not be a mandatory "life sentence" for all. He will examine each individually and sentence according to the person's character and actions they made in their life.

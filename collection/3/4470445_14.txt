The original seat position is down.  Everyone sits down at some point during the day.  Only men use the up position.  Consequently, it is up to men to put the seat up.  It is then common courtesy to return the seat to its proper, original position-down. However, I do agree that both the seat and the lid should be down for both aesthetic and sanitary reasons.

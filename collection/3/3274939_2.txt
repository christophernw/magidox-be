You can't always know for certain.. I just flirt with everybody and see who responds (but I may not be a good role model).. . If you're not very confident, just try to appear friendly and approachable, and keep smiling at him, to see if he gets the hint and approaches you. Otherwise, just go up and ask him - he can only say no, and he might be flattered, even if he's not interested.

Probably none.  People will still speak the language in which they are most comfortable.  Business will advertise in the language of he customers they wish to attract.  The DMV and registrars of voters will publish in the languages needed in their communities and teachers will do their best to reach all of their students.. . The biggest difference will be that some polititians will be able to pat themselves on the back for "doing something" about the illegal alien question and tens of  thousands of dollars will be wasted on the effort.

Cockatoos are Parrots- and "Parrots" and "Cockatoos", as well as "Cockatiels", "Macaws" and "Parakeets" are different classifications of "Parrot" families.. . Let me explain this further:. . Parrots or Psittacines (order Psittaciformes) includes about 353 species of bird which are generally grouped into two families: the Cacatuidae or cockatoos (cockatiels are disputed as being cockatoos or true parrots- this is something that is outside family orders), and the Psittacidae or true parrots (African Greys, Parakeets, Amazons and birds with "Parrot" in their name). The term parrot is generally used for both the entire order as well as for the Psittacidae alone.. . All members of the order have a characteristic curved beak shape with the upper mandible having slight mobility in the joint with the skull and a generally erect stance. All parrots are zygodactyl, meaning having the four toes on each foot placed two at the front and two back.. . ********. . If someone get Psittacosis (or Parrot Fever) from a parrot, that bird had to be sick. This disease is aptly named as it only is developed in Psittistine birds, however, it can be transmitted to any bird once full-blown. This is a rare but deadly disease that only effects birds with an effected immune system. It is not common, and is treatable in both birds and humans. Most humans can brush it off, as well as birds as long as they are healthy and the immune system is not suppressed in any way.

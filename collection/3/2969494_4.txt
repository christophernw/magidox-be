The old immigrants wanted to become Americans,they would get off the ships and kiss the ground they were so happy to be here.They wanted to assimilate into this country as quickly as they could.They learned English,sometimes by going to night school after a long hard day at work.They kept some of their old world ways but they were eager to learn about their new homeland.. The new immigrants are not a whole lot different except the fact that there are so many of them of one ethnic heritage that they don't feel the urgent need to assimilate as quickly or as completely as the old immigrants did.. The illegal aliens are an entirely different type of people.But you didn't ask about them so I wont elaborate.

I still wonder what people's fascination with this word is and attempting to justify its use because someone else uses it. Its alot like if somebody jumps off a bridge, are you going to follow?? Also, I grew up in NYC and their are alot of ethnic groups that use words to describe themselves that are exclusive to them, why no big question as to why Irish, Italians, or any other group call themselves micks, or guineas? Would you go up to a group of Italian gentleman and start dropping the "g" word, or go to an Irish bar and begin calling everyone the "m" word, I think not Why?? It has nothing to do with political correctness, it has to do with doing something foolish that could get you physically hurt. So, like I have heard a thousand times today you do have freedom of speech and if you want to call someone the "n" or any ethnic or racial slur, go right ahead, but chose your choice of location wisely.. One more thing about us calling ourselves African American why is their so much discussion about this, if this is what we chose to call ourselves, so be it. If you don't like it ---tough! Now go to Little Italy and ask why they fly Italian flags, or step up on St. Patty's day and pull down the Irish flags. Go to any big city and you will see flags from all over the world flying, so before you question what I chose to call myself go ask them why they arent flying American flags.  Their is such a double standard applied in matters like this it really makes me wonder why  people act like their is a raging race war going on in this country. No, last time I looked their wasn't just a bunch of racists hiding behind "I just want to know why...." questions. It truly makes me sick.

If I had a girlfriend, I'd hold onto the back of her neck/head, glide my hand through her hair and kiss her lips at an angle.  I would gently grab the upper part of her lip with my lips.  I'd toy around with her lips for a little bit-tease her.  Then, I would slip in my tongue at the right moment.  If she was comfortable with that next move, then I would go deeper with the kissing and circle my tongue around hers...

the balance in the bank account means how much money you have at that moment. there could be checks that have not cleared the bank yet. so always check which ones have cleared. most banks offer a telephone service where you can access you account. there you can find out which checks have cleared and which are outstanding. take the bank balance and subtract all checks which have not cleared. this gives you your true balance and keeps you from getting charges for bounced checks or overdraft charges. good luck

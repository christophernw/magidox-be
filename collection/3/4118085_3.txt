In the sense of allowing the car to go in the direction it wants, it "drifts" due to no forced steering by the driver. You may have felt that when you want the car to go in a certain direction, it takes a little effort (try it without power steering!). On the freeway, if you let go of the wheel the car will tend to drift with the angle of the road, or with the angle of misalignment in the tires. You typically do not make a car drift, you let it drift. A car with well alligned tires, and on a very flat road may not drift at all.. . Although in a race when the wheels loose traction - which you may force, the car may start drifting as well. So, coming around a sharp turn, if he was going very fast, the rear wheels could start sliding to the outside of the turn, actually helpong someone who knows what they are doing (NOT ME) to make a tighter turn.

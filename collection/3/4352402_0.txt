For the last two thousand years, it has been a good idea to still take care of your own business despite the fact the Bible says the world will one day end.. . The bible did not give an actual date that the world would end on.. . Eventually, maybe billions of years from now the sun will go dark, or supernova, or something.  Other disasters could befall it too.. . So, nobody claims/believes the Earth will be a viable home forever.. . Still, it is a good idea to take care of business in the meantime.

If you are talking about the Angels that are up in heaven, then I have to tell you that you are wrong, they don't "earn wings"  . . They are invisible creatures, hence, they do not have wings.  You cannot see them.  I don't know why we think of angels as creatures that are cuddly and have wings.  They're not cupids.

DVD's are harder to read as they contain more data.  If your laser is out of alignment or going bad I would say this is not out of the question.  But as it was pointed out earlier are you talking about DVD's purchased in the store or burned DVD's???  Burned DVD's can not be read by all DVD players and even at that are harder to read then pressed DVD's.

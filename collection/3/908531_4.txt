CALL YOUR VET.  By rights people say the dog is able to leave at 8 weeks of age.  But I say if it is a smal toy breed they need to be with the breeder longer.  I let my pups go at 12 weeks of age.  . . Right now your pup should still be under the mother atie boties around 12 weeks is when it starts whereing off.. . I'm very worryed it might be a blocedge that is haveing you pup get sick often.  You really need a vet and after that call the breeder.  I hope the breeder gave you a health geritee.

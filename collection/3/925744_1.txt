I have only played the original...but my friend just bought the new one..and i'm jealous. *laughs*. . there's another story line at the end and a lot more content. It's also cheaper than the original one was and it's on pc.. . I would totally buy the new version...if i was interested in fable anymore. *smiles and wanders off*

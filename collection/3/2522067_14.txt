No one denies that Saddam Hussein was a monster. However, the "War on Terror" was supposed to be a response to the 9/11 attacks. And in case you've forgotten, it was Osama bin Laden, not Saddam Hussein, who was responsible for the attacks. By the way, where the hell is Osama bin Laden? It's been nearly 5 years since the 9/11 attacks, and he STILL hasn't been caught! When is his evil going to be confronted?. . By the way, we are the United States of America, not the World Police. It's not our responsibility to "liberate" people in brutal dictatorships just so that we can drive ourselves into a record debt and alienate the rest of the world.

one thing you can do, without building bulky muscle, is to just tone your body. this will make you lean and skinny but at the same time be toned (muscles will show and you will look buff but without becoming huge and bulky).  do situps or crunches for your abs and everything else, just use little weight with a bunch of reps.  that will keep you toned and give you the look of a swimmer/surfer/skater.

I read somewhere that when the Antichrist does rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem, that the Jews will begin again with animal/blood sacrifices in the Temple.. . The Antichrist will rebuild the Temple, bring everything back into temple(The Ark of the Covenant, tables, etc.), the Jews will start doing animal/blood sacrifice again, BUT it is when the Antichrist will set up his throne in the temple and claim himself to be God, that is when the Jews will reject him.. . I did read about them starting up with the sacrifices, but it will only happen during the Tribulation when the Antichrist rebuilds the temple.  I also read too that they have the blueprints already for the new temple......getting nearer to the end

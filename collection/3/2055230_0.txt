My one year old dog used to do that in the bathroom, we keep the door open and still do, just make sure you watch them and if you see that they are going for the trash, scold them!  They eventually catch on that it is not a good thing to do... also, you could by the covered garbage cans (small or large) to keep them from getting into the garbage! and my dog loves hot sauce, but the bitter apple spray typically works for most dogs!  Good luck...

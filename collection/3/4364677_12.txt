World peace is an illusion, there has never been and will never be world peace. . The christian vs muslim conflict is also an illusion, it is a clash of cultures and migration patterns. People expand beyond the means of their territory, they need new territory, the only option is to take it from someone else, conflict results. . The muslims outbreed the christians about three to one, guess who is going to win.. When more than two people get together conflict can and usually results.

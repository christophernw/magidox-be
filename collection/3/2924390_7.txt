Organized religion is a hypocritical mess. I've had "catholic" friends who would go to church, and cry about god, and then get home and have sex and do hard drugs. People are afraid of death, and they want to believe there's going to be paradise, when in reality, there's going to be a pine box under 6 feet of dirt. I chose logic over religion.

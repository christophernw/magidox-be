Mary was not a prostitute contrary to popular myth. She was caught in the act of adultery, which does not mean she was accepting money for her services. Your body is worth more than whatever price youwould put on it for sex. Especially if you factor in Aids and other std's. not to mention the women who are killed each day by their pimps or clients.

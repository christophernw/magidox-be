As a photography student I have found that this differs from film and digital. If you are usingh film then you are obviously using black and white film, make sure your shots are very well lit and white balances are done correctly. If you are suing digital then it is much easier if you shoot colour and use software such as Adobe photshop to alter the shot to black and white. This is better because you can manually take out colour and light as apose to been stuck with a black and white original. Hope this helps

Reverse the question.  How would you feel if someone asked "why are black people so racist?"  If you are offended you should be.  That is a racist question.  White people are no more racist than any other race or ethnic group.  Sometimes we have beliefs (not necessarily based in reality) and then we go out looking for confirmation for those beliefs.  That can cause skewed thinking.  It's also not scientific.

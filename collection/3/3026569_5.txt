Basically, it contains a microphone, an amplifier, and a speaker. The sound picked up by the microphone is played louder into the wearer's ear to compensate for their hearing loss.. . Many (but not all) hearing aids are tailored to amplify some sounds more than others: for example, many people suffer a higher degree of hearing loss at high frequency, so the hearing aid would amplify high frequency sounds more than low frequency sounds. . . A growing area is customised hearing aids, where the amplification characteristics of the hearing aid are programmed to suit the specific individual: a bit like a "graphic equaliser" in a stereo system. This is usually done once, at the time of fitting, using special equipment.

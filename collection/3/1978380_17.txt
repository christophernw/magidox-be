I would travel into the 1800's because everthing was so simple, rude people were uncommon and people didn't need computers, phones, air conditioners, and planes to keep happy. Also people could walk somewhere without the worry of getting raped, kidnapped, killed, or whatever. The world was just a whole LOT safer.

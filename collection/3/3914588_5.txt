Draw a segment.  Put a dot in the middle.  Open your compass and put the point of the compass on the dot.  Mark two arcs on the segment, one on either side of the dot.  Then open up the compass a little wider.  Put the point on one of the arcs, and make a new arc above the original dot.  Make the arc long enough so that when you move the point of the compass to the other arc on the segment, you can make a fourth arc that intersects the third arc.  The line passing through this intersection and your original dot will be perpendicular to the original segment so you will have a right angle.

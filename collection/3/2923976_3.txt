Well depending on where you live if you only have to pay 1000 then you are lucky..I had a dog chase a little girl didn't touch her or bite her and they deemed her vicious and told me to either have her put down or get $500,000 insurance on her.....Might want to check into your local laws to see what they have as far as dog biting because in the state I live in I was screwed...not to mention they charged me with misdemeanor's for owning a vicious dog....who has never bit a soul in her whole life....

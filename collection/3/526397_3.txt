Bedrock had it right when he mentioned the Ignition Control Module.  Everyone's about right with the distributor though.  It's all relevant since I'm almost positive the ICM is on the distributor anyway.  Check that out.  If you don't now, I got $5 that says your truck will be hard to start on humid days as well, and it'll take about 20 minutes to get it fired up again.

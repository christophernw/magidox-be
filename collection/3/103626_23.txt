First, wean him to just one or 2 small children.  Then to 1 medium child.  At this point introduce kittens or puppies with the medium child.  After a while, only offer him the kittens or puppies and then you can move to full-size cats and dogs.  Remember to adjust his diet of kittens and puppies so he gets the nutrition he needs and does not get fat.  Good luck and have fun!

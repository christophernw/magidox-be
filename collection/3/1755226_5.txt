E=m*c^2 basically tells us how much energy would be released if a mass was completely destroyed (that is converting it into energy). . It does not mean a body at the speed of light has that energy given by the equation as the speed is unachievable. because as one approaches the speed of light mass increases approaching infinity and we all know how much energy is required to increase the speed of a near infinit mass... almost infinity. . A more accurate relation would be . E=(m*c^2)/(1-(v/c)^2)^(1/2). where m is the mass of the body when it is at rest. this accounts even for its kinetic energy or relativistic energy

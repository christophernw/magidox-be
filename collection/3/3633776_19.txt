I really suggest that you understand evolution a little better before criticizing people because they have evaluated it against the evidence.. . Are you aware of the difference between micro- and macro-evolutionary theory?  If so, then your question is intentially misleading.  If not, then perhaps to learn the difference.. . Are you advocating gradual evolutionary theory or a punctuated version?  Are you aware of the difference?  Are you aware of the evidence and how it forced evolutionary biologist's to modify their theory?  Are you aware that evolutionary biologists strongly disagree among themselves as to what the theory of evolution is, when it occurs and what the fossil record reflects?. . No?. . Ok, but since you are on a roll, explain the process of evolution.  And no, your question isn't a description of the process, but rather a description of your evidence.  A process description would include the cause and effect, triggers, etc.. . And for the bonus question, how did non-living matter evolve into life?  By definition, if something is non-living, then it is not breeding and there can be no subsequent generations for improvement.  When you can explain that first instance of evolution of life to non-life, then we'll have a real debate.. . I suggest you learn a bit more about metaphysics before wading out in the deep end...

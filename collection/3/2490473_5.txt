Ok, if it is pierced, take out the piercing. Do not use Hydrogen Peroxide. Use Bactine, it cleans and promotes healing better. While peroxide may kill the intial infection, it also wipes away all the cells your body is sending to your wound. Your doctor may give you something for the pain. Change the bandage daily and keep it as dry as possible. There maybe a build up of puss. Bite a rolled up hand towel and squeeze that puppy. And keep it clean. you may use a little Bacitracin cream for the wound to help it heal.

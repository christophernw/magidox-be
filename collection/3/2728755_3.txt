To free millions of people from a murderous regime. However many self-centered people might believe that freeing millions of people from a murderous regime is nobody's business. This is the type of person who would cross the street to avoid helping an old lady who's being mugged. "It's none of MY business!" I guess human rights and God's will aren't allowed to cross arbitrarily designated politcal borders!

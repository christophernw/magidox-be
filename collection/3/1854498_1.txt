Not all glass is transparent. Naturally-occurring glass, such as obsidian, a natural volcanic product, is generally opaque. Clear glass is rather difficult to make, and in the early days of glassmaking, centuries ago, most glass was colored in some way. You need to exclude the pigments and materials that will absorb some of the light waves, leading to the glass being 'colored'. Clear glass just doesn't contain those coloring agents.

It's not an easy job. You have to disconnect the speedo cable art the back of the speedometer., and at the other end of the cable, you have to disconnect it from the gearbox.  You then have to connect your new cable at the gear box and route the cable exactly as the old one was. then connect the other end of the cable to the back of the speedometer. Not an easy job perhaps you should let a garage do it for you.

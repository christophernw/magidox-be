I would just say stay in touch with him, good friends are hard to find sometimes.  It's so easy to go on with everyday life and then the next minute you are wondering what your friend is up to.  You can keep your friendship alive through some sort of communication.  Like someone else said your friend is still alive so it's not a loss unless you or he make it one.

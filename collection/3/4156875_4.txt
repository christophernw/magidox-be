Most states have laws that allow a person to make up to a certain amount at home for personal use.  As long as you don't try to sell it, you should be fine.  After all, how is law enforcement going to know you are home brewing?  They have better things to do than arrest you for brewing an extra gallon of beer over the "limit."

Ketchup (or Catsup) (Or "catchup", even!) was brought to the "West" by Dutch & British sailors from China where it was called "ketsiap" (or something approximating that in Mandarin or Cantonese).. . So "Ketchup" and "Catsup" were just Western mispronounciations of the original word.  . . It came from the orient as a fish-based condiment, and the tomatoes got added later!. . Ronald Reagan (!) is responsible for mainstreaming the use of the word in the form "ketchup", it was under his watch that this condiment was formally declared a "vegetable" to help meet school lunch vegetable quota requirements, so a standard spelling & nomenclature was required by the FDA.  Way to go, Ronnie!

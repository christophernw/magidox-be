it's true we use different parts of our entire brain, we just aren't able to use it to it's full potential because we don't live long enough to. sad huh? we'll never know just how much our brains can contain. Enough has been shown though just how amazing our brains are, like people who are in car accidents and "lose" the ability to speak, only to regain it some time later, because the brain "rewired" itself. The brain is awesome.

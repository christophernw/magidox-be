Its not legal to keep wild birds.   Your best bet is to call the vet, because not ever bird eats the same things and if you give it the wrong food you could kill it.    There are several hand rearing mixes on the market and the vet will tell you which is best.    If you live in Australia i d say call wires.    Best of luck

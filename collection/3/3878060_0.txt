We all have our own thoughts about ourself.  Some of us are cocky while others constantly worry about their own imperfections.  We are all imperfect.  Worrying about your weight is not wrong, in fact, its very normal.  There is nothing wrong with you.  It is better to focus on your weight like you do than to not focus on it and let yourself get out of hand and actually put on uneeded weight.  So don't beat yourself down about your weight.  You can worry about it but don't let it control your thoughts.  It is better to recognize things about yourself than to ignore them and not focus on them.  Just keep thinking positive things and you shall have bliss.

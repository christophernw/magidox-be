Have you thought about a harness for your rabbit? You could take him on daily walks outside, but be aware that you don't walk the rabbit; he walks you. . I wouldn't worry too much about his energy unless he started gaining weight. My ferrets sleep 16 hours a day and are both at very healthy weights.

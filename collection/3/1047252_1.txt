I would like to know where you received your statistical information.  As I live in the South I see that we are no less intelligent than people from the North. Personally I find your question distasteful and ignorant.  Charlotte, North Carolina has grown into a huge banking city.  Atlanta, Georgia has also experienced a huge growth in business.  Virginia is the site of some of the oldest learning institutions in the country (William and Mary, University of Virginia).  Virginia is also considered "the mother of the presidents" because several were born and raised in that fine state.. . I have met people who grew up in the North and have later come to the South to live.  These people all enjoy life here in the South.  Our way of life may be simpler but sometimes it's the simple things that make life enjoyable.  . . I am not dumber than my Northern neighbors nor do I walk believing I am smarter.  Both areas of the country have their own attributes and short-comings.  Instead of enacting a sense of isolation between the two perhaps we should all begin to appreciate our differences and uniqueness.

i recently got bit on the hand it got infected.  the doctors were very concerned because it was right at the joint of my finger and they were worried about it getting in to the joint.  i was on antibiotics and out of work for a while.  yes it can be very dangerous.  the dog that bit be was very old and there was much more bacteria on it's teeth than a young dog would have.  just go to the doc and they'll help you.  just be sure you finish ALL of you meds.

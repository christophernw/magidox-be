I guess that depends on where in the world you are.. It depends on the content. . But pure water would have no taste to it. . It could however neutralize/dilute any existing taste in your mouth.. . Distilled water tastes like nothing.. . Natural spring water and fancy bottled waters taste like minerals.. . And most tap water tastes like chlorine.. . For me water is refreshing n exhilarating.. Water is life.. Water is a fundamental part of our lives. . It is easy to forget how completely we depend on it. . Human survival is dependent on water -- water has been ranked by experts as second only to oxygen as essential for life.. . So you know what something so important fro survival would  taste like! :)

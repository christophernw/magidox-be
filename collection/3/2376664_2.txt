It depends on who you ask and what you believe.. . A famous quote (can't remember who by, sorry and can't remember exact words either, apologies again) is that a teacher is one who ignites a fire, not one who fills a bucket.. . I've heard a million analogies throughout college and the beginning of my teaching career. But to me the role of a teacher is to provide knowledge, support, and guidance to a student in order to develop strategies for thinking and understanding.

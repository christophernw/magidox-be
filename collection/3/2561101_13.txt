I think it is because we always think we know better until we want advice from a specialist (eg doctor/builder ect.) Life experience is not a message anybody can bring across, we have to make up our own minds to decide what we want and what we don't, and nobody can ever tell us that - even though it would be better to take the advice and make the best of it. Learning the hard way always brings the 'message' across more clearly and it tends to stay with you longer that way aswell. A way of life cannot be explained, just demonstrated, it is up to us whether we want to adapt to that or whether we want to create our own. And wanting to adapt to our parents have never been the priority or life long dream of anybody I know...

The other ideas are really good. But do you have a community/techinal college near you? They ususally have classes in crochet/knitting and more. Do use large knitting or crochet needles to start with, because most people tend to put to much tension or pull on the thread as beginngers. Be patient you won't learn it in seconds or even in a day; but once you get the hang of it start on simple things like pot holders, dishclothes and work your way upthrough leg warmers, socks, sweaters,and  throws, to tailored clothing if that how much expertise you'd like.

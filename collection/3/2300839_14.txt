The purpose of "church" is simply to share time and space with others united in common worship. No matter where you go, there you are, and the Source of All Life, the Eternal One, is there also. Work, peformed to the best of your ability, and in service, is a form of worship, as are art and science. The best prayer is the prayer of action, and self-unfoldment.  Ideally you would visit not only churches, but synagogues, mosques, temples etc to see the universality of human beings longing for connection to the Divine.

This has a lot to do with who is in power in Congress.  In order for Bush to get in the same trouble that Nixon did, the House must first vote to impeach him based on his alleged crimes.  Once the House does this, the Senate must vote him out of office with a 2/3 vote.. . Considering the political makeup of the current Congress, there is little chance that the House will impeach him or that the Senate will find him guilty.

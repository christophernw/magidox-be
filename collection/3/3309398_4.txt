Does any other kind of growth bring happiness?  Simply getting older stops being fun about 21.  Spiritual growth is about understanding the meaning of life, why we are here and where we are going.. When you retire and its time to consolidate your thinking, spiritual growth can accelerate because there are less distractions.  It will always give us healthy challenges and we need those to get out of bed in the morning.

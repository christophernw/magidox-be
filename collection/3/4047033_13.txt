Do about 2 eggs per person.  Crack into a bowl, add a teaspoon of water.  Whisk.  Heat the pan to med/high, use pam or butter, then add eggs and keep moving with a spatula.  Salt and pepper to taste and when eggs are set add some cheese.  . When the eggs are still a bit creamy but well set, remove from heat, they will finish cooking from the heat of the pan.  IF they are brown at all, they are burned.. Good luck!

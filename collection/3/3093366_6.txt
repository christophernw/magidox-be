yes, the evidence is all around us, but Arguing over this point is pointless, its not possible at this time to prove either theory, and if your not referring to evolution vs.God. Evolution is animals,(including us) that have had multiple adaptations over time. Adaptation is changing or adopting a habit that allows it to better live in its habitat. Now we have observed adaptations, so in conclusion, evolution is the next logical idea or step.

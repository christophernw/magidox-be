Excellent question.  It is called the “missionary position”, because this is the position Missionaries use to have sex, and I suspect they know best.  After all, missionaries (known as “God’s little Cassanovas”) have traveled to the far corners of the world to learn about strange and exotic sexual positions from odd and diverse cultures.  Of all this bizarre and arcane research, missionaries can confirm the preferable position is one in which the male, dressed as a Victorian bar maid, is brutally penetrated from the rear by a female dressed as a Mongol Cheiftan.

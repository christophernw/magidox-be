The phytonutrients in fruites and vegtables is the number one thing that I can think of. The protein from fruites and vegtables is also better for your vessles. I could go on and on. If you dont like fruites and vegtables I would recommend a supplement to help you get the phytonutrients. The product is Garden 7. You can find it ast the site below.

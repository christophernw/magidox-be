I don't know for sure, but I read somewhere that people who die young and tragically are angels that have "volunteered" to come to earth just for this mission...to live and die in a certain way...and it IS to teach others or even to show one person the right path.  I am not an overly religious person, but I have had instances in my life that makes me believe in angels, or spiritual guides, whatever you want to call them....it just seems to make sense to me. We all need some sense in our lives and this is mine.

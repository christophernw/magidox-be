Actually I can't find a specific preference for any paintings, cause each of them has a history, a inspiration and an unique value, it just depends of how we get to capture or feel their beauty. It just takes time and attention to learn how to appreciate them. The difference is the technique, but they're really alike, they share the expression of life.

If you are refering to USA, yes. It would make a big difference. . People here would have to learn english, beginning with the president, vicepresident, the congress, business people, ordinary people, journalists, professionals, workers ( like plumbers, carpenters ) , I mean, the whole 220 million people who live in this country, practically none of which actually know english.. I know a graduate from Harvard University, who was hired by the University to find out the development of graduates, and he told me that in a certain corporation, the president told him that the only people who could write a letter in english were his secretary and himself, because not even the vicepresidents knew how to do it

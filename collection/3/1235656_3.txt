Where is the leak? If its from the motor, the water pump is going bad, if its from the radiator, the radiator has a leak. it depends on the temperature where you are located. If its too hot, you should fill with 75 coolant and 25 water- if its cold, use 50/50. . . . PS we had a chevy Calvalier, always had problems- so we sold it.

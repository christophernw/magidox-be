the bible for one and allot of historians from that time and future  Rome wrote every thing down they did and they took a land that was Israel from the Jews back in the day but in seventy ad when the Jew revolted they destroyed the temple and renamed the land Palestine and the Romans wrote all this down which they are so good at doing so that's half of their claim out side the bible but u may say hey they left so they have no claim to it any more it was abandoned but that not true the byzantine empire forced them out even barring them from the holy city it's self Jerusalem   now u may say to your self then why didn't the Jews fight back to get their land back they did fight while under British con troll they ran an underground much like the french did while the Nazis ran France there has been no dispute over weather Israel was ever the Jews land or not it was theirs before and it will be theirs long after in fact the term Jew is slang for the kingdom of Judah that was used by the Romans when they took Israel BTW THE JEWS ONLY HOLD ABOUT AN 8TH OF WHAT ISRAEL USED TO BE

I have had 2 kidney stones and I would rather give birth at least you get something from all of the pain.With both of my kidney stones,I would hurt in my back especially at night when I would try to roll over I felt really heavy on my insides then The pain became so intense I started puking the first one broke up on it's on the second one was so large it had to be surgically removed.

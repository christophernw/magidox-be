Hair is very difficult to remove from an image, the only way you could get it nearly perfect would be to have a very very large and high resolution image, where you can then use the pen tool to go around every single edge of the object. Try to find an image where the hair is not on the edges of the object you want to extract. Then go to the pen tool and zoom waaaay in to the edge, and click which will create an anchor point, then keep going around clicking and dragging anchor points until the entire object is within the path created. Then right click inside the path and click on "Make Selection", then go to your original image and push ctrl+c, or go edit => copy. Then paste into a new document or whereever you want it.. . Photoshop is a program that you just keep learning new things, the more you use it, the better you get with it.

Any person who has enough money to put a ten thousand dollar collar on their cat or dog is far over paid , then to tell the public about it and show all the clothes ( $2,000 ) for a pair of jeans when we have children starving in this country. No I do not support these so called stars at all. I think the parimedic who saves lives all day or nurses who take care of the elderly , I can think of a lot of under paid professionals that deserve more. When you hear about the lavish life of celebs do you feel good about that?

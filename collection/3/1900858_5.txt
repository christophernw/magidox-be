humans are viruses.  Animals are loving as long as you don't poke them at the wrong place.  Humans are cursed with sins upon sins.  We jump around and destroy everything.  People love pets b/c they are needy and clingy.  They can't deal with reality people are loving and hating, it's  what we call living.

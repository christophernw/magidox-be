because the mass of sun is higher than all the other planets ...Moon has a smaller mass compared to earth so it revolves around the earth ...actually it's all 'relative' ...Motion is relative ...if you are driving in the car ...you can say the whole world is moving backwards ....we don't say that ...beacuse of the frame of reference ...we have chosen i.e. "the driver" also the complexity of the motion ....involved when looking at the world the other way....similarly you can say that sun is revolvin the planets but in the frame of reference the motion would be very complex ....so we choose the easier frame of reference ....alo the whole galaxy is rotating ...if you look from the outside frame of reference ..... . . MOTION HAS A DUALITY ....NEVER A SINGULARITY ....

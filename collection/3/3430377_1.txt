Normally with a cold you're going to have some body aches and pains; feel miserable and may have green/yellow mucous.  If you have a sinus infection, you will have almost the same thing.  I'd say that if you experience symptoms daily and they deminish when you take an anti-allergy medication, you do not have a cold.  The cold virus is self-limiting and will only last 5-10 days then it's gone.

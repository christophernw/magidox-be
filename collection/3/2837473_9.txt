Most dogs eat grass at some time.  I have several dogs and they often 'graze' when they come across a particular type of grass.  This type of grass doesn't make them vomit - they just seem to like eating it.. . A couple of them particularly like a plant which grows wild.  I looked it up and discovered that it is very good for the digestion. . . Occasionally, when they are not feeling well they will search around for a specific type of grass that does make them vomit so     they obviously know what they are doing.. . BUT I don't let them eat any leaves because I don't know what are harmful and what are not.  Similarly I let them eat herbs in my garden but I know that many garden plants are harmful so I am careful about what I plant and what they have access to.. . To go back to your question - if your dog doesn't seem to be doing itself any harm by eating grass and it isn't doing it all the time - let it.. . As far as the leaves go you might have to teach your dog not to pick up things or to give them up when you tell him to.t

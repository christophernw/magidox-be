If you have kidney failure, you usually produce little or no urine.  If you take in a lot of fluid, it has no where to go.  Sometimes it goes to the lungs and the person has breathing trouble.  The only way to remove fluid and toxins is dialysis.  They make you restrict the fluid intake so you don't drown in your own fluid before the next dialysis treatment!!!!!!

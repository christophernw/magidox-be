We're all sinners and born sinners. If you don't want to go to hell, all you need is to believe in Jesus that He died for you and rose again in three days. Go to church and be good. You need to be saved so your name will be written once you enter Pearly Gates of Heaven. If your name isn't on there, down the elevator you go to the hottest place in earth, and I mean... in earth.  For those that are saved, although we won't have bodies, we have souls and we live on forever and that's called eternal life.

Just as a geographic landscape is the complete set of geographic features (trees, hills, buildings, etc.) of a place, a cultural landscape is the complete set of cultural features of a specific culture.  Cultural features would include symbols (the American flag, or Ronald McDonald), values (it is better to give than to receive), common lifestyles (live in the suburbs, commute to work) and ideas (the modern western conception of 'vampire' is quite different than the ancient Chinese 'vampire'.)

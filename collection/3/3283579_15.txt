The movie has impacted many people. I believe that the Catholic Church is doing this so they don't lose money and power, but there are other churches who did not agree with this movie. I personally don't agree with this movie the Da Vinci Code. Now people will watch it, and I don't really care. The problem is people really believe this stuff. To many people this is not fiction, and to me this represents a problem not only with the Churches pocket book, but also with the beliefs of the Christian faith. Jesus was said to be completely pure, He was void of earthly lusts. That was why He was the only one Who could die on the cross for our sins. So, you see, if Jesus really had children He would not have been pure enough to die on the cross for our sins.

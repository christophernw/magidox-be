Honestly, we should be looking at the similarities. But for arguments sake, the Catholic Church was founded originally by the Apostles themselves, with a direct line of succession all the way from Peter. THEY ARE CHRISTIANS. The Baptist church was founded in the 17th century in England by reformer John Smyth and he basically disagreed with certain doctrine taught by not only the Catholic Christians but some Protestant churches as well.

well, some cats cannot resist natural leather. mine used to attack and fight with my fur rug - pretending it was an animal. When i brought home a freshly-processed lamb skin to use as a bed spread, tha cat was absolutely beside himself! To give your cat something more attractive than your sofa, i suggest both a scratch pole (from a pet store or just any chunk of wood that you can hang or mount somewhere), preferrably scented with catnip!!! and some treat made of dried unprocessed hide (sold in pet stores for dogs mainly)

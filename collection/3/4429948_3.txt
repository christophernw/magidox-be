Take it to a mechanic unless you are mechanically inclined. Otherwise you have to disconnect the neg. battery cable, loosen the belt tensioner, remove the belt, disconnect the wires on the back of the alternator, label the wires, remove the bolts, and put the new one in in reverse order.  Good Luck!

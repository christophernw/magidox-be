Don't you ever get agitated when someone proves You wrong? I bet you do, but you don't notice it as much, because you're you.. If I have been *proven* wrong, I accept it. But if someone just *says* "You're wrong" with nothing to back it up, I ignore it. You're entitled to your mistakes, and your opinions.. But I can't speak for everyone else out there.

A book is "read"...a book has two sides...2+2 = 4 and 4 x 3 =12.  There are 12 inches in a ruler...Queen Mary was a ruler, and she is also a ship.  Ships go to sea, seas have fish, and fish have fins.  The Fins fought the Russians, and the Russians won.  Fire engines are almost always "rushin' "  That's why fire engines are almost always red.

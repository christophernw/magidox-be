Join a political party, I'd suggest the Green Party with your bio-diesel idea.  Though you had probably better research which party agrees with your sensibilities most.  You had better start small with the city council of your home town and work up through the state senate to Governor.  In thirty years or so, you might have made a name for yourself and could run for president.  If you want to run in 2008, good luck it ain't happening without Bill Gates buying you an early X-Mas present.

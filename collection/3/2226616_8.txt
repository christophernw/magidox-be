Get a small garbage can (the rim reaching over a foot and a half) and place at the bottom food (many like gain, some liked uncooked noodles, some like peanut butter) and place the can where a mouse could jump in (by a table, chair, were wired are. Wait a few days. We caught well over 50 mice (no lie, really) this way!

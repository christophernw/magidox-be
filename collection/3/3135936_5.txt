loll that's funny what you said. i'm pretty sure your IQ is at least above 130. you're smart if you can easily answer their questions, but it's not a real IQ test. I suggest you take a real IQ test like Stanford-Binet if you want to know your actual IQ. Also, online IQ tests aren't realiable because my scores range from 130 to 180.

Thirteen is a very magickal number. Most pagans see it as a lucky number .  most ancients who did not practice folk magick were in awe and fear of the number thirteen. even so in ancient Egypt thirteen was a lucky number and also in china. thirteen is also the number of the moon goddess and a feminine number. when male dominance and a solar calender of twelve appeared many abandoned the number thirteen. of course many think the superstition came from the vikings. A party of the gods was held and one god named Loki was uninvited he would have been the thirteenth person. this angered him so much that he killed the god of joy. thus the vikings came to say t6hat it is unlucky to have thirteen people in a room.

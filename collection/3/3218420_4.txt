Nowadays, people say you're going on a witch hunt if you're looking for accusatory evidence that may not even be there, just to be vindictive, or based on hysteria.  McCarthyism and the black-listing of accused celebrity communists in the 50s was called a witch hunt.  Using people as scapegoats for problems- someone to blame.  Hope my rambling makes sense! : )

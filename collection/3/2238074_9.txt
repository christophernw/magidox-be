WOW-i am so srry!you can tryWhen it comes to the effective removal of cat stains and odors, particularly cat urine, acting immediately is key. Stains that are allowed to dry can be far more difficult to remove and can even require a professional cleaner. Nevertheless, stains and odors from urine, feces, diarrhea, and vomit can be removed with a variety of products and from a variety of surfaces. . . For fresh stains on carpeting, first remove any solid or semi-solid matter such as feces or hairballs. Then use a good carpet shampoo to clean the spot. Follow this with a thorough soaking of club soda which you should allow to sit for ten minutes before blotting dry. For dried or old stains on carpeting, try using a product that contains enzymes, such as Nature's Miracle, and follow the label's instructions. . . For fresh stains on hardwood floors, first wipe off the stain. Next, treat the wood with a commercial cleaning product or a homemade solution using ammonia or vinegar. Stains which have been allowed to dry on hardwood, particularly urine stains, are much harder to remove and usually require significant work. You may need to strip and re-stain the area. . . For stains on clothing, drapes, upholstery covers and the like, wash as usual in the washing machine. However, do not use detergent, but use one cup of vinegar instead. If, however, the material is dry clean only, take it to the dry cleaner. . . Fresh stains on sealed concrete are easily removed by simply wiping the area dry and then cleaning it with a commercial cleaning product or a homemade solution using ammonia or vinegar. If the stain is an old or dry one or if the concrete is unsealed, it'll be harder to remove. First use a commercial cleaning product to neutralize the stain and odor, then seal the concrete. A professional cleaning service may be required if the odor remains.

Instant_Karma is right, and you have to add that in the early 1900's doctors and the public were both ignorant on the true effects of marijuana. It became synonymous with underground culture, poverty, and all the problems of society. They actually had campaign posters saying it made the black men go crazy and gave them super strength when they did so. Complete and utter nonsense, really. Always use responsibly though!

Unfortunately this will not stop overnight.  First try little things, such as saying "no" to things that you normally would say "yes" to.  Once you get used to saying "no" - the rest will just come naturally.. . It's hard - I too had to learn, but once I did - the sky's the limit.. . Good Luck....Have a lovely rest of the day.

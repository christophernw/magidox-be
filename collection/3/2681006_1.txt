Pan German nationalism is the idea that there should be a great German state encompassing all the people who are ethnic German or "Aryan". It is most associated with Adolf Hitler, who made this one of his key policies, calling for anchluss or union with Austria and for the Sudentenland to be handed over to Germany on these grounds.

Its a habit learned in the wild, they slept in hiding,like in grassy fields and had to trample down the grass or weeds before lying down in them. It is an ancestral memory passed from one generation to the next and still present in todays tamed dogs. Dogs used to be wild like people,lol. Well people still are not tamed properly.

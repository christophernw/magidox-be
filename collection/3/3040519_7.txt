there's a few dozen communities that have banned pit bulls because there has been a lot of media hype over people getting killed by pit bulls. the only controlled study on the subject found that only german shepherds and chows are more statistically more likely to bite. However, when a pit bull bites, it is more likely to be fatal. . A lot of this legislation has been based on statistical data from the CDC that breaks down dog bite related fatalities according to the breed of dog. Right now rottweilers and pit bulls are at the top of the list. Statisitics that break up dog bite related fatalities are inaccurate in a lot of ways. They do no account for the percentage of the dog population - popular breeds will obviously show up more than rare ones. Also, they do not take into account the role the owner plays. Because of their reputations, pit bulls are often selected by people who want a mean dog. You can make a golden retriever mean if you want to, but you wouldn't get one if you wanted to. So pit bulls end up being more likely to be mean b/c they are more likely to be purchased by idiots. I posted a list of resources over in the page about rottie v. pit bull, if you would like to look at that.

okay, i have a story!. . I live in a capital city in the south and go to a public school. I have bible studies at lunch every day possible.. how do i do this? my best friends mom asked an interesting group of questions to clessify if my Bible study was right.. . Are you allowed to read at lunch? Yes. Are you allowed to talk at lunch? Yes.                  FINALLY. Are you allowed to discuss what you read at lunch? YES!. . I think america is falling apart from the God we were built on, though as long as there is at least one christian holding us up with the help of God, we can pull it off.

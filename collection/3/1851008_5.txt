We can do this by not paying attention.Racism is . history...It will fade.Look at a child ,children do not know of history or hate.The problem stems from all sides in defense or pro.."The give me because . Its all"I am not liked so give to me"Its all The "give me because I am liked so give to me"It all has to cease...The children are listening... Fortunately as children ,they have short attention spans.Unlike history ,which will be as such .If left to rest.I see life out my eyes .Not exactly my brain.iTS ALL STILL ABOUT GREED and "GIVE ME CAUSE I AINT TOO HAPPY AND ITS YOUR FAULT OR GIVE ME I AM YOUR OWN!. This  all hcomes in all colors ...is it really our battle.The little guy..Now we get along fine..Heck let the elbows wish to rub elbows rub in their own stoopid war.And visa whichever..Regardless of what we may think all is just a sponge on the subject.. A clinger..using it as an excuse for their own . dissatisfaction.I will leave it as that.

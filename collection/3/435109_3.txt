Might I suggest you misunderstand US policy.  BushCo is not in Iraq to prevent disorder.  They are there to preserve it.  All this "talk" about Terror, is smoke for distraction, while Bush and Halliburton sack Iraq and the US Treasury.  Most of the world understands that Bush is the most dangerous man in the world.  His invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq is the most significant act of terrorism in the world today.  He did not do this to stop conflict.  He wants the conflict to spread.  Iran is next on his list, and I'm sure he has some design on Syria as well.  We can only hope he is somehow stopped before he has us all in a worldwide conflagration right out of the Armageddon Myth.

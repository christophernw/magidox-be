For looks ya gotta go with a blinged out maroon escalade.  They are the mountain top of style.  They look great, ride high (or low if you want) and people turn their heads when they drive by (even stock).  The H2 is a close second for pimpness value.  It's quite simply a different looking car that turns heads.. . On the other hand these things eat gas like John Candy and Chris Farley (if they were alive) at Ryan's buffet.  In that case since I like to be eco-conscious any SUV with a hyrbrid engine is my favorite like the Ford Escape Hybrid.

There is no reason to disbelieve Diebold's statement that it was not in the business in 2000 since that is easily checked and there would be little point in misrepresenting it.  However, I am not pleased with the lack of trackability of electronic voting.  I urge that all the machines have printers attached (printers are dirt cheap these days) which would print out a paper ballot with the voter's selections marked.  These would be clearly readable and unambiguous, and the voter could verify the selection and deposit the ballot in a box. In the event of any question, the paper ballots could be counted and the tally compared against the electronic total.  The State of Washington is moving toward doing this.

Dear. When you are moving out of your car you are charged with static current due to friction between your clothes and car chair and due to your shoes which not allowing this charges to go out to the ground you keep those charges till you touch any metal so it can go out....SOLUTION..during getting out of the car keep your hand holding the metal part of the car door so as you are charged you are evacuating at the same time to car body  or  when you get out of the car hold the metal car kee and touch the car body with it you will see the spark coming out  or  use shoes with antistatic character help you to evacuate the charge to the ground when you touch it...This condition is very famous in countries with dry weather and low humedity....GOOD LUCK

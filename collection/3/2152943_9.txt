Probably not much. Taking my kids over to my uncles because my mom asked me to spend Thanksgiving with them. But I am sure we will not be there all day since me and my uncle do not see eye to eye and he has problems with racism. Other then that nothing.... Hoping everyone has a great and safe Thanksgiving!!!

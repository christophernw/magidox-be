Beats me! Last I heard transalting any document or song is totally legal.. . It's like saying we should all pray in Aramaic cause that's the original Biblical language.. . By the way I'm Hispanic and I don't see what the big deal is.  For all those posters that say Hispanics should learn to speak English, that's like the pot calling the kettle black.  Some American's in the rural South need a good lesson in proper English. Stop being racists it just proves how ignorant you were raised.

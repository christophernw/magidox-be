what my art teacher has us do is..... make a graph of squares(clear). i don't know how big the picture is, u have 2 figure that out. make it that it fits your picture. tape it down so it won't move. that way u can concentrate on each little section of the picture. the con is.... u have 2 make sure it isn't off a  little in 1 square or your whole picture is off.

the 'dark' puts many people on edge, making their senses  much more  aware at night, thus able to see the spirits that are there.  ghosts are around 24/7, not only at night.  it is a misconception that they only appear at night.  many of the ones that I have seen and been involved with have all appeared during daylight hours.. their not being found on videos and film is only evidence that cameras and the like cannot pick them up, not that the ghost is not there.

I think some people are either highly devoted to the Lord, are lost for words and believe prayer is the only solution, or either are just cynical and think "hey they believe in God they will pick my answer b/c I mentioned him." I will sometimes say God Bless at the end, and I do mention prayer on occasions, but I'm NOT going to force religion, domination, or anything pertaining to on anyone it's NOT right. You can simply tell them you will pray for them and nothing more. I don't believe that if you try to force something upon someone it's going to change their point of views.

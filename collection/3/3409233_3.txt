As far as I'm aware, no one is sure what exactly purring does for a cat. It has been long noted that cats purr when they are happy and content. They also purr when they are in pain. For instance, a mother cat having kittens will purr while she is in labor. Whether this is to comfort the kittens during the stress of being born or to calm herself, we don't know. Mother cats do purr to comfort their kittens.

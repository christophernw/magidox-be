Here is are a few reasons why people SHOULD have guns. For one thing, society. In order to get a gun, you need a registered license. This ensures that MOST of the people carrying guns are registered to use them. Lets face it, in today's society, people have more money than others. People who don't have as much resort to crime to get what they want. Someone will use a gun to threaten and or kill people for what they want. . . People use knifes for the same purpose, but you don't see them trying to be outlawed. You see people who drive wrecklessly and hit others in their attempt to escape the police, but you don't hear about cars trying to be outlawed. The fact remains, if you outlaw guns, people will still get them from other countries. By making them legal, you are ensuring people's safety who need them. You need some protection in this world because no matter what laws you have, someone will always be there to break them. You might as well be prepared for WHEN it happens.

The practice of celibacy didn't start with the first generation of Christian leaders like Peter and Paul.  During the earliest days of the Catholic church, there were many married priests.  The problem was that many of their wives went all 'Yoko Ono' on them, for lack of a better analogy. The priests were being controlled by politically and socially ambitious women, leading to major problems within the church.. . The solution was to enforce a vow of celibacy, for several reasons.  One was to eliminate the possibility of wives ever influencing church doctrine again, and the other was to encourage a lifestyle removed from the basest drives like sex and greed.  Priests who convert to Catholicism from other denominations can remain married.. . Becoming a eunuch would be overkill.  It's not that God decreed that sexual desire itself is wrong, but a priest should work harder to overcome it than the general population.  There are many people in this world who don't engage in sexual activity for a number of non-religious reasons.  No one would seriously suggest that all celibate people have their genitals removed because of them.

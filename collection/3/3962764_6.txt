How old, and is she any particular breed?  Do you know how she was raised?  These things can make a difference in the behavior of your feline.. . My cat is wonderful, and very loving, but she does not like to play with toys that much either.  I do not think it is anything you should be concerned about, as long as you know that she is happy and healthy.. . Does she like you to carry her around with her in your arms?  Some cats really like this, but others do not.

Aw, come on. I am African American and the Confederate Flag doesn't represent anything about racism. It is a symbol of the south. It is just a piece of cloth that represents the rebellion that lead to the Civil War. It isn't about racism. The Civil War was not about racism. The Civil War was about succession from the Union. . . Whenever the Confederate flag gets flown, it is symbolic of the unity of the South. Which is a bogus theory. The South is no more unified now than it was during the Civil War. The south no longer exports its' racism or it's history with slavery, but it exports its' stupidity and backwards values.. . The Confederate flag represents nothing except a reminder that the south does everything bassackwards and they are proud of it.

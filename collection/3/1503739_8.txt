Any priest of the Church of the Subgenius can probaly perform a reverse-baptism.. . So, your options are to either find an ordained priest of the Church of the Subgenius (That would be me) and ask him/her to reverse-baptise you (feel free to ask me, I think there's a message thing in this site).. . Or, you can just become and ordained priest of the Church of the Subgenius.. . I'm not aware of any other religions that offer such services.

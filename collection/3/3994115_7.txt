DOGS HAVE A MUCH MORE ACCUTE SENSE OF HEARING THAN WE HUMANS DO. WHAT IS LOUD TO US CAN BE EXCEPTIONALLY LOUD TO THEM. THEY ARE PROBABLY TRYING TO LISTEN AND JUST LIKE WE DO WHEN WE ARE TRING TO LISTEN INTENTLY WE TURN AN EAR TOWARDS THE SOUND TO BE BETTER ABLED TO HEAR EACH NUONCE.. DONT FORGET THEIR SENCES ARE MORE HIGHLY ATTUNDED THAN OURS SO DONT HAVE YOUR MSUIC TOO LOUD AROUND YOUR PET.

To me (a self-proclaimed red-neck, although a yankee born and bred)  the confederate flag is the symbol of people who were willing to fight and die for what they believed in.  At the time, they fought to protect their livelihood and their way of life.  It may not have been right, but at the time, that was all they knew.. . If people didn't take a chance or go out on a limb to fight for what they believe in, the history of the world would be way different than what we know.  If people didn't fight religious persecution, the US would never have been founded.  At least not the way we know it.  If we hadn't fought the British, the US would now be a British colony and we would all drink tea instead of coffee.  What if women hadn't fought for equal rights?  . .  There is a need for people to stand up for what they believe is right.  Even if they are judges to be wrong.. . Why would you get scared?  Has anyone ever threatened you with a flag?  If you are scared of what you view as racism?  Ignorance?  Racism and ignorance carry no flag.  They waves no banner.  There is no warning.  Racism and ignorance can hide in the most surprising of places and pop out when you least expect it.

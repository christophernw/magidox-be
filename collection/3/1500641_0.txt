Assuming your music files can be obtain online (i.e through downloads from the internet, or from iTunes Music Store), otherwise you could always borrow a friend's computer which does have a CD-ROM drive and transfer your music files into iTunes Library.. . Another way is to use GMail's (from Google) immense online storage space to upload your files into your own inbox and download them from your laptop. However, the limitation is that you are only allowed a maximum upload of 1GB worth of data per day before being cut off (daily upload capacity limit).

Most common misconception is that she was burned as a witch.  She wasn't.  She had visions and they went against what the Church thought was best.  She was tortured, supposedly raped while in prison, and then burned as a Heretic (one who openly opposes the Catholic Church - which, she did do).  After some years of study, the Catholic Church decided it was wrong to do that, said they were sorry and made her a Saint.. . And I would love to see prove that she was under "Satan's Influence".  People just love saying stuff like that. lol  If it wasn't for her, that particular war may have went the other way.......

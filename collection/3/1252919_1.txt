Except for people who drive into a brick wall at 100 mph or have similarly rapid demises from catastrophic failure of a vital organ such as the heart, people die slowly.. . About 8 out of 10 people die slowly.  Many people walking about are variously 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 even 30% dead alrady.. . Once you acquire medical experience you will see that is the way it works.  Above 30% dead things start working faster to accelerate the process, as all systems and organs in the body are dependent upon one another.  . . With experience, you can actually spot people who will die within a day, or within a week.. . So, for 8 out of 10 people there is no such thing as 'dying all at once.'. . The most prominent among the 1 in 10 who do die all at once are reckless teenagers and young people.  The chief cause is drunk or careless driving not in accord with legal speed or road conditions.. . Aging is partial death well underway, though the percentage is far below 30% dead in most cases.  Systems and organs are starting to wear out, function more slowly and with consierably less vigor.. . Proper exercise, diet and mental attitudes are truly effective factors in slowing the aging process.. . Life on earth tends to kill most people sooner or later, from the effects of aging if not war, crime, accident.. . If people were less cruel and more caring life would be marvelously enhanced.  As civilization proceeds slowly into better eras of ethics and education, people will have much longer lives, even ranging up to 300--500 years in length in the future.. . These are all things I know for absolute sure from comprehensive and long experience with both medical and religious work and studies.. . If you doubt any part of it, ask a medical professional who has more than 25 years of actual experience.

Poor circulation can lead to heart disease and stroke as well as many other complications.. There are many reasons for poor circulation as well and I would recommend having a Doctor rule out the major things like heart problems.. I do know of a product that will improve your circulation as well as your general health.  It is an adaptogen which goes to work on auto-immune deficiencies.. This is the only functional juice on the market with medical validation including 72 clinical studies published at pubmed.org.. This product has been very effective for diabetics who are known to have poor circulation.  As an example, a diabetic roommate of mine was having such a hard time balancing his blood sugar that his feet were starting to turn black and purple and he had a lot of swelling.  After 3 weeks of taking this juice, the color is starting to return to his feet, they are turning pink and the swelling has disappeared.. Another person I know who has icy hands and feet, even in the summer time, has tried this juice with similar results.  After 1 week she noticed a huge improvement and has also said she is now sleeping better as well.. Please contact me for more information.

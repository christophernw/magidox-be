I'm not sure there is much of a difference. Coating provides color and a way to write on the pill. They used to sugar coat tablets to taste better but asparin is usually swallowed.. . From wikipedia, the only functional use of coating tablets is to coat them so that they will disolve in the small intestine, where they are supposed to be used. I don't believe this applies to asprin either though.

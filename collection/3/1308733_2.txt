Most of the worker bees die. The queen and a few attendents go into hibernation.. . ""For about ten months out of the year, that bee does nothing but sit fully fed as a larva in the ground. It's active for, at most, two months. Partly as an adult and partly as a feeding, immature stage, but for the rest of the year it's hibernating and estivating. Estivating meaning spending the dry part of the year doing nothing."

Relax,the child was not ready to be born.The baby chose you because it knew it would be aborted.The soul involved was not quite ready for a full experience in physical reality,it only wanted a sample.If you had not made your decision,it would have chosen miscarriage.I do not condone abortion,but I do not condemn it either.You are not going to hell,but don't forget the sacredness of Life.

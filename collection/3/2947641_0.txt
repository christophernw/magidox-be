ANOVA stands for ANalysis Of VAriance, and measures the difference between groups of data. An ANOVA compares the mean values of multiple groups and gives an estimate of how likely it is that the results you have could be the result of chance. An ANOVA is usually calculated using a computer, with statistical software such as SPSS or a basic computational program such as Microsoft Excel. Calculations by hand are long and painful, and I am unfamiliar with any situation in which that would be expected.

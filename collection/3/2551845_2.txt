Because capturing the head of the terrorist organizations is the LEAST he could be doing, not a "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED" event.  Bush even has the sense to qualify it as not having much effect on terrorist actions.. . Why do you Bush supporters keep your heads in the sand on how things are going in Iraq and only come out to cheer these little steps like they were the end of the war?

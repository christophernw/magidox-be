II think it works the same as in regular Outlook: on the toolbar, click on "Tools" and scroll down to the "Out of Office Assistant."  A dialog box will pop up where you can enter the message you want people to see when they receive your Out-of-Office message.  (Note: you can set up this message ahead of time; Outlook saves it under the assumption that it's the same message you want to use every time you go on a trip or something, so you don't have to type it in every time)  The bottom half of the dialog box is where you can select rules for message handling: you can set Outlook to forward all your messages to another email address or save important email that you're waiting for but won't be around to read into a specific folder that you designate.  When you're ready to go on your business trip or whatever, you open up the Out Of Office Assistant again and click on the check box next to "I am out of the office" and the program will take it from there.  Just remember to click on "I am in my office" when you return; otherwise, people will still get your message and think you're on your trip.

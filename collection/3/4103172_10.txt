I feel that the child loses it after awhile.. Teachers, can teach but the child can be a slow learner. I know I was. So the teacher asks does everyone get this embarassed they do not answer, and like myself we get lost, and loss of interest occurs. and then they drop out.  I tell my grandchildren that if they do not get it they must'nt leave school until they do and confide in the teacher and get the instruction after school so that they do not fall behind..

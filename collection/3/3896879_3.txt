Depends on your state. In california you have to go to either DMV, or the Highway Patrol to get a blue tag. I own a nissan skyline here in the states and for me to have it here, I had to get it blue tagged because it has no identification.. . If you own the car and have no title, you can get one from your DMV or the county clerks office. You will pay a small fee but that is better then getting pulled over and getting arrested. . . Now, if the car can be donated, you can donate it for a tax deduction in most states. Either it applies to your state tax or you fed tax. I would suggest calling one of those churches and tell them about it and see what they can do. They will come and tow the car for free. It's all charity.

Use the fresh French Beans Haricot Vert.  They are thinner and will cook faster.  They won't be "green" tasting.  Chop bacon and cook until brown.  Drain the oil off.  Using the same pan, do not rinse the bacon grease out and add a little olive oil and garlic.  Slightly cook the garlic and then add the green beans and toss together coating the beans with the mixture.  Cover the beans and cook about 10 minutes.  Add bacon right before serving.  Yummy!!!

If your a believer in Jesus, admit to Him what your in denial about and ask for forgiveness. I tell you He already knows but He wants to hear it out loud from you. Than have peace about this. Than go and tell a believer whom you trust what you are in denial about too, an ask this person to be a prayer partner will you, this is a process, you must learn a new way to deal with what life brings, and ones past. There is freedom in ones soul without denial.. . been there!

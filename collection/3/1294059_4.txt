To find one radian, you find the length of the radius, and take that length along the circumference of the circle. The two radii connecting that length around the circumference form one radian (an angle measurement). There are 2 Pi radians in a Circle. Since there are 2 Pi in a circle, one Pi is equal to half of a circle. Since a pie is a circle, one half of the pie would be 1 Pi. . . I think the best idea would be simply to bring half a pie, or, to illustrate on the pie in whipped cream or something of the sort. You could ouline half the circle of the pie, and a line straight through, or you could even draw each radian seperately. There are approx. 3.14 radians in 1/2 a circle. I'm sure if you look online you'll be able to find some illustrations of where those lines would be.. Good luck!

You can either buy some nail glue or you can also buy some of the press on nails or go to a salon and have your nails done.  As soon as you get the nail covered and you have gel or acrylic put over the nail you won't even feel the nail.  If you don't want to keep the nails on,  just leave them on until your nail grows out.

I would wait a little, at least.. . I lost a female gold mantled rosella 3 years ago who I adored.   Her mate was so distraught that I replaced the bird within a few days for his sake.  Otherwise, I would probably have lost him too.     I felt I had no choice in the matter.   However, for a few months, I resented the new bird.   Every time I looked at her in the other bird's aviary, eating her food, playing with her toys I hated her.    I have this bird 3 years now and she is the most adorable bird I could have.    I felt so guilty for my feelings after wards.   At the time I wasn't ready for her.   I think you need to give yourself time for your grief.   Then, when you are ready to love another bird, get one.   This bird will not be the bird you lost and you must be ready to love it for itself.

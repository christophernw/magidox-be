Colchicine is a very old medicine that has been used since the first century to treat gout.  It is an alkaloid derived from members of the genus Colchicum.  It is still approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute gouty arthritis, and is still sometimes prescribed for that purpose.  Because of its side effects and risk of toxicity, colchicine has been largely replaced by safer, more effective anti-inflammatory agents such as Motrin, Naproxyn, or (in severe cases) prednisone.  Nowadays most attacks of gouty arthritis can be prevented with adequate doses of allopurinol, a drug which reduces the level of uric acid in the blood of persons who tend to hyperuricemia and high risk of attacks of gout.

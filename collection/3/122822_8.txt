If we have a real relationship with him,we can experience his presence all the time.. not only through worshiping & praying ,but in everything we do we can feel his joyful presence & peace within our hearts and experience his blessings even during playing,eating...ect. [for in him we live and move and are]acts 17:28. Note: u say[ God's power is so infinite]and yes it is,but since our bodies are so limited ,we experience his power in a limited way so that our bodies can stand it.God Bless.

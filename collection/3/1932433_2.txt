scientists know that the Earth is made of layers because:. When Earths plates shift there is a new layer of Earth that appears and the old layers get pushed back into the Earth under the ocean, it's called seafloor spreading, you can search it up. So there must be some kind of material underneath the Earths surface. When a volcano erupts lava comes out and when lava cools it solidifies and when it does it hardens like the Earth's surface. This also proves that the Earths core is extremely hot. When an undersea volcano erupts it forms a new layer of the Earth. Then the old layers get "recycled" back into the Earth and is reheated to make a liquidy substance that has a high viscosity (that means it's very thick). That's what I know I hope what I explained will help you.

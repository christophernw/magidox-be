In Nevada, or parts of it, prositiution is legal.  And, there are taxes on it, there are laws governing it, and all that jazz.. . While, legalizing prostitution everywhere does have benefits of tax income, health controls, and some public oversight there are still negatives.. . First, it makes it easier to get prostitutes.  This may seem like an ok thing but it puts forth an easier means for people to cheat.  Have mass prostitution illegal does put some protections in place to protect people from themsleves, drunk decisions, and the people they care about. Then there is also the culture around prostitution.  It is not one of self esteem and is very hard for the girls involved.  To promote that culture, attitude, and lifestyle on women is really damaging in many ways.

The reason "to be" is to search for happiness and pleasure.  Granted, we have to go to dreary jobs, put up with lousy drivers, annoying friends, judgemental family.  But, the beauty of life is that at some point something truly wonderful could happen.. . So, to be is to open oneself to the possibility of rainbows and cake.  To be is to give yourself the chance to pursue laughter and tenderness.. . That is why we choose to be -- because with each new day there's fresh hope.

The right partner is the one who enhances who you are, by making you want to be better, while not changing you at all.. . I believe there are several right people out there for everyone, however finding one of those right people who you can live with but could not imagine living without is really what I feel a soulmate is. I believe in both of these (right person and soulmate) because I believe I have found her... sure, just like anyone else she does the wrong thing every so often, but it isn't worth an argument when compared to the millions of right things she does! :-D

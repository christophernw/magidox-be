Who says they do? Alcoolism is as much genetic as anything else. Women DO absorb it faster then men and maybe they may feel more of an emotional need to escape into the bottle but just because they're women doesn't men their more prone to becoming alcoholics then men. This is more of a case by case basis because each person's circumstance is different.. . . Vin

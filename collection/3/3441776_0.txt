If you were to look at the answers based on the atomic clock, then you would think there would be no definition for a second before these atomic clocks were invented or the radiation from Cesium atoms was discovered.. . The actual definition of a second is 1/(24*60*60) part of a day.  A day is the time it takes for the earth to complete  one revolution on its axis.  Before the more precise atomic measurement, astronomical observatories were used to measure the exact length of a day to establish the value of the second.

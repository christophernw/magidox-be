I have known persons to pray for years. I believe that when the person does except Jesus you will keep on praying for them. When a person goes all the way for the lord they will need your prayer and support. so keep on praying for the person. I have prayed for my daughters to be saved for years and I keep on and now I thank the lord everyday for there souls to be saved. I hope I have made some since.

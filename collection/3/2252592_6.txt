It's extremely hard to avoid someone especially in the workplace.  If I were you, the next time you run into that person or they start a conversation with you, I'd give them the cold shoulder or not answer them in such a friendly tone.  For example, if they say to you "Could you get that for me?", just say "Ok." and walk away.  They'll get the message that the way they've been treating you is not going to sit well with you and if they don't change their attitude, you won't change yours.

People drop out of high school for many reason.  As a high school student, I see that school can be stressful.  I have a firends that stay up all night doing homework.  While stress is one factor, the major problem is peer pressure, family, and outside involvement.  Peers are suppose to be helpful.   While most are helpful, so are really evil and force people to do drugs and make you do crimes that you don;t want to.  Family is a big factor if they are poor.  It would make the student want to work to support the family.  Some student just want to be out in the community and don;t want to be at school

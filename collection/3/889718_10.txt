I also use runes of the elder futhark.  But the runes are for more than just divination, they are a complete magical system.  Invoking the power of the rune by chanting or singing it's phonetic sound yeild great results in spellwork.  The reason I use the runes is because I am a practicing Germanic Heathen. They are in the cultural context to my practice.  The runes are in alignment with my study of my ancestory, and the magical path i have found myself on. As well as my natural predisposition to it as a form of magic. My patrons are Odin/Loki (brothers are never far apart)& Hella & Berkana, although I do have a particular fascination with the Vanir gods as well, believe it or not Frey has actually tried to get me in more trouble than Loki.  I am a sucker for trouble...  If you haven't already i recommoend you read the poetic edda particularly the Havamal (or the saying's of Har)especially stanza's 138-165 they deal specifically with the runes.  this poem is available on many websites here are a few translations. . http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/havamal.html. http://www.ragweedforge.com/havamal.html. http://www.simnet.is/gardarj/havamal.htm. http://asatru.org/havamal.html. .

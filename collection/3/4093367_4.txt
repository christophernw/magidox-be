Well if you need migration advice all you need to do is TLAM - that is think like a mexican, just sneak into their country, demand free healthcare, welfare, never pay taxes, walk around carrying the romanian flag - every though it seems you can speak both french and english I would suggest jumping on your head a few times to forget that stuff and just speak romanian? and then demand that Canada hires someone to translate everything for you - a little personal canadian assistant - it has worked for the wetbacks it can work for you...

In psychology, apprehension (Lat. ad, "to"; prehendere, "to seize") is a term applied to a model of consciousness in which nothing is affirmed or denied of the object in question, but the mind is merely aware of ("seizes") it.. . In logic, the comprehension of an object is the totality of intensions, that is, properties or qualities, that it possesses.

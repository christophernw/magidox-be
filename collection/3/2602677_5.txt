Life may feel difficult because it is full of challenges and tests. Each event you encounter and how it is handled will result in something else happening. This is why one must think before they act, consider the consequences. One way to make life a little less difficult is treat others with kindness and respect. This in turn will (hopefully) lead to others treating you with the same. Each phase of a persons life always brings about another challenge. And since everyone is different, each has a different experience from the same event. Just take it day by day and if you have a good heart you may just meet lifes challenges and tackle them with ease.

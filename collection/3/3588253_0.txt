I agree with you.  Immigrants often live in heavily immigrant neighborhoods where they can get by without learning English.  However, all of my ancestors came from non-English speaking countries and learned English as soon as they arrived here -- that's the idea behind the melting pot.  If immigrants don't want to learn English they should move back to where they came from.

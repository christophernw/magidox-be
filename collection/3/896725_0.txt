crunches, side crunches where you're targeting your obliques (do regular crunch with both your legs turned to one side then the other), and when i started kick boxing i was introduced to an exercise that really helped my love handles.. lie on your side with your upper body on the floor, not propped up. put your top hand behind you head and lift your top leg and bring your upper body up to meet it.. repeat reps and switch sides.. . i hope i described this well..be sure to try to modify it to work your sides in case what i described isn't hitting the mark....if you keep up with it..i promise you will feel the muscles tightening!

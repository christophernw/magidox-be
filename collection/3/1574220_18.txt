Because they are trying to get around the word "ILLEGAL".  Native Americans used to be incharge of the U.S.  Who cares!  This is now and that was then.  Hell, even the natives themselves were divided so you wouldn't even be able to give back the entire U.S. to all of the Native Americans but only a certain portion to specific tribes.  And those tribes themselves killed each other and took over each others land. So who is to decide?  This  is the present so people need to stop BSing.  And whoever said the Spaniards assimilated with the Aztecs, who cares.  The Aztecs where in Mexico so maybe all of the illegal Mexicans should stay there if you keep trying to use that stupid argument.  You say the "rednecks" took over the U.S. so what the hell makes you think it would be okay for you to try and do the same.  Half of the people posting here must be little fifth graders from what I'm reading, geez.  I usually try to be civil but people are starting to get annoying.

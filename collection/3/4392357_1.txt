Well if you want to try to explain the pronunciation with a y in there then you would need to spell it out like.... . H-you-ston    - But that really isnt correct.  Hugh-ston is most correct, but often the H becomes nearly non-existant due to local dialect so sometimes it comes out closer to You-ston. (which may be where you are getting the Y sound.). . OU is one of those letter combinations that can sound many different ways, I believe partly based on what other language the word was derived from, especially in the case of people's names.. . Sound for instance is an ow sound like cow.. Soup however has a very differnet sound more like Loop.. Could again has a much different sound to it.. . As for NYC's Houston St. it is pronounced "House-ton" because it's named after a man named "House-ton." Houston TX is pronounced "Hugh-ston" because it's named after Sam "Hugh-ston."   That's just the way these people pronounced their names.

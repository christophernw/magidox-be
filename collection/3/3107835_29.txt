I think it's a warning to what they can't see. . They also enjoy wartching T.V., and biting the guy who owns the business next door who is abusive to his girlfriend.. A well deserved bite I would say. He would never call the police, since he is etch a sketchin, tweeking, what ever you call it. Dogs sense evil..  Sleep in the daytime, guard at night. Wonder how Snoop Dog got his name. hehe

If english we mandated by law as the official language then we could certainly save money on government documents printed in other languages, we could save on govt. employee saleries by not having to pay extra money to someone because they are bi-lingual. . . We could save on phone bills like when the 911 operator answers and you don't speak english she could just hang up and save on the phone bill.

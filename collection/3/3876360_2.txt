need more info does the remote work on your central locking as this is all part of your immobiliser if so make sure you get in the car shut the door press the lock button and then the unlock button then try to start car if there is fuel getting up to the fuel rail then it should start if not then either you have no spark or the fuel pump could be faulty if no fuel and no spark the probably immobiliser fault main dealer fix I'm afraid if it won't turn over at all and the battery has been changed the it;s probably the starter motor try bump starting if it goes then starter fault or if you can push start it try putting lights on and turning the key if it clicks but lights don't dim then definitely starter motor hope this helps

by having different ethinicities and cultures gather as one. maybe have kids get to know each other's culture, background, and so forth. then there is talking to the principal which could arrange something to brong the kids together or listen to the suggestions made by the students. maybe habe a culture week at school which the principal may agree upon if asked and so forth. kids learning about others and where other kids come from, their background, ethinicity as well as culture is really important...

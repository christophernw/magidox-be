Some circuit preachers hold up their Bible when quoting it and "thump" (tap) it with the other hand for emphasis.  Or when reading from it they will do the same.  It's a bit showy, so it's used for Christians who are very adament about their faith.  It's not really very polite to call someone a bible thumper.

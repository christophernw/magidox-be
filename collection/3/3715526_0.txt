Yep, I did something similar years ago.. . I saw a doctor who told me to avoid sitting for six months and that is what I did.  I didn't sit at the table for meals, I avoided any car rides of more than fifteen minutes or so, and in general I just didn't sit.  Sometimes it was embarrassing, like at conferences when I'd stand instead of sit in the chair, but it did pay off.. Good luck to  you.

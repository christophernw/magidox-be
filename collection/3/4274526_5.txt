you and your desendants are gulty of being here illegally and they have many henious crimes they comitted along the way and I have'nt heard of any one asking you to leave yet... Mexicans are indigenious to the lands of the united states and were discrimating against them, thats just not right and we need to admit when were wrong and make it right and hope god forgives our tresspasses and crimes we have comitted against native people .. this land is there birth right and mexicans, american indian and hawaiians are more intitled to this land than anyone else on earth.. They dont need to get in line they should be in the front of the line over any other immigrants entering this country.. After all they are willing to live in peace with you.

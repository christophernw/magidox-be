what you need to do is go to your local car accessories shop, they sell small square double sided sticky pads but before you try and stick the mirror back on usea a solvent i.e. petrol or thinners to clean both the mirror and the glass where you are sticking the mirror to, the old glue left there breaks down the strength of the glue on the pads. then sinply stick the mirror in place

Certain people run more than one business or accounts with each card. I have a card for debit to my checking account a card i use for on-line purchase only (or for ordering goods through catalogs), a visa for office use supplies airplane tickets computers business lunches, bar tabs all for tax reasons and lastly an amex for every day purchases so I don't have to carry around large sums of cash and most people take it that I do business with so I eliminate the need for anything more than $20 in cash n my wallet, at the end of the month  can pay it off with a check and I have instant copies of my transactions for tax purposes plus if I have a problem with a purchase they will do a charge back faster than any other company.

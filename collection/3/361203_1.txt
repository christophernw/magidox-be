First, in response to a previous answerer, I believe the questioner's name indicates that he or she is an Apache Indian, so he has the wrong continent.  Second, to the questioner, please show me one nation whose government is not significantly flawed.  The best I've come to expect is to at least not get hosed too badly.  Furthermore, I'm not entirely sure that a lack of political experience is always a bad thing.  Sometimes, fresh perspectives are needed, and as long as they have the experience to fulfill the duties of their job and I can reasonably expect that they'll be able to do their jobs in a competent manner, I'll be willing to at least consider voting for them.  The founders of the United States envisioned a nation where people would serve their country and then head back to their business.  Perhaps if we saw more of that instead of seeing second and third generation career politicians, our nation would be in better shape.

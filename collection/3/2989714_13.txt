They're not jealous. But a LOT of black men go out of their way to get a WHITE woman, when it shouldn't matter what color she is! And yes, lots of black men date white girls for an ego boost for themselves like they have a vanilla trophy. (That is the truth - it's not ignorant.) I think lots of people get mad because dating a woman just because she's white is wrong, too.

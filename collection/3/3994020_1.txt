Motivation. You have to sit, inhale and exhale a few times, close your eyes and then think about the things that you love to do. I doesn't matter that those were things that you like long time ago. Then make a list, everything that comes to you like playing some sport, reading some kind of book, hanging around in some place, anything you remember you like to do. And then try to do those as soon as you can. By the other hand with the main thing that has you into depression also close you eyes and make a big wall paper on all the bad things that it made you pass trough. And everytome that you feel like you want to come back in to depression by that thing, put that big wall paper with all the bad things, and It will make you forget it.

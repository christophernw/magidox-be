Laughing Out Loud! Actually, in the English language I don't know how to say "carcajearse" a word that means laughing histerically loud, I don't have a clue about the real word. Carcajearse is a cool Spanish word, I think. When one laughs with all his heart, he is not just smiling, he is almost throwing himself in the floor out of laughter.

Yes and no... I am not ready to go and I don't want to miss my kids growing up.  No, because I understand it will happen one day to all of us.  Yes.. I never want to bury one of my own.. The law of parents is we go first not them.  . My heart would break and don't know if I would ever recover.. So ... yes and no.

Is your cat an indoor cat, you obviously don't love your cat very much, if this was your child you would automatically know what to do. DIET, DIET, DIET. This involves giving your cat less food at EVERY meal and stop leaving food in the bowl all day. Cats do not naturally feed all day.  It is ok to not feed your cat for one meal a week. Try feeding your cat from a yellow bowl.  Yellow is known to loose weight, however this does depend on how fat your cat is, it may take some time. Good luck.

I do not know what the reason would be of not installing parachutes on airplane seats; however, I believe that you have a great question here and a few good reasons down below.. The idea of 'ejectable parachute seats' may have some merit; however, the cost to the airline industry may be forbidding.  If this could be achieved all commercial air liners would have to be redesigned in order that the seats and the passenger would 'eject' spontaneously and safely out of the bottom of the aircraft. The idea may seem far fetched but in my opinion may be a solution to tragic deaths that may be avoided by the proper applications to airline transportation systems.  Jose

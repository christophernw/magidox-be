I've been there (once) and the guys wore button-ups and a few had on jeans but no sneakers. I'm not sure about Tims, but my girl's guyfriend wore steel-toed black leather boots, so why not Timberlands?. . As far as drinks being free, I have no idea and I seriously doubt it. Our drinks sure as hell weren't free that night.

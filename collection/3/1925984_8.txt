Thats because people are spending instead. The reason they are spending is because of increased borrowing thanks to still existant low interest rates. Interest rates are low because the money supply is relatively large thanks to the FED's sales of treasury bonds, a monetary policy which allows us to stimulate economic growth by expanding our money supply and therefore offer low interest rates. Our large money supply has also contributed to the devaluation of the dollar (along with some inflation and an ever increasing trade defecit), encouraging foreign countries (especially China) to buy more treasury bonds from the FED, therefore floating us the money to further expand our money supply and keep interest rates down, even though the more bonds we sell, the greater out government debt (to China) since bonds are pretty much governmnet IOUs. . . In the long run, remember that the money people save is the same money banks use to lend out to borrowers. Without bond sales by the FED, the lack of savings in banks will shrink the pool of availiable money (excess reserves) banks have for loans. They will respond by raising interest rates. Investors will borrow less at higher interest rates. As costs increase, firms will cut production, people will be laid-off, and spending will once again decline with savings experiencing a rebound. Recession will return and be gone when increased savings has helped expand the pool of loanable funds, interest rates lower, and investment is attractive again. This is the buisiness cycle, an inevitable by-product of capitalism.. . By the way, I'm an AP Macroeconomics teacher. :)

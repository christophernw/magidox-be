Well, it's the democrats and media that keep Kerrys mishap.   going. Tony Snow said, is it too hard to just apologize to.   our troops?  Even Democrats (Hillary Clinton) are calling his remarks inappropriate.  Kerry himself said he does not intend.  to apologize as it was a joke about Bush. Duh, I don't think. so.  Kerry has belittled. our troops several times before saying we're the problem in. Iraq and we're terrorizing the citizens, and more. The American. Legion is outraged, so don't blame all the opposition on Repub-. licans.  Hey, Bush isn't even running for an elected office...he's.  still good for 2 more years. (And by the way, Rush Limbaugh.  isn"t running for a political office either tho they keep bringing.  up his name)>

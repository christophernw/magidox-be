either. I prefer it neat with a water back but, plenty of people have it on the rocks. When my Dad passed away this last year -- we took it right out of the bottle. I have 9 brothers and sisters and we had a wake of sorts and passed the bottle around and everyone kept taking a pull. My Dad was a larger than life John Wayne kind of a guy who used to ride the rails from rodeo to rodeo riding bulls and broncos so our salute would have been much to his liking.

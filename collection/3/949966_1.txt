could possibly create a virus that kills them...but then there's a risk that it will mutate and infect humans.  someone should take that idea and turn it into a screenplay!. . really though, why would you want to? eradicating all mosquitos would absolutely destroy the ecological balance in many areas.  despite the pain they cause and the disease they spread, mosquitos play a pretty big role as a food source and in population control.  they cause more good than harm.

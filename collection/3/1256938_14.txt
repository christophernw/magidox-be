Alot of it has to do with healthy learning habits. Alot of people like to just say kids are fat because they eat to many fatty foods and leave it at that. But thats simpifying something that is a bigger problem. Kids see their parents not exercise and veg out infront of the tv so then kids naturally repeat what they see and do the same. Plus with more and more parents leaving their kids alone in the house for many hours kids learn to rely on the indoor entertainment of TV and Computers which provide no exercise. If poeple want adolesents to change habits to be healthier then parents have to start changing their habits too.. Also with more and more unhealthy products being produced like junkfood, soda pop and more and more candy kids are being tricked into gaining weight.. Another hidden weight gainer is premade food. All those frozen dinners and freezer frys are being made for the children of working parents but those foods are full of hydrogenated oils...which our bodys can't break down so they can get stored as fat.

The difference is in the binder that holds the pigment together and makes the paint adhere to the paper.  Poster paint generally has a cheap binder like glue, watercolors in little tubes have a binder like gum arabic, which is of a higher quality.. Another difference is going to be in the quality of the pigments.. Watercolors, depending on the brand, are going to be formulated with higher quality pigments than poster paint.

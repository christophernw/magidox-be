Heaven will be a place where we know God and have a close loving friendship with Him.  Jesus has prepared a place for us in heaven, we will not marry or be given in marriage but we will be like the angels.  Our minds will be comformed into the likeness of Christ.  We won't have the same bodies we had on earth, intstead we will have a body that is adapted for living in heaven.

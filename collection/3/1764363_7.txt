You need to get a crate.  This will help.  And you also need to quit attributing motives like revenge to your dog.  He doesn't do it for payback.  Dogs don't think that way.  Only people feel the need for that kind of satisfaction.  He may be experiencing anxiety over your departure, and in his ensuing panic, he urinates out of nervousness. Talk to your vet about it, and try to figure out how to make your dog feel better.

God bless you and be encouraged. You continue to stay focus.. The word of God says "do not throw your pearls to the swine".. "Dust your feet off" and keep going to those who are open to receive. Non-believers will be given a opportunity to come to know Jesus as Lord by the appointed person for that appointed time. God is even more merciful to those who don't believe. They just don't want stability and temperance of their minds and bodies. we have to pray for them continually.

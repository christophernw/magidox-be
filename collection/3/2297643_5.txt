There are a lot of bad things happening to consumers like you from credit card companies when you havn't been late but you have high balances.. . Chek out your credit card agreements. The ones that banks are sending out have horrible clauses in them like:. . If you are late by one day we will raise your interest to 31.99%. . If you are over limit(doesn't matter if it was interest charges of fees that made you go over limit) twice in 6 months your rate will go up to 31.99%. . If you are late with any other creditor(that means they are monitoring your credit file) your interest rate will go up to 31.99%. . The best part is most of the "penalty interest" only goes into effect for 6 months. So if you can get the balances down on all your cards in 6 months you can probably get bak to "normal" credit card interest rates.. . Best advice, if you can't afford it don't buy it. Use your debit card for most of your purchases.. . Good Luck

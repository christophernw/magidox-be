Houses (and housing) are expensive compared to today's wages.  Many Americans are just barely getting by.  If someone who's just barely getting by loses his job, or has an illness that stops him working and adds medical bills, then it's more and more likely that he'll not be able to make his house payments, and won't have saved enough money to tide him over.. . You'd have to make housing more available and less expensive.  Good luck with that.

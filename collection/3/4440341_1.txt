Proverbs 22:26, 27 state, "Be thou not one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts. If thou has nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?" . . Proverbs 6:1, 2 says, "My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, thou art snared with the sayings of thy mouth, thou art taken with the sayings of thy mouth" (See verses 3-5).. . Proverbs 11:15 states: "He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: And he that hateth suretyship is sure." . . Many a man will do this for a friend long known and trusted; but no wise man will act for a stranger. Often, parents, will sign notes or loans with their children. There is a principle seen in these biblical words of wisdom. No one should cosign (guarantee) with another on any amount which possibly could fall back upon their responsibility to pay.

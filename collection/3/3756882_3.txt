I am concerned that the drivel you have had in answers can sway you especially the one before this whilst he may mean well is also wrong. Your question does not give a clear picture.. I am concerned that you say fix. Has the belt snapped, if it has then there can be damage, it could have damaged valves, ETC, it may be easier to scrap the car than to fix it, do your sums and don't be sentimental.. Find a garage to do it , or get hold of an autodater book and read the instructions and follow them to the letter, if it's just replacement. then fine &#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;belt £10-16 Labour UK £40.00. Good Luck.

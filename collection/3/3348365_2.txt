If you've chosen a major where math isn't so important, the math requirements are probably pretty light.. . I majored in Music and took an Introduction to Symbolic Logic course - didn't feel like math at all.  . . Sometimes an applied math course will be easier because you can actually see how what you're learning will be useful to you.  . . Talk to an advisor at your school to pick the best course for you, and then take advantage of all the things there are to help you - study groups, extra time with the professor, online help, do all your homework, etc.. . Good Luck!

Sunlight is believed to affect the production of Endorphins. These hormones play a role in giving us a sense of "well-being" and happiness.  Researchers are also studying the link between lack of sunlight and the affects on melatonin, serotonin and other hormones as well as the lack of sunlight and its affect on the body's circadian rhythms. So, if the lack of sunshine affects these hormones to produce a type of depression, sometimes called Seasonal Affective Disorder, sunshine and the proper exposure to it, would reverse this and allow our bodies to produce these hormones naturally and give use the "happy" feelings.

Brining the turkey infuses the flavors throughout the turkey without drying it out. That can't be accomplished by just rubbing the bird with the seasonings. There are a variety of recipes to use for brining. My favorite includes the following ingredients;. honey, dijon mustard, salt marjoram, garlic-pepper blend. . . There are others that use simply a vegetable soup. It all depends upon your preferences. The juiciness of the turkey will remain even if you freeze it.  If you prefer a simpler turkey then do that. It's all a matter of how much time you have for your turkey prep and how you want it to taste.

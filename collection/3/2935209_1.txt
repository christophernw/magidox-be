There is a website that tracks all ahips at sea:. http://www.sailwx.info/. Just click on "ship tracker", and it will display the cruise ships currently at sea. The only problem is, I don't think it's updated frequently when the ship is diverted due to weather. I wason a cruise in September, and we had to divert due to Hurricane Rita. My parents said they could not get the information to see where the ship was. Good Luck!

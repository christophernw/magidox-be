Not funny. But I will answer this as if you were being respectful to the spirits.  They appear to those who can see them in a 'normal' way.   I actually witnessed a spirit who, in life, was only allowed to wear skirts.  She laughed and showed me her jeans.  No, she wasn't someone I knew.   Not everyone can see them, this is not a fault of yours, but it is passed through bloodlines.  If you were able to connect with spirits, I think you would be more respectful.

Animals don't evolve, POPULATIONS evolve.  Evolution happens from one generation to the next, not in a generation.  Genetic mutations in the sperm, egg, and zygote are the source of evolution.  All the cells in the animal coming out of those mutated sex cells will then carry the mutated genes, so they will be "evolved" and their future offspring can possible be too.. . Other things factor into evolution too, like isolation of populations.  If a group of apes is somehow isolated (like being surrouned by mountains and a river) from another group, the mutations of one generation have a far greater chance of being passed on to the next, and if so, much faster as well.    Over time, the group may have so many important genetic mutations passed on and on that they evolve into a toally different species.  Then the process continues on and on.... . Also, just to add, any random genetic mutation isn't very important at all.  There are different types of genetic mutations, such as insertions and deletions, and they have to occur at places where the genetic code is important.  For apes and humans, "most" of the genetic code is apparently useless.  But, contrastingly, a single coding gene may affect many, many different things in the body.  So, you might have mutations that dont do anything, but all of a sudden have one or two that change a lot.

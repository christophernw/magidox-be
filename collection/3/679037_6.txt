The media has a huge impact on girls' body image. Look at all of the magazines that are out there telling girls that they need to be beautiful, thin and perfect in order to be loved.  Look at all of the diet gimmicks that are out there and how quickly they come and go. Just seeing the vast array of information out there shows that girls are expected to look a specific way.. . I think that media expectations creates a lot of problems for young girls and women of all ages.  It creates superficial expectations instead of focusing on healthy bodies and interesting character as the most worthy parts of a female's life.

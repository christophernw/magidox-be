purposely get a stomach infection that makes u puke up everything.  Don't eat and drink nothing but water and cayenne peppers.  Oh yea, and take laxatives.... . WTF. Are you kidding me...you're one of those procrastinators that sees that summer's here and you waited to get in shape.  Just get to the gym and do some cardio and cut carbs, sugar and fat.  You'll lose weight but not in 2 friggin weeks.

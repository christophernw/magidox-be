Some of us can lie like a rug and you will believe it. I can look you dead in the eye, I don't sweat, stutter or become fidgety, for I myself believe the lie or false face i put forward. I don't like me why would anyone else. now days people arent so easy to read. We all make choices and take chances its your turn.

Endometriosis is a common and chronic gynecological and immunological disease that can result in pelvic pain. About 2-4% of women and girls of reproductive age and up to 30% of women with infertility have endometriosis. That amounts to approximately 5.5 million women in the United States and Canada.. . The disease occurs when endometrial cells (the cells that line the inside of the uterus) develop outside of their normal location inside the uterus. The misplaced endometrial cells respond to the menstrual cycle in the same way as those lining the uterus. The tissue grows and sheds blood at the time of menses. However, instead of flowing out of body through the vagina, the blood shed by the misplaced cells has no way of leaving the body. The resulting internal bleeding can lead to chronic inflammation and the formation of adhesions and scar tissue.

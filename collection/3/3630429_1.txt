a loan is when you borrow money and promise to pay.. . a mortgage is what you give to the bank as collateral for the loan. . . most people think the loan is the mortgage, but it isn't.. . many states now use a contract for deed so there isn't even a mortgage anymore. The laws for foreclosing with a mortgage are sever, the deed for contract makes it much easier to foreclose. (months rather than years)

Otherkin is a subculture made up of people who describe themselves as being non-human in some way, usually believing themselves to be mythological or legendary creatures.The word is a neologism primarily used by members of that subculture, and is somewhat fluid in definition, and in its broadest sense includes those who consider themselves to be animals, aliens, extradimensional beings, and any other non-human entities.. . Most otherkin believe that they have non-human aspects that are either spiritual or religious in nature.According to otherkin.net, some claim that they are human in a physical sense, but non-human ("other") in a mental or spiritual one.Some otherkin attribute this discrepancy to reincarnation or having the soul of another species.. According to otherkin.net, there are also otherkin who believe themselves to be biologically non-human, considering themselves to physically be members of the species they associate themselves with, or at least directly descended from the species through intermarriage with humanity. This belief is rarer within the subculture, and sometimes the subject of criticism from otherkin who do not share it.Other otherkin, without necessarily claiming to be genetically related to a supernatural being, profess to be physically influenced in some way by their non-human sides.

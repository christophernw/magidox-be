I don't believe in a god, but I don't really think "he" does or has.  Most of society before Christianity and Judaism was female-dominated or "equal", and homosexuals have only been persecuted for the last thousand or so years.  Many Greeks had homosexual relationships, and the love between men was considered the purest form.

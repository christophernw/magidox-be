A finch is a passerine bird.  Passerines are most easily defined as birds with straight triangular beaks adapted for eating seeds.  Finches are usually fairly small with short rounded wings, sturdy tails, and short seed-cracking beaks.  The most widely recognized pet finch is the zebra finch.  These little finches are about the size of two cotton balls.  Members of the finch family include sparrows, cardinals, and canaries. Finches are found primarily in the norther hemisphere, but also Asia, Africa, and Australia.

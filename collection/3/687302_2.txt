When the Battle for the Alamo took place, Texas was a country on its own. Years later, at the termination of the war...Treaty of Guadalupe Hildago...the area was to be part of the US along with California and the territory between the 2 states...later called New Mexico and Nevada. . . The US was fighting for more territory to expand itself, not for another country.  When Texas joined the union, Samuel Houston became one of its two United States senators...probably part of the deal.

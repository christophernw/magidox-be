Alchemy is a science of mind, spirit, and matter. if you do not master the essence of nature, god, and man, you will not be able to do anything. Alchemy is the force that causes growth from "seeds" of matter, such as how metals form, or even how plants develope. Alchemy is not to be confused with chemistry, as chemistry is an artificial science, and cannot produce results that are new and different.

Ray Nagin is a demagogue and like all demagoues he is a master at playing upon the emotions of people.There is a power in lying and there can be great power in great lying.Hitler did the same thing and he is the father of the Big Lie.That is,no matter how outrageous the accusation:tell it often enough and tell it to enough people and it will be believed.. It becomes a circular argument,a closed loop.. One person will say it and ask for an opinion to back up his opinion.Then it continues that way until all whom are going to believe it,do believe it.. The decieved treat the lie as a sermon of truth:a doctrine of faith.. In the case of New Orleans as well as Germany,the lie won.History will take care of it and Nagin will be shown to be what he is:as will New Orleans.. You must close your mind to believe a lie:to open it to counter-argumentation would tend to muddy the waters.People do not want muddy water,they want clear.Yet in the end the muddy waters gets as clear as crystal.

I'd suggest learning Flash.  Even though you don't think you have time, it's a really simple program--if you've ever used Maya before it's nearly identical.  . . Or, just cut out the characters, glue them to popcicle sticks, prop up your bg and film the whole thing like a puppet show with a camcorder.  Doing your own voices is a plus.  :P

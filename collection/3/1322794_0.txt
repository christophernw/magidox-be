As of today, New York is 16 degrees Celsius and 61 degrees Farenheit. It's also cloudy, rainy, and windy. By November seventeenth it'll be worse so bring jackets, jeans, raincoats, and sweatshirts. You might need to dress up for trips to restaurants and theaters. Black or dark blue two piece suits are best. Otherwise go informal. Just look good to yourself.

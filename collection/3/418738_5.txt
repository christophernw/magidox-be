It's ALMOST always best to slow down whenever confronting a situation where you're not in control and you know there is the possibility of danger.  But this is one of those cases where it's often better just to speed up.  However, if people don't let you in, or they're not paying attention, they'll hit you, and then blame you for not looking where you're going.  So it's a dangerous situation regardless of what you do.  Just be aware of this from both sides of the fence, and do your best to make room for the retards.  You'll be glad you did.

If you've done something that makes you feel guilty, ask the person you wronged to forgive you. Whether that person will forgive you or not is not up to you, but you will feel better knowing you did the right thing asking for forgiveness. . . If the guilty feeling keeps creeping back (yes I've had experience feeling guilty :), just remember that we all make mistakes. Sometimes we have to forgive ourselves, too.. . On a deeper note, ask God to forgive you of all the wrong things you've done and thought. He will forgive you, and you will be as white as snow - it's Biblical.

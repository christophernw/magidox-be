According to the theory of evolution, apes AND humans BOTH evolved from some primate that was extinct long ago. So humans did NOT evolve from apes, humans and apes evolved together yet separately.. But I believe personally that God created us all differently yet I still accept the scientific explanation but some people just have trouble accepting both science and religion.

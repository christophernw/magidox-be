It's a condition known as a "recessed penis", and from my son's pediatrician said, it's fairly common. His penis should extend on its own as he gets a bit older, and loses some of his body fat. One thing that we were told to do, however, is to slather Vaseline along the length of his penis to keep the circumcision scar from growing adhesions. This has already happened with my son.

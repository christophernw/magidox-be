Mrs. Maguire in 5th grade. she had a voice that would irritate chalk on the board, was old as dirt and really didnt seem to be in the game anymore. Sister Mary George in 8th grade. she was over 6 foot, weighed at least 250 and her fondest habit(excuse that bad pun) was picking up kids and throwing them across the room when they pis*ed her off.

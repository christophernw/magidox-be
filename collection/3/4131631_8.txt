Because they are indoctrinated from the moment they can have a cognative thought.  Comic books, TV shows, stories in school that start out "millions of years ago" lay the foundation for accepting an unsupportable premise.. . To Frank - "held as an explanation or account" and "is proported or accepted as accounting for" are phrases that define the word "faith", so all you've done is prove what I keep saying - - it takes more faith to believe in evolution than in a Creator.. . To Randy - So when did genetecists change there conclusions from about 12 years ago?  They stated that because gene lengths that differ could not combine, and in fact, if the RNA sequence on the genes is not identical, they also cannot combine, this literally disproves the possibility of 'evolution of species'.  If 'mutation' of species were to occur and continue, then one male and one female of the specie being observed would have to have the exact same genetic mutation at the exact same time, find each other and procreate.  The mathematical probability of this happening one time, much less thousands of times for a species to 'evolve' is less than one in a googolplex.

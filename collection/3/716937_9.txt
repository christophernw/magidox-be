Your body is made up of 70% water.  Becoming dehydrated can cause many different health issues.  Your body can not properly function if it is not hydrated.  A good rule of thumb to follow is 1/2 of your weight converted into ounces, so if you weigh 100 lbs, you would need 50 oz. per day.  Also, if you drink anything like soda or a caffinated beverage it can deydrate you.  You need to drink an aditional amount of water equal to the size of that beverage to counteract the effects.. I never used to drink water and wondered why so many people thought it was such a big deal.  When I finally started drinking the right amount I found out why!. you can sleep better, digest better, have fewer headaches, regulate your weight better....(it is one of the best kept weight watching tips of all times) over or under weight, water helps you get to where you should be.. your brain function improves, meaning memory, moods, everything.  Water is very important.

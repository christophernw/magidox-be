It depends on a variety of factors.  . . Years ago when I lived in England, it was fine for men to have one beer with lunch at the pub but very nearly everyone in the village walked or rode the bus, so there was no difficulty with drunken driving.. . My husband worked night shifts, and so it was not odd for him to have a beer at 7 am, but it was the end of the day for him.. . I personally think lunchtime or later is well enough, but that exceeding 2 or 3 beers in a normal day probably points to a problem.  And of course, you should NEVER EVER drive afterward!. . I suppose I'll probably get a few snappy remarks to this response...

Spraying can be a marking behavior or symptom of disease.. If it's behavioral, you'll need to remedy the cause (have the ovariohysterectomy performed, increase the number of litter boxes throughout the house, clean them/change them frequently, etc.). If it's a disease, you'll need to find the cause and fix it (Urinary tract infection, bladder stone, etc.). Either way, you need to clean all the urine with an enzymatic cleaner (Anti-Ickypoo, Nature's Miracle, Urine off).. Go see a vet.

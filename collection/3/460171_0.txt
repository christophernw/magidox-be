If it is starch, and it could be, it's water soluble. Iron a very damp towel and keep refolding and moving the towel around so that you are over new areas. Wash the towel before it dries to get the starch out of it. Next time you are ironing with spray starch, keep a sheet of wax paper handy and run the iron over it a few times before you use the starch. It will help prevent starch build-up.. . If the sole of the iron is bare metal(instead of coated with teflon) you can use very fine steel wool (0000) grade to gently remove the starch and polish the sole plate.

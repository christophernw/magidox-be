It's mainly a difference in the heat input by the sun.. . The total amount of CO_2 on Earth and Venus is actually pretty much the same, it's just that Venus has the CO_2 in the atmosphere whereas Earth has most of the CO_2 outside the atmosphere (e.g. tied up in Carbonates that can't survive on Venus or in the oceans, etc).. . The higher power from the sun caused Venus to lose any water it might have had (and even without an atmosphere Venus would be at about 100 Â°C) and the higher temperatures caused the CO_2 that was held in rocks to be released into the atmosphere leading to even higher temperatures and the mess that is there now.

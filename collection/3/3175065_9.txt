We had to get rid of our toy poodle (sad to say) because my son who was 5 at the time, was too rough with the dog.  Toy Poodles have fragile little bones and kids tend to be too rough with them.  My suggestion, if you are wanting a small dog and have young children, would be to get a miniature dachshund or other breed that has sturdy bones.  A stocky little dog would be a better choice because they can handle the "rough and tumble" playing better.

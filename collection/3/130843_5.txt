A dead turtle doesn't slip out of its shell the way a snail does when dead. It is attached by many muscles as well as skin and other tissues.  Bugs are a good way to clean it, especially dermestid beetles. But in the absence of suitable bugs the only way to do it without damaging the shell is one bit at a time, knife, scissors and tweezers.  In other words, dissect it out.  A snail shell can be cleaned out chemically because the shell is essentially inorganic calcium salts.  But a turtle shell is bone, which has an organic matrix, and any chemical that will dissolve the tissues within the shell will also badly damage the shell itself.

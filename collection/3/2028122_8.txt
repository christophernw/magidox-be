dude 17 is the best age. you can date someone thats 15-20 with no problem unless you act immature. the cons would be that you cant go to the club or to certain places that you could go if you were 18 but when you are like 25 you kinda miss being 17 and not having any bills to worry about, just going out and having fun. cherish the moments when you can just have a good time and enjoy life!

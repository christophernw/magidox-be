Parents only want what's best for their teenagers, so it's natural to discourage smoking, drinking, slacking at school, etc. Unfortunately this is the time when teenagers need to experiment and find themselves. They can only do this by being burnt. And they only realise that it was for the best AFTER the teen years. The way it goes!

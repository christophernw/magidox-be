I think there is a wide range. I had a math teacher once who told the class she was agnostic - that she wasn't sure one way or the other if God existed. I believe atheists would think they are entirely sure - and some of them are sure at the top of their lungs. That's all right, since true believers can persuade others more easily by sticking to quiet, kind ways.

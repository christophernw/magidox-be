If you contact Toys for Tots - they get tractor trailer full of gifts that don't sell, and with proper authorization you can get all you need from them.  Oh, but you won't get the Jesus dolls, they sent those back to the donator.. . Wal-Mart has a policy which allows store managers to use their discretion and donate merchandise.  Target does not allow store managers to do the same.  Meijer's (if you're in the midwest) will also support charities.. . One thing that you probably need to do, though, is get "proof" that you're legitimate, either from the hospital that you intend to do this with, and get a letter from them, perhaps listing the "types" of toys that can be allowed.  You might want to try to figure out what age range you're going to shoot for, since you won't know who will be in the hospital until the day that you show up (children get admitted and discharged, and we try to send all but the absolute sickest children home for the holidays - because we are short on staff as well as to help the children's holidays).  . . Also be aware that there will be non-Christian children, so will this be for Hannukah, too?  And what about Muslim and Hindu children?  You don't want to offend them - so perhaps make it more of a "December solstice" type of gift.

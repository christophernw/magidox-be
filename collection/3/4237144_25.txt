The origin lies in the plagues that decimated the population of Europe in the middle ages. Early signs of succumbing to plague including cold-like symptoms such as sneezing. Thus alarmed friends would bless those who sneezed, fearing the worst.. . This is also the origin of the children's rhyme "Ring a ring a roses". Its words include "Atishoo, atishoo, we all fall down". All fall down literally referring to the mass fatalities of the plague. Even the title, a ring of roses, refers to the sores on the face and body - gruesome!

You might be dyslexic. Go to your counselor or your parents and tell them about your problem. Until then try studying in a quiet room,prefably in a desk or chair(studying on your bed tends to make you too comfortable which makes you sleepy)and concentrate. Take a rest if you need to,for about 15 or 20 minutes by eating a snack or listening to a little music.

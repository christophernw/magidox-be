im afraid that worms can sometimes cause bad constipation. (especially when given as the only diet and especially mealworms) Far too much calories and hardish shell.  that is exacly if u lived on a diet of only Macdonald hamburgers AND u had to eat also the box they come with. if it is not late or if the problem has not corrected by itself try some cooking oil. in any case give him some water so that it does not get degydrated. What gecko do you have and how long have u kept it? wish u good luck and let us know. BTW no reptile should be fed only by worms. is this the case? I give only mealworms by one as treats.  you MUST get him some crickets, locusts, moth larvae. mealworms MUSTNOT be main part of diet.

Um, no.  Sounds like a pregnancy test is in order.... Indulging in fattening foods AFTER, or before sex--or anytime for that matter--can make you fat, but not sex.  As I hinted at the start, having sex can make you PREGNANT, if you're female, but not fat, per se.  The best way to lose weight is the old fashioned way: avoid sweets and increase exercise.

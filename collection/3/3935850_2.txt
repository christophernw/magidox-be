Is it worth it? Maybe you could just get a car with one? But, if you must, then you'll have to buy one of the pop-out ones, cause there's no way to put in the sliding one as it won't have any space to slide into if you car was not meant to have one. I'd get it done by a pro, cause I had a car with a sunroof that was added later and it wasn't that great. It would leak constantly.

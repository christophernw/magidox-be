Religion is a set of beliefs/doctrines and rules. These can be christian, or anything else.. . Christianity, however is not a religion, it is a relationship. When you become a Christian you get into a relationship with Jesus. Your life becomes not a set of rules but "what pleases Him". Jesus said there are two "rules" - Love God, Love others. Quite simple!

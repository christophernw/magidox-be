Impetigo is usually seen as a sore next to a child's nose, but it can be anywhere.  It spreads easily especially under a kid's fingernails.  It needs to be treated with triple antibiotic or by RX from doctor.  And of course practice good hand-washing.  kids give it to each other through a lot of hand contact.  It is easy to catch if one has an open sore.  It can also live under the diaper area..ouch! It leaves scarring if left untreated long enough.

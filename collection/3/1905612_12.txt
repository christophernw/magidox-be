Uh, what's religon got to do with it?. . Anyways, who cares, it might not even be a real PIC of them anyways... you just never know.... ;-). . Unless you see them through live feed of a webcam.. Then you should know for sure what they look like, unless they face the cam on oh say they're pet LOL.. . ;-). . I think the avitars ARE cool.. Hey, ever watch "The Avitar, the last air bender" on Nick?. Or the movie "Cyber Wars" were the bad guys were cyber avitars?. . I wonder why yahoo called them avitars, they're just animated pictures not a projection of ones self.. Hmmmm who know.... . Cya!. ::: Peace :::

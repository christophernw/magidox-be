I went vegatarian recently ( about 4 months ago ) to help me lose some weight. It has helped this is because when I get wasted I always want to indulge in a hamburger or something meaty but since I went veggie all I want is to eat healthy and my views on meat and processing has changed. I still think meat looks and smells good, but I just have no desire for it anymore. I am sure there will be a time when I will eat meat again, just not any time soon - personal choice.

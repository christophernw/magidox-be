Perhaps you want a website that will take the pictures of both parents and somehow morph them?  The resulting photo will be more silly than a useful indication of what your offspring might look like.  Find a genetic planner and discuss the traits that you both possess, and you might figure out which traits are more likely to be dominant.  You can come up with educated guesses for hair and eye color, etc., but nothing more definitive than that.

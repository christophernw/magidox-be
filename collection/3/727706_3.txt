One factor is stress--to make good money you have to have a good profession---and most well paid professions are stressful.(I am talking about those 80.000-100.000 dollar jobs)Just look at registered nurses who make a lot of money-look at it how they have to work and how much time that leaves them---or, look at the CEO's with their million dollar incomes.  They do have adequate health insurance all right, but they have all that responsibility, they are accountable for what their staff does---so they have to work a lot of long hours, eat junk food, and have little time to go to the doctor.  I will give you an example here, because I did work in retail:. . The store was getting ready for an inspection.  So the manager was responsible to ensure that everything in the store was neat, clean, stocked up, etc.etc.  This responsibility got delegated to the department managers who in turn assigned certain tasks to the supervisors and those were the ones who told us what to do.  Now, when my shift was over, it was over.  I was able to go home.  Same with the supervisors.  But the managers had to stay there and finish it up, no matter how long it took---and they don't really get paid overtime.  So, if you have to work like this, how much time do you have to go to the dentist/doctor, and how good of a meal can you eat then?  That is one reason why people with good incomes are in comparatively bad health.

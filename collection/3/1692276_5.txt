A sacrifice to God is something you give that cost you something. That something could be anything. The ultimate sacrifice is when someone gives their lives in sacrifice to the Lord. I have not come to that level when i can give anything, right now i think i can give basically any of my material thing to God, but what happens if it was my life, my family? Its not easy but i often pray for the grace to give this too to the Lord if it comes to that.

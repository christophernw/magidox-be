Prob would choose losing my legs. I watch discovery chanel all the time and see amazing children and adults functioning, running marathons without legs, whether they be artificial legs or in a wheelchair. But losing my sight, that is a frightening thought. I love nature, beautiful sceneries, observing people, Donald's face (haha) to much to dare want to lose my sight.

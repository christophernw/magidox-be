Media has a lot to do with the way people view themselves. Movies, commercials, celebrities, magazines, just about anything. The standard beauty is not what it use to be. Now people are rushing to be thin and then they're so thin they look like skin and bones. Plastic surgery is ruining a lot of people, and even teenagers are doing it. The media has affected everyone's life, making them think they're ugly when there's nothing wrong with them.

If you live in a heavily polluted area like a big city. The lower astral is very close to physical. I have found that these experiences are assosiated with an inner humming sound. More than one person may be humming at once and are connected to the experience. Upon completely waking the experience becomes somewhat vauge and hard to remember. The connection made here is very femminen. And very creepy followed by a wave of chills upon each person involved.. . In extream cases the humming becomes almost screaming and a very high resonance is created. This is also scary but usually followed by alot of laughter from all the people involved. Its really hard to say if it is evil. It is very scarry but it is also very awakining and exciting.The laughing has pointed out that it could be positive.. . P.s.  The not being able to move feeling  has to do with the transition from the astral plane. The mind works differently there and when you transition you have to relax and adjust or it will feel like you can't move. Universally commen occurence.Its because of the reflective nature. when you try to go forward you go backward.

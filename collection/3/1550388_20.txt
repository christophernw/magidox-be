It has been a misconception all through history that Hitler only picked on the Jewish.  This is not true.  The Jewish are the most famous, however he also picked on people with physical and mental disabilities.  Hitler believed in cleansing of the human race and he did this by targeting people he felt was not pure; people that were flawed by his own definitions.

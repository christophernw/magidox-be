First I would like to think they could but no they cannot live in the same place. Judaism (Jewish) is the oldest faith of the three related faiths. The Islamic or Muslim faith were created from a militant aspect and is an off shoot of Judaism. They basically have the beginning of there bibles looking the same to include christianity. Where the breakdown occurs is during the crusades. The muslims conquered Jerusalem and the Israelis and Christians. After World War 2 The world felt sorry for the Jewish people and created Israel in 1947 from the country of Palestine. Then there has been war from this moment on that the christian world could just take a coutry and give it to someone else. The Israeli's are a very good fighting machine. They took on Syria, Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Egypt, Jordan. These countries have lost every time  to the israelis. No they hate each other too much and every suicide bombing brings them closer to war.

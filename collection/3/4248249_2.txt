Some real estate company's also deal in rental property.  In other words, they find someone to rent your house.  Mine was a real go getter. The only problem was that it was taking longer and longer to reciever our money from him.  Found out he was taking it and using it because he had a gambling problem. And it was not just from us. He took money from two other friends of ours that sold their houses through him. And I mean $400,000 homes.  Needless to say, he lost his license and our friends are taking him to court for embezzlement.  This ought to be fun as we are witnesses against him.

I wasn't that impressed with the documentary.  Of course, they could be hacked, but the important thing is to verify that they are not.  The vast conspiracy required to pull something like that off was under-represented in that show.  . . Look at this way, do you pay at the pump for gas and throw away your receipt?  They could be hacked, but I feel pretty safe with them.

It is not fair to say that if you treat a girl fine she will always leave you for an abusive man. Any woman who deliberately goes into an abusive relationship needs help, professional help, to dig to the bottom of her sickness. I feel quite sorry for anyone who does that to herself.. . And don't let the fact that one girl left you even though you treated her with the respect that any human being is due, make you turn abusive yourself. Nice guys DO finish first.

Even on holidays I have noticed this problem. Where I live, more and more people are turning to the self checkouts. This is unusual and seems to have more people than the other two that are open. It is also slower, depending on the person's knowledge of the self checkout. Why can't they just hire more people and keep those checkouts streamlined? I get very anxious when I go to Wal-mart and try to avoid it all together. Don't even attempt to ask for assistance with a large item. They make you stand in line and everyone behind you starts breathing hard.. . Wal-mart is a good company...you think they would have learned this from trial and error....go figure!

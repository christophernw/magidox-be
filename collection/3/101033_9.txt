Well, go to the store and buy the deoderizers and then you tell her " Hey! I tried these for my shoes and they worked awesome. I bought you two. One for your son and one for you to try because I was really impressed. Or, just stick it in her son's shoes when they're not looking or just flat out tell the kid if you're a wiseguy!

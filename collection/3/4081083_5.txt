I would think its menopause I went thru it and it wasnt nice.. they gave me a pill it made it worse... Talk to your family and let them help you thru it ... I got chickens and when I felt like that I would go just watch them and since there was so much going on in there It took my mind off whatever was bothering me.. Laugh. Love . Live

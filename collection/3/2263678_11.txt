Dogs have sensitive hearing, and depending on the type of ring and the volume of the ring sound of your telephone, it could be hurting your dog's ears.  The dog most likely isn't hearing a ringing sound, as you are, instead the dog might be hearing a high pitched squealing sound which is hurting the dog's ears, possibly even causing some damage to the eardrums.  I suggest that you try a different ring tone and volume on you telephone.

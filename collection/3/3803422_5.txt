too much bacteria in the digestive tract, you could have irritable bowel, a whole list of diseases that could cause diarrhea.  You really should consult a doctor if this has been going on for any length of time.  Try the BRAT diet in the meantime (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast), keep well hydrated with water, cheese may also slow down the runs.  Avoid a lot of sugar as this can cause loose stools also, as well as taking a lot of anti acids.

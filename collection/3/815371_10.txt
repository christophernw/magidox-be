The English language is a combination of many other languages such as Latin, Greek, Spanish, and more European influences. The rule is generally correct but due to the hybrid of sources this can not be used all the time. Various example can be given, but I shall leave it as this. Languages do not always follow the rule so because our dialect is truly a bunch of languages combine it has different rules for each origin.

Who is the official - or unofficial organizers in your work place? These people will know what is going to happen. It sounds like you have an evening of cash bar cocktails and silly games ahead of you. Those games can be fun, they are usually grown up versions of kids party games. . . At one workplace, we played Pin the nose on Rudolph... except the Rudolph was our supervisor with a Velcro sticky on the end of his nose. The opposite side of the Velcro was stuck to a pompom. We were blindfolded (everyone at the same time) and the first person to stick their pompom to the boss's face won.. . Good Luck. Be joyful. And unless you really REALLY trust your co-workers, limit yourself to that one drink...

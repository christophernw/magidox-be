The "Spelling Alternatives" is a tool that suggests correct spelling for words that are not spelled correctly. Using sophisticated proximity and phonetic algorithms, coupled with the glossaries installed, it shows a list of terms most likely to be the one originally intended by the user. Although it is used primarily for identifying spelling mistakes, it will find similar terms in any glossary installed. As the algorithm employed is resource intensive, it will find similar terms only in local glossaries, and not in subscribed glossaries

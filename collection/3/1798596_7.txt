Play and study are basically the same animal. When you "play" you do learn, but because you are having fun and the lesson is not structured, it is not considered by many to be learning. When you "study" you are attempting to force information to stay in your memory, and usually do not have much interest in it. For those who enjoy a given topic, there seems to be very little study involved. Take cooking for example. People who like to cook do not seem to pick up cook books and read them for hours in order to learn how to measure and mix a recipe. On the other hand, there are serious schools that give instruction (and lots of homework) to teach the art of preparing food. Did your grandma attend one of those schools to learn how to cook so well or did she learn it because she wanted to? . . Learn to enjoy something, and learning it is no longer a chore.

Practice. Wish there was an easier way, but really, the most effective method of becoming an effective speaker is to practice. . . It also helps to video-tape yourself giving a speech. Watch the tape to see what you're doing well and what you can improve on - then practice some more. . . There is an organization called Toastmasters around. They get together for the express purpose of practicing public speaking. It can be a load of fun! Check out the website to see if there is a chapter close to you. . . Good luck and have fun! You'll be speaking like a pro in no time. :)

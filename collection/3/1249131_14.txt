well im a freshman in high school and i just took health class the best thing 4 u 2 do is to tell ur parents a neighbor u trust or a counselor. if u do not tell someone immediately then they could go through with it even if u think they r doing it for attention u should still deffinately tell someone so you can safe their life.  they may just need someone to talk to and you could very well be that person.

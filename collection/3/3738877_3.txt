Try breath mints, mouthwash first and see a dentist.  Sometimes, however, bad breath is a symptom of an internal disorder and not a "disease" in itself and if this is the case, it will not go away with simple "band-aid" solutions above.  You will have to see a doctor to know what the matter is.  The solution could be a simple change in diet or curing the real disease of which bad breath would be a symptom of.

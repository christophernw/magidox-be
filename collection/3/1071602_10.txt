first sit down with your child and get the complete story again. ask him if anybody was there-like friends- who witnessed the incident. write everything down like date, time, witnesses etc. tell the parents of those children who may have been witnesses what happened and ask them to ask their children as well. then get the info from the parent(s). then with your evidence in hand, make an appointment with the principal. let him or her know the facts, how your child was humiliated, physically assaulted by the teacher, and verbally assaulted by teacher. don't ask them what they are going to do about it. you tell them what you want them to do about it. and let them know at the end of your conversation that if the teacher is not dealt with to your satisfaction you will go to the magistrate and swear out a warrant for a class one misdomeanor for assault. of which all witnesses will testify to. hope this helps

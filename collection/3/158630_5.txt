what is so wrong if you are or if you are not.. Be yourself, and be happy with what you have, and hey, most gays nowadays can bench press more than that, as a general practice....and most gays do have their own car, too.. . So...what seems to be the problem...are you definately gay and you are afraid of people knowing you are....or are you definately not, but you are willing to experiment with one...or are you not, and you wish youd be...or are you one of those stereotypes that dresses like gays *because they invented fashion and everything that comes with it* and you are a victim of fashion now, and you dont know what you can do or what style to use ?

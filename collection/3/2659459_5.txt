Mumbai! Wow.. . Well, I know nothing about Mumbai, but may I venture to say that, if there are no recycling facilities there, you could write to your representative politician asking them to organise recycling facilities for you. Also, just start sorting your rubbish out anyway. If you teach your neighbours and friends to do this, at least you will be building awareness about environmental issues. . . Then, just take practical steps, like being exact about boiling water- eg, if you only need a pint of boiling water, don't boil two pints- that's wasting energy. Don't leave lights on for longer than you need to, just try to lead a moderate life in all areas.  . . I think becoming vegetarian is a good step to take, because vegatables take less land than livestock to produce, and the land they grow on is not spoilt- compare with the slash and burn approach to clearing land for livestock in some parts of the world. . . So 1- Campaign for recycling facilities and organise local waste sorting anyway- it's practical in many ways. Also, reuse stuff if you can.. . 2- Limit energy use- it all must come from somewhere.. . 3- Become vegetarian.. . That's about the best I can do, sorry.

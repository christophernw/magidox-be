You have to replace the bad bacteria in you intestine with good bacteria. You can take a probiotic supplement to do that or eat yogurt with live culture. I take a supplement that has 15 different probiotic strains at a concentration of 35 billion CFU, its the best I can find. I learned about it at http://www.bartenblends.com

Don't name the school because there would be a stampeed of parents trying to get in line to enroll their kids!!  I didn't have to get many spankings as a kid to respect my parents!!  I learned at a very young age that I would face consequences for my actions.  It has carried through to adulthood! It's unfortunate that we cannot discipline our children anymore...

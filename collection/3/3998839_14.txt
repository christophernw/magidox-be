The only way to be a better person is to allow the Holy Spirit to conform us into the image of Jesus Christ. We can't just be better people if we try hard enough. We are sinners and Jesus died to save us from that sin. There are many Scriptures that speak of the Spirit life though. A good place to look would be Galatians Chapter 5 which speaks of not living in the flesh but walking in the Spirit and shows what a life in the flesh looks like in contrast to what a life lived walking in the Spirit looks like. Seek Jesus first and He will work in your life the plan He has for you.

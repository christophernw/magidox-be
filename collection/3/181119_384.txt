Waiter. You can explore the world, go on a voyage, see exciting places, and do adrenaline pumping activities. I absolutely loved it! I was a waiter for my first job but I ended up having it for 6 years because it was so fun. You should stop stereotyping, because whatever you don't explore, means you don't know.

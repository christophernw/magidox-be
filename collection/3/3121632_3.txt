great question. ive always wondered that too. my personal conclusion is that when you do anything " worth remembering " a number of people recognize it. as time passes that number decreases more and more and the only thing left that people recognize is that the person who did whatever, has died. then what youve done is remembered and recelebrated so no one will forget.

M not xactly sure but guess....  see, in an atom the number of protons is generally equal to that of electrons.. But it's not always true.. sometimes protons exceed the number . As in here, the at. mass of Na is 23. So i guess it has 11 electrons and 12 protons.. . that makes it 23 on the whole.. Or may be there's some other xplanation

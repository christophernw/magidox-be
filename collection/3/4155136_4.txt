Beano is the trade name of an over-the-counter remedy that reduces intestinal gas from eating certain vegetables.  It contains enzymes that hydrolyze some complex sugars in plants that the human body doesn't have enzymes (or doesn't have enough enzymes) to digest.  . . When the body can't digest them totally, normal healthy bacteria in the gut do the job.  In the process, they produce large quantities of hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide gases.  The enzymes in Beano break down the sugars into more digestible simple sugars before the bacteria can get to them.

If your hand held device can video chat with IM, this should be easy. All you need is 2 IM accounts. Setup your webcam and mic on your computer in the baby's room, login to your IM (Yahoo, MSN, whatever), enable video chat. That's it. Now, wherever you are with your handheld device, login to the IM with your other account. You can see and hear your baby; if you do not want the baby to hear you, mute the mic on your handheld.

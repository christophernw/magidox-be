Honestly, I don't think it matters.  Employers do not ask/look for your GPA, they look for that little slip of paper that says you graduated.  That's it.  Experience counts more, unless, and someone please correct me if I'm wrong, you're applying for a job in academia (at the college level).. . Your references from your internship will be ten times more valuable to employers for your first job.

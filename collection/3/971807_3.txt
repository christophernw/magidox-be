Inertial force is also called  Fictitious Force,   any force invoked by an observer to maintain the validity of Isaac Newton's second law of motion in a reference frame that is rotating or otherwise accelerating at a constant rate. . OR. A fictitious force is an apparent force that acts on all masses in a non-inertial frame of reference, e.g., a rotating reference frame. The force F does not arise from any physical interaction, but rather from the acceleration a of the non-inertial reference frame itself. Due to Newton's second law F = ma, fictitious forces are always proportional to the mass m being acted upon.. . FOR MORE PL. VISIT:. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_force

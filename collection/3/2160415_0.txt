I hope you are referring to 6pm-12pm and not the 6 hrs onwards.. From experience, you wont be able to score much if you study in that one night. you must and should have done revision days ago.. . however, you can try to highlight the important keywords and then understand its elaboration. as long as you know your stuff, you will have no problem explaining it in your own words.

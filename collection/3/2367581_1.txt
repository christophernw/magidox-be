Behaviour can be described as circular, you will in you life have formed heuristics (rules to behave) to help you deal with your life. Sometimes the pattern of behaviour is counter productive and is very hard to break.. . We rely heavily on our past, if you have encountered trouble before doing the things you are having trouble doing now and had negative comments about it then this will directly affect your ability to do things now. . . The barriers of ‘I can’t do something’ are self imposed. There is no other reason you can’t do something other than you don’t believe you can. This is known as self-efficacy, you believe you will behave a certain way, so you do. . . One way you can try and break this is to forget what has happened previously, you past what people have said. The past is not important when you do things, just because it so thing happened like that before doesn’t mean it always will.. . Try to realise the that the only thing that holds you back is you, every pattern of behaviour can be broken. Try to make the things you do fun. Hope that helps 

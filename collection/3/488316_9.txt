Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling mental disorder often developing in men, usually in the late teens or early twenties, and women typically in their twenties and early thirties. People with schizophrenia often experience hallucinations (usually hearing voices not heard by others) or delusions (believing that other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts, or plotting to harm them). . . Persons with schizophrenia usually have disturbed interpersonal relationships.  They are often fearful and withdrawn, with disorganized speech and behavior.  Treatment almost always includes medications.  Newer medications are more effective than older ones and have fewer side effects.

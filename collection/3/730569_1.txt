Egyptian Lion got it.  The fighting has been going on for years, and the way it looks now, it will continue for years becasue two different peoples want one area of land, and both powers are too greedy/angry/selfish/stubborn to make a compromise.  also because now there are palestinian and jewish areas and neither wants to move to help the compromise.

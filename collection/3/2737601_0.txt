I'm not sure that it does only "shatter to the outside".  Forget Hollywood.  The glass will generally go in the direction of the blast pressure, in or out.. . The only reason I could think of that glass might shatter outward despite a blast outside a building would be that many buildings are positively pressurized in part to reduce infiltration of dust and pollution.  If a blast induced enough pressure on glass to shatter it and the pressure differential from the inside of the building were so much greater than the outside air and the outside blast pressure, then it might cause the shattering glass to move outward away from the building rather than inward.. . But that's a lot of hypothetical if's.. . Where did you hear or see such a thing?

Being a snow plow truck operator,I am always asked this question. When we apply salt to the roadway there is actually a process when the cold roadway(snow or ice covered) and salt make heat and thus starts to melt the snow. After applications are made,we have to keep applying salt to keep the roadway from re-freezing again.It is all a chemical reaction that melts the snow.Salt applications are only effective down to a certian temperature and below that,it takes more salt to keep the roadways melted

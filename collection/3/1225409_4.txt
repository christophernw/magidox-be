Friday is because of Black Friday.  This was a day when many people of the church were tortured and killed.  The 13th is from the concept that the bible has 12 as a holy number.  In superstition, the number that follows a holy one must be unlucky and demonic.  Therefore 13 is unlucky.  With the more strict religious people from many years ago the fallacies were put together making the infamous Friday the 13th.

sounds like a universal thing with cats, ours do it, past present and future. Newspapers, magazines, post, cards, carrier bags, even if its a tiny scrap of paper they'll plonk themselves on it and look up at you with a 'what!' expression. I think it's because they can't bear the thought of you showing an interest in something else if they're in  the same room. Try turning the pages and they slap their paws on it or grab it and go all kitteny again and cute. Pull it away and they rip it to pieces...watch the tail, it twitches, you just know they're annoyed really. Dogs love to please, cats have to be pleased, dontcha just love'em!

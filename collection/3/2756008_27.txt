That's easy because someone the other day said that evolution says that the higher we attain on the evolutionary scale the more acceptable homosexuality is - well, as peole live closer to the equator they are undoubtedly going to draw more pigmentation to the surface of their skin than people who don't, so as homosexuality increased and populations became extinct then those that were left had to move into places that they were not accustomed to, take the women for a time, repopulate, and while some went one way, others went others way and now we have a whole world of different races - makes about as much sense to me as the theory of evolution does - I sitll say now that I've become so enlightened as to how wrong I have been in my Christian way of thinking that we should all practice homosexuality, leading to extinction of mankind and therefore, we would not have to worry over global warming, fuel usage, wars, adultery, marriage definitions, God, religions, or much of anything else - we'd be extinct - at least if I understood the explanation correctly as it was given the other day - and I'm sure I did or I would not still be finding myself having to pray for that person's hardness of heart - it did enlighten me as to why the animal kindgom would experience extinction if they evolved and naturally became homosexual in their behavior the higher intelligent they became on the evolutionary scale.

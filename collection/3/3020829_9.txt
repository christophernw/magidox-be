Depending on the person, and the relationship you have with them.. how you got about it.. will vary. If it is your friend.. you should just say" What kind of deodorant do u use? etc. Maybe they notice it too.. or maybe not. My aunt STUNK last Xmas.. and I took her to the room with some deodorant and said " Auntie, your kind of FUNK". LOl. And she started laughing and told everyone at her job.  I was soo nervous.. and she said" Why, your my neice!!".. So .. It all depends on the relationship. If you aren't that close with the person..then go about it slowly.. and suggest a perfume or something.They should thank you, Better you.. then someone else, huh?. good Luck

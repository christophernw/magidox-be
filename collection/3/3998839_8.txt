I love 1 Corinthians Chapter 13:1-13.  I called this the love verses because Jesus is Love.  1)Though I speak witht he tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, (Love), I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal (doing things out of tradition, habit with love in your heart like ie saying I love Jesus or I love you, you are just making a noise to Jesus).  2) And though I hae the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. (You can have all the knowledge of God and have faith but if you do not love what you do or love everyone what you do is nothing to in God's eyes.)  3) And though I bestow allmy goods to feed the the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. 4. Chrity suffereth long, and is kind; chrity envieth not; charity vauneth not itself, is not puffed up. 5. Doty not behave itself unseemly, seekeith not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil: 6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. 8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they sahll cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. 9 for we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 10. but when theat which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. 11. when i was child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, i though as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.  12. for now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known, 13. An now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of thes is charity. (love).

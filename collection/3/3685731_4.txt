Of course there is a special degree for studying UFO's but first you have to study hard and get your associates degree in the study of lepricons and little green men. Of course you then have to get your Bachelours degree in the study of life on the Moon, Mars and Pluto. When you are ready you can get your Masters degree in the study and identification of UFO's.. When you graduate they will supply your gown so there is no need to go out and buy your own.  I suggest that you ask for two gowns because if you wear only one there is a helluva breeze from behind, not to mention the fact that everyone will see your underwear.  When you put the bed pan,,,,,,,,,, uh... uh...I mean cap on, make sure to dry it out good , it may be a little damp.. When they call your name just walk to the front of the room and the nice man dressed in white will give you your degree, he may also give you some medication, just humor him and take it, he thinks you have a head ache..............................hahahaha

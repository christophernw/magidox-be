Higher mathematics, science and astronomy would not be where they are today without the contributions of Muslim scholars. Much of human history would be lost without the preservation methods developed in Muslim countries. Most of the countries you speak of are in Africa, so it would make more sense to say that being poor and living in africa without the means to get a proper education is of greater significance than being muslim.

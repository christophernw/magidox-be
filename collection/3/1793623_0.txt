Hmm ... Jesus scoffed at and mocked the "religious" leaders of the day when He walked the Earth because of their self-centered agendas.  He embodies truth in his life and in his death.. . He either IS the Son of God, or he was a raving lunatic.. . Without reference to God, Jesus Christ, or Holy Spirit ... you are left with finite human answers to your question; none of which you could anchor your faith upon.

i study business and marketing (advertising covers this) its just a fad its a cheep form of advertising thats becpme popular of recent years yes its anoying but when it first came out it was seen as tacky funny. soon *fingers crossed* this cheep and stupid fab will move on but for now dont look at them lamo . one company sees another companys advertising and if that first company is in profit others copy that advertising and dont forget people are getting dummer and TV is allways trying to apple to the widest base so they try to make the stupidest understand as the more intelegent usualy have their mind already made up.

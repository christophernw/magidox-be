Numerous studies have shown that too much caffeine interferes with sleep patterns, but the long term health effects of the drug are more controversial. Some scientists claim that daily caffeine stimulation increases our risk of high blood pressure and heart disease later in life.. . To the researchers surprise, both drinks had the same effect on the non-coffee drinkers, stimulating the sympathetic nervous system and raising blood pressure. . . So I say there is no purpose! drink away what you like better!!!!!

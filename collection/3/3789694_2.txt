that is all abuse none of that is discipline .... . how could you even ask a question like that ??. .  that is sad :(  do you know someone being abused >>??? knowing about it and  doing nothing makes you just as apart of it :(. .  if someone is at the point they are shaking a child they need to leave the situation ,,,, they should walk away before it leads to that ,,,,,

why are some people attracted to so-called "good". There are multiple reasons why someone would be attracted to what one would call "evil" it could be the fact that that is all they have ever found comfort in, or it could be someone trying to rebelling out of hurt and/or boredom. Or it could be the simple fact that they just are. Also it is human nature to want what we cannot have. Doing bad things also pumps adrenaline, which is quiet a pleasing feeling.  But always remember evil and good are in the eyes of the beholder

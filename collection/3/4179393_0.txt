Well. . . 'natural fears'. . . We're only born with the fear of falling and the fear of loud noises, and i think that fear stays with us until we die. But other fears are taught to us (knowledge).. . We are born with instincts, but we can learn how to control them.. . And with self esteem. . . I think knoledge can both harm and help our self esteem.. . I dunno if that helped at all, but thats just what came to mind.

It's usually lobbying by your congressmen that gets the military bases. But maybe the strategic location of the state has some bearing as well. However, a lot of bases have been closed since the cold war ended.  It seems like the military is grouping  their resources into huge complexes rather than having the expense of maintaining a lot of small bases around the country.  I really don't know, it's an opinion.  I'm on the east coast and my state has a lot of bases and people from closed bases will be arriving here shortly, so our military population is going up.

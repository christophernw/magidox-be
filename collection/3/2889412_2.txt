Amway actually sells a product... so it doesn't really qualify as a 'pyramid' scheme... I have been to an AMWAY recruiting seminar and those folks are very persuasive... they show off the trappings of wealth and tell you how easy it will be for you to get rich and lots of people get hooked... almost like a religious cult.

hey look out for the other cultures, like Spanish speaking people give us alot of our moves too. and white folk help us put that rock and violin into our hip-hop, but we are just gifted in areas like music. it's a very important part of our culture. so we are always up on something. and we are a happy people, comedians at heart i think sometimes, so we are creative and we come up with things. God created us that way, so love it!

Babies are actually born premature because the human body cannot tolerate the growth in the womb.  The true gestational period for a baby to mature is approximately 18 months.  Because of this, babies are born with immature brain development and other characteristics such as undeveloped eye pigments.  The pigments can take up to a year to form.  Actually, the eyes are brain tissue and an extension of the neural network.  . . It's all very fascinating!  . . :)

Jesus was a Jew. His disciples & apostles were Jews. The first believers (& converts) in the Messiah were Jews. The followers of His Way were a Jewish sect..... . By the 4th century, a lot of false prophets and heresies had been introduced to some of the believers. Emperor Constantine (a pagan until his death bed baptism) co-opted the religion for his own mammon & empire. Pope Sylvester was his puppet and made Constantine's decrees Catholic Church doctrine.. . The Reformation set out to fix the wrongs in the Catholic Church, but they failed - they kept a lot of Constantine's heresies (desecrate the Sabbath and make Sunday, "the venerable day of the sun god," the holy day of rest & worship, the pagan-based Christmas & Easter schedules & practices).. . So, True Christianity as Jesus taught was Jewish - with the belief in the fulfillment of the Suffering Savior (and that He would return to earth as the Victor). The mainstream Christian denominations are just pagan practices with Judeo-Christian elements - but God does not like His worship mixed with paganism.. . The Messiah was Torah-observant, Sabbath-observant, ate only clean food (no scavenger delicacies), etc. He loves God the Father (& you & me) with all His heart, all His soul, all His mind, & all His strength. You should do the same.

First off it is unclear that the comment was directed at the nations youth. It was more likely a comment to politicians that "if you don't study the situation and do your homework, you will be stuck in Iraq". . . However, unlike our current commander n chief; Kerry served his country in Vietnam with many young soldiers that had less than a high school education and knows first hand what it is like for them. Scared and really not understanding the reason they are fighting. Having some republican blowhard tell them they are fighting for freedom. As brave and good soldiers they do their job. Most of the soldiers today in Iraq are no different than those of the Vietnam era; yes some whom were reservists before activation are older and educated and may actually have fought in other battles themselves. These men share their battle field together and I'm sure that they are not insulted by Kerry's comments.. . Is Kerry the ideal candidate? Was Bush? what is important here is to get the republicans out of office before they can get another puppet to play with!. . Kerry can serve as the stooge also as long as we get honest democrats to take the place of Cheeny , Rumsfeld and the rest!. . VOTE DEMOCRAT!

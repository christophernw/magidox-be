Definitely grind the spices yourself in a pestle and mortar.  Don't forget key ingredients like fresh ginger, garlic and chilli to add depth.  I think the key to curry is longevity, so invest your time early in the day (or day before with proper refrigeration)  preparing and simmering your sauce.  If your meat is lamb or beef, cook it slowly within the sauce to enhance the flavour.  With chicken or seafood, spend time on your sauce and drop the protein in for the last 10-15 mins to keep the moisture and succulence. Add thickness with yoghurt, coconut, or spinach depending on curry.  Always fry onions until brown, adding salt and sugar at the start to give a caramelised quality .  Enjoy!

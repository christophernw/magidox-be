They would rather cut taxes to the rich... I mean America is more than capable of having no poverty, based on how many trillions are made... but greed rules all in America... they hide behind reasons like "they are just lazy," but when people say this, all they are doing is showing their ignorance of the problem of poverty... those who are not in poverty have no idea and don't care to know.... Caring for the poor and taking care of the poor is one of the basic foundations of the teachings of Jesus, yet many who claim to be Christian have no care or concern for those in poverty... and in truth  have no concern for Christianity or the tenants it is founded on.... A "Christian Republican" is an oxymoron the majority of the time... in my opinion

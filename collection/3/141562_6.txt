1. Draw a line.. 2. Draw a perpendicular (Draw two circles whose centers are on the line and which intersect in two points. The line passing through those two points is perpendicular to the first line).. 3. We will bisect the angle Pi/2. Construct another circle of the same radius as half the line segment between the two points of intersection with center at the intersection of the two lines. Construct another circle of that radius with center on the intersection between the circumference of this circle and the line. . 4. Connect the point of intersection between the perpendicular and our initial line to one of the two points of intersection between the 2 circles of step 3. We now have a right triangle with legs of equal length, so the acute angle is 45 degrees.. 5. Adjust your compass to the length of the hypotenuse and draw a circle centered on the intersection of our initial line and the 45-degree line.. 6. Construct a parallel to the 45-degree segment (in a manner similar to step 3 or through any other method) at the intersection of the new circle and the initial line. . 7. Connect the last two endpoints to form the rhombus.

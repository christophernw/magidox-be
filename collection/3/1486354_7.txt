I would say Atheism (ignorance is only bliss for a while) but... well yeah, that wouldn't be a religion now would it?. . So, I would probably have to go with Neo-pagans (a horribly general category, I know). Take the Asatru, for example. According to Norse Mythology, snow flakes are the shattered bodies of giants that Thor has killed, and their bodies will fertilize the soil. Every claim at a fact can be (and has been) disproven. How do they get around this? By picking and choosing those myths that they believe (and wholly inventing others). At least other religions have age on their side; even if you think that Christianity or Islam is based on myths, at least you can't say that the current living believers were the ones to make them up.

Please explain how in Hell you got the idea that the Bible approves incest from those scriptures. . However, the Roman catholic church attempted to use incest to develope a super race after being so successful with Jesus. That is why members of the clergy are called brothers and sisters. The concept did produce genius, but it produced so many retards that the Church finally abandoned the practice.

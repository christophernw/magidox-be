Do you have photos of the damage?. . My husband had an incident last year. It was his fault, but I happened to have my camera with me, so we took pictures of it.. The people kept calling saying it was $600. My husband told them to have it fixed and we will reimburse them for the bill. They wanted the money, and we refused. They never contacted us again. . . We were lucky, but we think they jacked it up thinking we would pay for the damage. The photos would have been good proof in court, because there just wan't much damage.

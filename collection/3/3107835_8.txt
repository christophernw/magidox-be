I think Some dogs are afraid and some hear things and they don't know what they are or they hear things they don't understand.. It seems like some dogs bark when they hear another dog bark too. . The other night I was outside and it was very quiet. No dogs were barking. My dog barked one bark and another in the distance barked one bark. I guess dogs were sleeping good that night. Not a creature was stirring.

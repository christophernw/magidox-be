In my experience, many immigrants don't want to go to the hospital for fear of deportation (which wouldn't happen) or simply because they don't speak the language.  Think of how you might feel in a country where you don't speak the language and you are sick..so much information would get lost in trying to understand what everyone is saying!  Hospitals scare people anyway, the language barrier makes it worse.. And, by the by, I have noticed that more Americans don't pay their hospital bills..the "illegal immigrants" are the ones on the phone trying to set up payment plans.

An area of most modern homes in the U.S. called a bathroom is a good place to start. Within this bathroom is usually a tub that will accomodate a person for rituals commonly called showers. This is a good place to wash your butt. If you might notice that the itching goes away when you shower even just twice a week. As long as you keep fair hygiene your butt shouldn't itch. If you keep having itching issues, see a doctor.

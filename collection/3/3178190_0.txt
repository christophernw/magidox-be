Quabalah or Cabalah or Kaballah (however you wanna spell it) is a belief system that originated with the ancient Hebrews.  There is so much involved in this system that it is impossible to give an adequate description here.  But if you are interested,  try looking up "Tree of Life" and "The Bible Code."

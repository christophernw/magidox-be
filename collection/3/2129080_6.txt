The gravitational force is not instantaneous!  The graviational affect moves at the speed of light.  Picture this:. . A trampoline with a bowling ball, which represents the Sun, at the center.  The ball will create an indention.  Now imagine a marble, which is the Earth, caught in that indention, so it is moving along the curve in a circle.  If the bowling was removed from the trampoline, it would take a small amount of time for the trampoline to smooth out.. . That is what would happen if the Earth were to vanish.  The space-time fabric would smooth out, and that smoothing would emanate from the Sun at the speed of light.

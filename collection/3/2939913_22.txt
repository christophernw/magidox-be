Do you think adultery is a sin? How about incest.....or paedophilia? They are behavioural choices....the same as homosexuality is! Notice that of ALL these sexual sins, homosexuals are the ONLY ones who try to claim they were BORN that way.....talk about not wanting to take responsibility for your actions! It's as much of a choice as all other sin!

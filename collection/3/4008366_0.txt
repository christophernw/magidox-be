Well you have to do a thing saying "In conclusion" or "All in all" or "As I have stated earlier" and so on.  Or if you started your introduction with a question,(I find it much easier to write conclusions when I start the intro with a question, besides, it catches the intended readers interest) then you state your points and have a brief explanation.  The ending sentance should be able to close it easily with the reader satisfied with your answer.  I hope this helped!

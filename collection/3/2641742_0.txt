Medical "professionals" give away antidepressants a lot because putting somebody on drugs is quicker and easier than actually trying to solve their problem.  Depression does often involve chemical imbalances in the brain, and medication helps many people who suffer from depression.  But much depression is caused by life circumstances, and medication can't fix your life.  But if the doctor just hands out a pill, then it becomes a "quick fix" and they don't really have to deal with the problem.

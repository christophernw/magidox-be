Best way is to cut out all sugar. Read labels lot of thing have sugar and disguise it, like cane juice. Cut back on carbs, no refined white flour. The best thing to eat is green vegs. and protein. If you don't already exercise take up running or walking to get your heart rate up. It is not healthy to lose more that 2 pounds a week, but being over weight is not healthy either. Best of luck

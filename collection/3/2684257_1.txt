If you are a LICENSED real estate agent and are affiliated with a real estate broker/agency, then you should not have much problem establishing yourself.  If you are not licensed or you are not associated with a broker, make sure you check the laws in your state.  Most states require you to be licensed and be under supervision of a real estate broker.

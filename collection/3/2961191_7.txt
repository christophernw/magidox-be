Ogopogo is a legendary sea monster which is supposed to live in  Lake Okanagan which runs for 80 miles from Vernon to Penticton in  the fruit belt of southern B.C., Canada. People have reported many sightings of it and there are several pictures of the sightings. I lived in Vernon B.C. three years ago and a team of scientists from  ( I think ) Japan were were living on a boat on the lake doing research and hoping to catch some film footage of Ogopogo.  Some believe that it really does exist and may be a mutation of some large fish species or a creature that has not fully evolved from the prehistoric days. People travel to the area from around the world hoping to catch a glimpse of it.  I added some web sites that might interest to you.  The first site in the list is photo's of ogopogo. Hope you enjoy them.. . http://images.google.ca/images?q=Ogopogo&hl=en&lr=&sa=X&oi=images&ct=title. . http://www.tourcanada.com/ogopogo.htm. . http://www.vtours.com/kelowna/ogopogo.htm. . http://collections.ic.gc.ca/ogopogo/. . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogopogo. . http://collections.ic.gc.ca/ogopogo/legend/legend.html

I'll venture a guess----your homework is in a subject that you dislike intensely.  Just the thought of doing it is nerve-racking.  Five minutes of this is just too long, and you'd rather be cleaning the toilet than doing this work.  . . "What will I ever use this subject for?" you ask yourself, "and is school as important as everyone seems to think it is?  Do I even care if I pass or fail?". . Well...just tell yourself that you have to do the work, get off the computer, and do it!  I know this sounds hard, but it can be done!  I used to get headaches when I had to take algebra--but nevertheless, I knew I had to do it, so I did.. . Good luck with your homework.  :)

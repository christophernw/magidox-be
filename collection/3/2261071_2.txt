Epistemology is the philosophy of knowledge. It's about how we know things; why we know them; and what it's possible to know.. . It tries to answer questions like: What does "I just know it." actually mean? What's the distinction between reasoning to an answer and percieving it? What's the difference between knowing something abstractly, and knowing it by doing it?. . The wikipedia page linked to has a more detailed (but more technical in parts!) analysis of what epistemology involves.

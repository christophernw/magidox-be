Look in you manual you got when you purchased the car fore the location. It may not be a serviceable transmission and if not there is no dip stick. If it is a service transmission the it will have a dip stick similar to the engine oil stick but shorter and will likely have a red or yellow ball or square headed on the top of the dip stick, it will likely be located near the front of the transmission or at the rear of the transmission, look for the red or yellow ball or square headed dip stick.

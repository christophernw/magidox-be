That is almost as ignorant as asking why the African-American community would be upset if someone wrote a pack of lies about Martin Luther King, Jr. and passed it off as truth.  (Something that would NEVER be allowed to be published, by the way.)  But insult Jesus and/or the Catholic Church and it is "Freedom of Speech" or some other justification.. . Dan Brown did an injustice to ALL of Christianity, not just the Catholic Church.  For that alone, he should be banned from ever using a typewriter again.

Full-wave rectify 60 Hz to get 120 Hz ripple, couple it through a large capacitor to block DC, then low-pass filter with a series L/shunt-C circuit to remove most of the harmonics. You'll have to size the L-C to clean up the waveform adequately without losing too much of the 120 Hz. Or you can apply it to a 120 Hz tank circuit per above answer, but depending on the loading you apply it still may need some cleanup.

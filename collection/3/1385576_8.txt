200 years ago in England 'fat woman' would be the ultimate compliment implying you have royal connections. - even royal can mean a fat person.  So the current popular view of a woman is a skinny bean pole and this view is also probably wrong too. So 'fat lass' currently is offensive in popular culture.. but don't forget Dawn French and the many fat bands out there.

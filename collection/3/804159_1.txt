Sharon,. . Holiness, for us, properly means devoted or separated to God.. . When we are devoted or separated to God we will act like Him and do what pleases Him. Often when we say that God is holy, we focus on the fact that He has no sin or evil attitude or motivation. We often overlook the fact that He is good, and He does good, or that He is love, and He acts with love as His motive. For Christians, righteousness, and also maturity, can also be expressed basically as “love in action” or action with love as our motive. . . For Christians, holiness is expressing God’s love or agape love. It is not just an understanding or feeling of agape love, but the tangible expression of agape love. (i.e.: Loving God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength and loving our neighbor as ourselves cannot be done in a vacuum. It must be expressed through acts of obedience to God and service to our fellow man, or it is not real love, and it means nothing.). . God bless.

a study was conducted on rats and what the researchers did was get the rats fat then starve them for a month, they lost weight, then the rats could eat as much as they wanted they got even fatter again, now the researchers starved them and the rats lost weight but not as much as the first time, then again the rats could eat as much as they wanted and then they were starved again, this time the rats didnt lose as much weight and they were heavier. What is going. on?? im not too sure however the fat cells  have a memeory and each time they r starved they remember to store more next time, it has to do with leptin and other responses from the fat cell, but basically u have yo yo dietied and your body is gonna make it harder for you to lose weight and keep it off it does not sound good but im sure if you seek good advice and are patient and change what you previously did good results can be achieved

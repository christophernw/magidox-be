Knowing what ingredients are including in the product and whether or not any of these ingredients may be potentially harmful (cause side effects), also figuring out whether or not the cost of a product is worth it or if the consumer (that would be the person buying the product) should be buying a cheaper brand name (if they would be getting the same or near the same value for their money)...this can also be applied to products sold in bulk and whether or not the consumer is actually saving money in buying the bulk product rather than the regular product or more than one of the regular product.. . Also included in consumer awareness is how advertising and marketing is used in attracting a consumers' interest.  The consumer must look very carefully at any advertising to distinguish what kind of strategy the company is using and whether or not it is false advertising...also the consumer must be aware of how marketing is used in shopping centers and stores in order to attract a consumers' attention to a particular product.

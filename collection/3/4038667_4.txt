Truly, your cat is just trying to stop you, to get your attention. He/She is saying "Helll-ooo.... worship me!"  Seriously. He/She just wants you to say something nice, give 'em a scratch, and move on. My advice : Show 'em the love. Eventually, your cat should not wait until walk by, because they'll be happy to follow you around.

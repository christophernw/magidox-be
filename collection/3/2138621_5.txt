Good question.  As long as it's within marriage, there are no rules.  (Except of course, you can't bring other people or animals into the equation). According to the bible, God says this:. Heb 13:4 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed UNDEFILED: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. . . Again, undefiled, meaning that there are no restrictions.. . God created sex and wanted man and wife to enjoy themselves.  He even speaks against spouses who don't want to have sex.  . 1 Corin 7:. 1 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. . 2 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. . 3 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. . 4 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. . 5 DEFRAUD ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. . . What this is saying is that it is part of your marital duties to have sex.  If you don't, you might cause the other to look for sex outside of marriage.  . You should enjoy each other and have as much sex as possible.. . As far as learning how, I agree with the others who said open communication, councellors, etc.  Porn doesn't teach anything...remember, they are actors, entertainers, not sex experts.

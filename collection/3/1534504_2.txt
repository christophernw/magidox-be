it doesn't remain constant.. well it does if you take into consideration the momentum that is gained by the air molecules when sound is produced when the objects colide plus the momentum gained by the molecules when it's tempreture rises due to the heat produced form the collision..etc.... . so... . momentum of objects + molecules + etc... BEFORE collision. . is. . equal to. . momentum of object + molecules + etc... AFTER collision

First of all you probably won't know that Australia as a country is famous for holding over 90% of the world's opal. Coober Pedy is Australia's most famous opal mining town. It is located far inland in the state of South Australia, which is "the driest state in the driest country on Earth." This makes it not as surprising to hear that its inhabitants live mainly underground. Of course, many people upon hearing stuff like "underground in dugout caves" immediately think of Coober Pedy as a place with very primitive homes and people that were never influenced by modern civilization. This not true in the least. In fact, Coober Pedy's appearance considering its location, shows the fact that it is part of a very well-developed country. Try measuring exactly how remote the town is as well as the natural conditions of the area, and then if you see how the inhabitants of a similar area in, say, Northern Africa live then it'll be clear how Coober Pedy is very "civilized."

coz the resume contains data only in a typical way that goes the same for almost all applicants and it does not indicate or give an idea about the personality of the applicant which is usually seen through the elegance of the cover letter, the way it is organized, the presentation of ideas, the confidence beyond the lines... and much more. besides a cover letter gives the applicant a chance to include details he could not mention in the resume as well as any remarks he would like to add.

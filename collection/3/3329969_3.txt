In the Bible it states "let Us make man in Our image."  This is a wonderful thing, but He also gave us free will.  Each person makes their own choice if they want to kill or not...and by the way, THAT knowledge wasn't available until Adam and Eve decided...by free will...to eat of the tree of knowledge which God specifically told them not to do.

By being a good CEO.. . Any CEO worth his salary will focus on R = MV (margin X velocity).. . Read Ram Charan's What the CEO wants you to know, you will then understand everything about business.. . Business is perhaps the only way to become a billionaire (although Warren Buffett seems to be the exception: he didn't "create" any business, he just placed capital where it would have the highest return over a long period of time).. . But back to R = MV. This equation simply means you've got to create value, and then be able to deliver that value to one billion customers (if you charge $1 to each customer, then you are technically a billionaire).. . Of course, reaching one billion customers is tough. So sometimes, a company will try to motivate customers to go out and reach MORE customers.. . This is the brilliant idea behind Hotmail, which the two founders sold to Microsoft for 200 million dollars. Hotmail users have email signature that encouraged email recipients to sign up at Hotmail. Brilliant, really.... . Back to your question.. . "Why would I become a billionaire?" is perhaps a better question, more motivating too.. . Billionaire Charlie Munger always wanted to become financially independent so he could do what he wanted in life.. . What's your reason?. . If your reason is powerful enough, it might not be that hard to achieve your financial goals.. . Good lucK!

About 4-billion years ago, when Earth was in the final stages of forming, it was one immense sphere of molten material. Over time, Earth began to cool from the surface inward. At the same time, the planet's heaviest elements sunk towards the still molten core; some of those elements were radioactive. Today, Earth's mostly-molten core has a high temperature for two main reasons: (1)radioactivity; (2)pressure of all the material squeezing inward against it.

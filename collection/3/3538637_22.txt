That depends on if you believe in God's world or not. I believe that things do happen for a reason and I'm not the one to figure  out why they happen. Sometimes bad things do happen and that is not God's will because people are living their will not God's. Like killing, rape, etc. that is not God's will. If someone is living God's will, it will be his will not mine. I really do mean that. Living life honesty and helpfully will most likely bring peace of mind and happiness. Just my opinion.

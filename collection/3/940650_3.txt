The irrationality of people not believing in evolution (or believing in Religion in general) has a scientific basis. It goes back to our cave man days when man was very insecure living in a hostile environment. The cerebral cortex of our brain (the complex thinking apparatus) is a relatively recent addition.. . The more primitive underlying limbic system, the seat of our ancient emotions or innate temperaments, is in all of us. Humans use both systems. In times of trouble, people still pray for intervention by the god(s). Prayers are requests by persons to have the laws of the universe repealed in their favor.  Belief in creationism (as opposed to evolution) is to believe that the laws of the universe don't exist even in the face of overwelming evidence.. . People who are rational, relying on their cerebral cortex, look at all the absurdities in religion. Christian dogma expects people to believe the fairy tale of Noah's ark, although it is patently impossible to squeeze even samples of billions of the world's animals into one small ark. Rational persons consider such stories ludicrous.. . The bible account of the creation of man and the universe is in such contradiction to irrefutable facts that a rational person cannot help but laugh about such fantasies.. . Have you heard the saying "there's no atheists in foxholes?" Its because in times of danger, humans revert to the primitive part of their brain for security. We needed religion to survive in a hostile universe back in the cave man days. Now, in the modern era, we can see all the absurdities of the varius religions....but, obsolete genes do not disappear overnight, and so you will be seeing people "who don't believe in evolution."

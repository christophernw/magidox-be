Wart remover from the drug store probably won't work very well.  A doctor (most likely a dermatologist) would have equipment or supplies for different kinds of cautery methods (burning off warts).  There's chemical cautery, heat cautery, freeze cautery, and laser cautery.  Your best bet is one of these.

I totally agree with you. . But (how lame) tobacco is not governed under the same rules as food.  All foods, liquids, have to be marketed and sold under a strict standard to maintain public safety .  . . If it is not pasteurized, it is not fit for sale.  If someone chooses to consume their cows milk, fine, but it cannot be sold until 'decontaminated' (lol).  I wonder what would happen to smokes if they were decontaminated.. they would cease to exist for sure!

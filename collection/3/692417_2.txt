I had many ways to cope, many of them weren't very good, but I also talked with people who were going through the same thing. I would try to forget about the bad things that I have done, and if people bring them up I tell them that I'm trying to forget that part of my past, and if they could help me that'd be great. You just need some friends that know what you are going through. Good luck, don't do anything drastic.

The whole dealers can turn the CEL on or off bit is dumb and false.. . Most MIL codes are for actual/serious problems with your vehicle. If your car is brand new, no matter if they are willing to fix it or etc, I would return the vehicle. There may be a serious underlying problem that can be patched and come to haunt you later on.

First of all you're only 12 what do you know about being a racist. You have a lot of growing up to do, you haven't even seen half of what the world has coming for you. You will come across white people who dislike their own race so do you call them racist too or it's only when Black people dislike White people. Have you ever been to Alabama ? I guess, not because if you have you will see that it is the most racist place ever. Most of the White people there hate Black people with a passion.So, before you ask another question like that you should research the topic of racism in depth detail.  Racist people are not born a racist they are taught to be ignorance and closed minded about other races. I have one question for you is your mother and father racist?. . Have you ever heard to Social Darwinism. Charles Darwin had the quote that says, "survival of the fittest." This meant only the people who had everything were the only people to survive. To put it into something that maybe east for you to understand is, there are two giraffes one with a long neck and one with a short neck try to retrieve leaves from a tall tree.  However, the giraffe with the long neck gets all the food because he can reach the leave while the giraffe with the short neck can not get any food so it dies. His statement caused racism among all races. Even the White race.

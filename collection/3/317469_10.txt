Everyone always says that ProActive works so I think it's worth trying.. . As for oily skin:  Kiehl's makes high quality skin care products.  They have a website.  Kiehl's Rare-Earth Oatmeal Milk Facial Cleanser #1 works really well.  You massage it in, leave it on for a few minutes then wash it off.  It's been the best product I used so far for oiliness because it doesn't irritate my skin or leave it red and flaky.  A 4oz bottle is $12 (a little expensive if you don't like it) but it's worth trying.

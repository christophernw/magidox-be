It is very common for an established cat to begin marking when a new cat is brought into the household.  Is your older cat neutered?  If so, make sure you clean up all markings with an enzyme cleaner, and use a pheremone product like feliway.  This will help, also, do you have multiple litter boxes?  The basic rule is one for every cat plus one.  So, for two cats, you would need three boxes.  It may be necessary to discipline you cat for the marking behavior.  Try a squirt bottle or loud noise to distract him if you catch him, but no matter what, do not do anything that may make him associate the litter box with punishment.  ( for instance, grabbing him and forcing him to the box)  this will only compound the problem.  Good luck.

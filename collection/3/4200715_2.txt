try a cleanse like the one below.  pimples are often the result of built up toxicity in the body.  your body tries to release those toxins through your skin, and viola, you get acne!  you could also have a candida overgrowth situation, which would accelerate your body's toxicity.  in anycase, appropriate internal cleansing helps many people with skin problems.. . http://www.fast4health.com

Good Question that I have asked many times.. I believe it is against the Fire Codes in all areas of the country.. The only thing I could ever think off was control in a robbery (Slowing down the robber going out).. But again, it could be to control movement of large bulky items to prevent theft or a means to slow down a rush to the inside by customers.

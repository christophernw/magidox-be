You can't say that global warming 'hurts the animals' because the statement is too vague. Some animals will suffer and have difficulty surviving because the new environment (after global warming) will not be as good for them as the current one. Others, however, may do better in the new world and their numbers will go up because they are better able to survive and reproduce. The concern, of course, is that humans may find it difficult to survive - imagine a world where food supply becomes even more erratic than it is now!

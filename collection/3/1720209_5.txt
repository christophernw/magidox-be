You will need to get both ends of the tape out of the cassette so that you can make the repair.  There is a small button you can push to "open" the tape just like your VCR does.  Once you have the tape drawn from the cassette, make sure both ends are smooth and have no wrinkles in them.  You may have to cut off some tape to get to the good part.  Then using a good quality adhesive tape, put the ends together and apply the adhesive tape.  Then, turn the video tape over, and tape the other side as well.  You will notice a little 'blip' when this sections plays, but the rest of the tape will be fine.

Every body is different and therefore responds to different things. You probably don't see a noticable difference in your weight because muscle weighs more than fat. You may be losing fat, but you are gaining muscle by working out, and therefore remaining at a steady weight. As for finding it difficult to stay below 2000 calories, you should think about your diet and how to eat more efficiently. For example, you could be wasting 300 calories on a bagel for breakfast when you could be using those calories by eating more of something with less calories, like fruit or whole wheat toast. That way, you are getting the same amount of calories you would have eaten with that one bagel, but now you can feel fuller because you can eat more.. . Remember, everyone is different and these are things that worked for me. Happy eating!

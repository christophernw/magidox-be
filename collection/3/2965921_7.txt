Going to redlne on your bike will not hurt it. Todays bikes are designed to be run to redline. It is the maximum engine speed the manufacturer has set for the engine you have a rev limiter that will keep you from doing any damage. most bikes make their peak power before redline so shift when you bike stops pulling the hardest. The reason they are like this is so you can hold a gear in a corner without shifting or bumping the rev. limiter. Go to any sportbike race and you will hear almost all of them hitting the rev. limiter. On the back strech at road atl. you can hear spies and mladin hitting it from just before the kink and all the way through it.

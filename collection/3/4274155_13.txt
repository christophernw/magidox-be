They're at the bottom because you are torturing them.  . . Goldfish need at least 10 gallons per fish since they produce a lot of ammonia in their waste.  They can get up to a foot in length and when properly taken cared of, live for 20 years.. . They require a strong filter and a side surface area since they are surface breathers.  . . You need to get those two babies at least a 20g tank and put flowers in that vase.  Would you want to be kept confined in a tiny vase with no oxygen flow, lots of ammonia, and no place to move around in?  I thought not.

I think you have to separate the practicing doctors and the non-practicing doctors such as "hilot". Or some medical who allow themselves to do an abortion.  In cases for the  practicing doctors who perform abortions, well there are many cases of abortions and before they do it to the patient they observe bio medical ethics, so they are not then to be jailed but those who perform abortion out of the medical jurisdiction, well they are to be jailed.

Many of the previous answers are wrong, particularly about the contents of sweat.. Sweat is an odorless liquid, mainly water containing urea (as in urine) and salts (much the same as blood).. Our kidneys automatically adjust the balance of salts and water. When there is too much water our urine is dilute. When water is short, urine becomes very concentrated and urination infrequent. We feel thirsty.. We get all the salts we need from our food (probably too much) and any extra is excreted by the kidneys into urine.. After sweating a lot, it is the loss of water that is most important to replace. However, in extreme cases the salt loss can be dangerous.. The idea behind 'sports drinks' is to replace some of the lost salts, which they market as electrolytes and call the drinks 'isotonic', i.e. the same concentration of salts as in blood. Normally you would soon replace salts by eating.. To make the drink attractive, flavourings are added and sugars too. They are strange colours.. Tap water is much cheaper.

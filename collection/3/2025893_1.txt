If you are talking about a computer virus--my thoughts are that they are  are very bored, intelligent people out there. They have nothing to do but try to show they have some kind of intelligence that is destructive. They are aggressive people with the only way they can attack is to do it through computers, and unsuspecting people that really care about trying to communicate. So all you Attacking virus people-we will talk, don't attack us.

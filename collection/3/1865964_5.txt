kind of hard to explain, regular fats are either saturated or unsaturated.  to be saturated (to keep things simple) you have a long chain of carbon atoms all bonded together and with two hydrogen atoms bonded to each carbon.  in unsaturated, you have the carbon chain but not all of them have two hydrogens, in place of a hydrogen the carbons will have a double bond with the next carbon.  so, when they hydrogenate fats, they pump hydrogen gas through the fats to make the hydrogen bond to the carbons.  so basically they are trying to saturate it so that there are two hydrogens to each carbon.  this is done to make an unsaturated fat saturated.  however, with the conformation of the molecule, it is not the same shape and properties as saturated fats and therefore is worse for the body because it can't be broken down as easily as the other fats.  hope this made sense, i do much better explaining this if i can draw it out LOL

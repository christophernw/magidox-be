Tricky!. Ask to be sent a copy of the photographs that were taken of you speeding. If its not clearly visible who was driving and you have some lovely person in your life with no points on their licence tell the police it wasn't you driving and let them take your points!. Also, check if the 40mph signs are clearly visible - if they're not then you could get out of it that way. . Not sure about online solicitors but be wary!

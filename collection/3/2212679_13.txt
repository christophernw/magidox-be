Two reasons I would say:. . A - It's the christian's fault, they were acting according to their own will and not God's, and hurt people, and then people hurt them back.. . B - They act according to God's will, and a lot of people don't like people who think, like Christ, that the narrow road is the only one.( The Bible does, in fact, say that everyone is on their way to hell unless they trust in Christ to save them, and there are many other truths that people don't like to hear, homosexuality is wrong, ect). . People hated Christ, and his disciples so much that Jesus Himself was killed, (but ressurected), and all his disciples, later apostles, with 2 exceptions, were martyed. Christ predicted that christians would suffer persesution. But they suffer a lot more persecution in other countries, especially Islamic onces where its lawful to kill people for changing religions from Islam to christianity.

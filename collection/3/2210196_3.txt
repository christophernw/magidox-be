find a picture that you want on google or if you already have one on your computer, open it up so it is on the screen and left click  on the picture and you should see a list of options in the middle you should see save as background. double click on that. If it is a small image on google it may not have very good resolution so it may come up in four of the same pictures connected as your background. in this case just try another picture.. . If you are using windows xp your system comes with a picture of a dog. to see this picture open control panel> appearance and themes> Display> desktop (tab)> and about 3/4 of the way up on the scroll bar below the picture of the monitor you should see a label called "friend" highlight that by clicking on it and then click apply in the bottom right of that box. Hope this helps!

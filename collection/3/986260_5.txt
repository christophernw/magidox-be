Currently?  I take it that you were dropped off of the mailing list....  tell me where you left off and I'll try and fill you in.  In the meantime PAY YOUR FEES!. Just kidding.  The meaning of life.  Imagine existence with the best view of it's opposite, being non-existence.  Without any existence, or any sentience to percieve anything, then there would be no point.  No existence, no purpose.  Therefore the meaning of life must be life itself.

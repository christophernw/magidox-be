publicity, advertising, writings, images, money, talk shows, books, articles and more -- of all these influences us and affect our thinking. Including radio, TV., Internet etc. I have no solution on how to resist -- but all this information and mis-information and mass information -- is too much already for my tiny brain. Conflicting news, psychological news affecting my well being and the way I feel -- all play their role...the next question you should ask is how do we protect ourselves against such an unlimited on slow of news and information. The subject is interesting and unlimited. Hope it helps a tiny bit in your thinking. and the answer is of course "yes".

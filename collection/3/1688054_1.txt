What I would refer you do is when you start the book, picture in your mind the places and people that are being described. Usually writers tend to describe the areas and characters to a 't'. You can mentally picture what you think the scene and people look like, whether it be close to a person you know or a place you are familiar with-so to keep in mind of what that person and place looks like.. Then you may get more interested because you have visioned who, what and where you are reading.

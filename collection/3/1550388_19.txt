It was right after World War 1,called the Treaty of Versailles, which required Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Turkey Empire to give up lots of land. Germany also had to pay the allies (Britain, France,and America) an unspecified amount of money which would be determined by how much they could pay.  The German military had to be disarmed and Germany was not allowed into the League of Nations for the time being. Many other things were included in the treaty of Versailles but these were the important points. Basically, in the 1920's America's economy began to boom as well as France's and Britain's. However, Germany's economy,as well as Japan's, was going the other direction. Soon people got desperate in these two countries and looked for a leader that could bring them out of this depression. Hitler rose out of Germany, because he was a war hero. Hitler believed in militarism and soon "took over" the government. He blamed the downfall of the economy on everyone who wasn't christian, because he was. In World War 1, Hitler was sure that Germany was going to win; when they failed he was shocked and decided to blame it on somebody besides himself (it wasn't his fault, however). The Jews just happened to be in the group that wasn't christian and since it was easy to raid the synagogues and figure out who the Jews were, they were an easy target.

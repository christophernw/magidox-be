Most laboratory mice are hybrids of different subspecies, most commonly of Mus musculus domesticus and Mus musculus musculus. Laboratory mice are often white, and some are albinos. Many (but not all) laboratory strains are inbred, so as to make them genetically almost identical. The different strains are identified with short letter-digit combinations; for instance, the strain whose genome was sequenced in 2002 (see below) is C57BL/6J.

Racism does not only work one way!!! It can work anyway and towards any race. As for only white zones in the uk this is all just your opinion of some places. There are a few horrible people in this country that do horrible unacceptable things like taking machete's to inocent members of the public. But don't just write off whole communities! There are some very rough places in this country where terrible crimes happen, but there are also many upper middleclass suburbs where even nastier things happen, open your eyes and see the bigger picture, open you mind and see how you are encouraging a negative view on anyone who feels they are a victim of prejudice.

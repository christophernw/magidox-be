Here are a few ideas you might like to consider - make it into santas grotto with a christmas tree, fairy lights etc. and put out christmas books and maybe a cd or cassette player with headphones to listen to christmas music/stories OR cover back and sides with white material, attach cut out snowflakes and footprints to make winter wonderland, collage a snowman together and get children to bring in soft toys from home that live in cold countries, polar bears, pinguins etc.have hats, scarves and gloves for dress up OR if your setting has christian values make into into a nativity scene - a stable is easy, throw some straw on the floor, have a baby in a bed of straw, have soft animals or collage/paint some and have dress up stuff for mary/joseph/angels/kshepherd and kings (make crowns).

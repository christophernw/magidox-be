I think that bad body image is very common among most girls and women in the U.S...and I agree w/ that other person: since so many people DO complain, even if she doesn't actually think there's something that bad about her body she complains anyways (maybe as a way to seem modest or maybe she's digging for "are u kidding u ahve a great body!")...all of which will enable her to fit-in better (in her mind), ick.. . But I know, it pisses me off when someone so obviously has a fabulous body and complains to you...when you've got a good 30 lbs. over them and it's all packed on your hips.  Just kinda want to smack 'em sometimes, you know?

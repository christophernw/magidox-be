I guess because it looks more feminine, & suppose to fit our body frames the best...Well...That doesn't work for me...I'm a thick girl, & I like my big watches...Actually, I'm wearing a men's Guess watch right now...I love it, & wouldn't dare trade it in for some tiny lil' watch...that's just not me...I could also like men's watches b/c I'm a lesbian...I dunno...lol....

We still do not know exactly how general anesthesia works, but modern neuroscientific research has at least suggested a number of plausible hypotheses. The most commonly accepted theory is that general anesthetics operate directly on the central nervous system to temporarily inhibit synaptic transmission (the chemical means by which neural impulses are transmitted between adjacent neurons). This results in a general loss of consciousness that affects sensory awareness in all modalities and at all body loci.. . Beyond this general statement, one "nonspecific" theory holds that anesthetics impair the operation of the sodium pump, preventing depolarization of postsynaptic neurons. A more recent "dual-process model" suggests that anesthetics simultaneously inhibit the actions of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and acetylcholine and enhance the actions of inhibitory neurotransmitters such as GABA and glycine. The specific physiological mechanism by which anesthesia is achieved probably differs for each different class of anesthetic agents.

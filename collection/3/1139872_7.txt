evertying is about tming. for many changes to take place humanity had to progress to the certain point. You can't make change right the way it won't work. If for generations ppl belived something it ain't happening overnight.. Look at the religious ppl they still thin k GOD glue the stars and made moon is the light, and they do really belive that all those ppl that GOD killed was for greater good.

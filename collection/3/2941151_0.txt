The word has to do with being honorable and behaving in a moral way, and being concerned about justice and fairness in all one's decisions and actions.. . Think about examples from your own life where people have shown rectitude - done the right thing, even though it was tempting to do something else, and write about that and draw a picture about it.. . Good luck with it.

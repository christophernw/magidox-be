In my opinion, the rest of the world thinks extremely badly of all Americans. . . They do not like the fact that the government feels free to invade any country they want and impose their system of democracy (Iraq). . . Then, they are ignorant, thinking the American way is the only way, when in reality countries hate America even more since their economy does not even compare to America.. . You would hate the smartest and richest person in at your workplace or in class if they were constantly telling you their way is the best, and did not even consider your side of the story.

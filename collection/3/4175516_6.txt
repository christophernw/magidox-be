Well you don't cure it but you don't need to wear thick glasses all the time.  I had one since I was  2 I wore bottlecap glasses til about 11 I begged for contacts and I guess the direct contact strengthened the muscle in the eye that was weak, because ever since the first day i wore contacts I can still control the eye with no support from glassses or contacts.  My vision still isn't worth a shit , its improved though.

It is the process of all the good gooey topping in the bottom of the pan, (sugar, butter,  pineapples....etc.) and letting it cook up around the cake batter this also allows the sugar and other ing. to melt together without running off the cake.  and after it is done you let it cool then flip the pan and all the toppings that were on the bottom are now on top..............ummmmm ummmmmm good !

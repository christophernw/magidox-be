GOOD one. . . Human Being definies what we are as in species. ALL creatures are "beings". We just happen to be a being of the human variety. Being human is a concept we came up with along the way to try and set some sort of guideline on how to treat each other. Still working on that one but geez, was only a couple hundred years ago we were stepping over dead bodies in some of the FINEST cities in Europe so Id say slow progress is better than none.

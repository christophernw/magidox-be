actually we (as native americans) believe that we were put here by the creator/god. then the english, spanish, french came to our world/land/country and colonized it to their satisfaction. stealing & killing to get what they wanted for themselves. so others seen what was happening and then all were coming into our land. as history has it...we were reduced in population due to disease, mobs, bounty hunters, etc...basically treated like animals hunted for sport/trophies/rewards. so in my opinion everyone else should be illeagal aliens except native americans.

I think that humans are animals, but we are unusual animals in that we are self aware, and able to communicate this self awareness to other  humans.  Maybe other animals are able to communicate self awareness to others of their species, but at least at this time, humans can't prove that animals have this ability.. . One aspect of our self awareness is that we know that our lives will end.  One role of religion is to come to terms with this knowledge.  I find it hard to think that my thoughts, knowledge, insights, and consciousness will cease to exist.  I'd like to believe that some essence my life continues to exist after death - in spite of all evidence to the contrary.  That's were religion creates stories to reassure ourselves that the death isn't the end - whether it be reincarnation, resurrection, life in heaven, whatever.

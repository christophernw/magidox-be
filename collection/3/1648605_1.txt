you can buy a spl meeter, sound pressure level meeter at radio shack, not very exp.. determine what your ratings are via labels on speakers and measure that with spl meeter. If you are not reaching the specs, more amplifier power may be required. some speakers are more efficient than others based on the power handleing capabillities, and more power than said requirments is ussualy better!

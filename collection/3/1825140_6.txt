You can't force him to stop but you can let him know how much he means to you and how much you hate the smoking.   I have 2 friends that both quit by taking Zyban for a short period of time and neither one of them has ever touched a cigarette in years.  And neither of them ever went through the bad withdrawals that some people deal with. And how about letting him read these messages?  If he knows it's that important to you, maybe it will give him the motivation he needs.

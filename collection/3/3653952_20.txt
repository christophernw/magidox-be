I would not be against someone who waves the confederate flag.. But it has nothing to do with race.. Most people think of the civil war as being about slavery, but the south didn't see it that way.  They saw it as being about the rights of each state to make their own laws.  The laws just happened to be about slavery.  The north took the position that the federal government could make laws affecting the whole nation, while the south said that each state must decide for themselves.. So if you look at modern day issues, like, for example, abortion, then the souths position would be that each state would have to decide if they want to legalize abortion, but the north would say that the US congress would decide for everyone.. So people who wave the confederate flag are usually saying that they support "states rights".. But a lot of times, if someone who is african american makes a fuss over it, then those people will start making racist comments just to pick on you.  You really don't have anything to worry about.

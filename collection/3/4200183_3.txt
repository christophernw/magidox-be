You can either try to work a part time as an assistant in the kind of job you are looking for or.... You can lie and say you do have experience.  This is what most people do anyway.  Its not good to lie, but sometimes, employers expectations are not realistic.  If you do feel you are ready to do the job, you´ll find out that experience involves all what you didn´t learn in school.

It would be nice to live in a world where homosexuality was the norm and "straight"/hetereosexual were insulting terms. Why are you straight? Your question shows that you are selfish and immature. If your brother was in the hospital would you be there for him? If he was arrested, would you show up to bail him out? Would you help him out if he needed it? Why should it matter who he likes? You dont have to understand his choices, i am sure he hasn't understood some of yours. The real question is Are YOU  his brother or not? Because if you cant get over yourself and accept him for who he is or you will lose him pretty fast.

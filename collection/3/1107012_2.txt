This is the title of a movie by Alfred Hitchcock...directionally, north by northwest doesn't mean a thing.  . . The title North by Northwest refers to a compass direction that does not exist (the correct term is "North-northwest").  North-northwest on a compass is at 337.50Â°.. . What these directions are called on the compass can be found in this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_the_compass

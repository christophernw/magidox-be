The hypothesis is what you are testing.  It is the original idea you believe happens in the real world.  Then you conduct the experiment to see if it holds up.  So the hypothesis technically has a huge effect on the results, since the result is to prove/disprove that hypothesis.. . For example, if you wanted to prove what a particular chemical was, you wouldn't throw a rock at a pane of glass to see if it breaks.  Because that would have nothing to do with what you are trying to prove.  You would look for another chemical you could mix with the first chemical to see the reaction and see if it would mix with the first chemical a certain way (that would prove it is that chemical).  So your result from the first experiment would be broken glass (which you would not find since you didn't conduct that experiment), and the result from the second experiment would be a chemical reaction (which you would do to prove it), thus you've changed the result based on your original hypothesis.

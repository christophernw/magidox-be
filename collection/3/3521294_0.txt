I am not sure that Nokia shops will help, But yes local cyber cafes do allow u. There are also many local photo shops that will burn Cds for u. It should be between 100-150 INR ie 2-3 euros.. Also in case u dont find suitable place to get ur cds burned, then go to cybercafes and upload ur photos on snapfish or yahoo photos.. . If u get a reliance internet cafe that will be best cause the provide the best internet speed.

HIV is a virus that attacks your immune system. That is it attacks your body's ability to cure other diseases. Therefore, most people who have AIDS don't die out of the symdrome itself, but out of other diseases. Their body can't fight them.. Up until now, most medicines don't actually do the healing themselves: They help your body's immune system kill the disease. If the disease kills the immune system, there is nothing for the medicine to help. Think of the medicine like guns and the immune system like an army. If the army has very few men, the guns have to be very very sophisticated to kill the other army (the disease). We haven't yet found medicines sophisticated enough.. Up until now, these were the cold hard facts.. The rest is speculation.. Another reason is economical. Medical copmanies and hospitals get huge amounts of money from people who have AIDS and rely for decades on the current medicines, which don't cure the patients' lives, they just prolong them. If they found a cure, then patients would just take it and then that's it. That's why they don't fund research adequately enough for scientists to find a proper cure.

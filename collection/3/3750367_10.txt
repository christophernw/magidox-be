I'm a nurse who worked in mental health up until a few months ago, I'm always sitting here thinking "oh G-d, no don't tell them to do that." The advice is horrific sometimes, I think people who suffer mental health problems give pretty good answers bit in the end you have to remember every case is different, even though the symptoms sound the same.. . Of course some people are still embarrassed and might feel this is the only place they can come.

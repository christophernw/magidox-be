Some occupations will allow children to work as young as 16 but alot of them will not hire anyone younger than 18..   Child  labor laws and OSHA  mandate these limitations..    Being a bus person may be one of those situations where your daughter may be employable but places like Pizza Hut,Taco Bell,MacDonalds,Burger King etc would probably be her best bet.

inkjet printers use liquid ink and place droplets of ink on the paper.  this then takes time to dry and smudges easily, and the image wiil run should the paper get wet.. . laser printers use a dry powdered toner and burn the image onto paper.  since the image is burned onto the paper, it does not smudge, or run.. . the inkjet is usually much less expensive to own and operate, however can be much higher in price per printed page.  laser machines are much more costly to own and toners can be outrageous in price.  these however make up for it in qty of pages printed for each toner.. . i run an hp color laserjet 4650 printer.  it is about $3000 to buy and each toner (one per color) usually costs about $200.  so if all my colors are empty (magenta, cyan, yellow and black), and need replaced, i can look at spending close to $1000.  they will give me between 6000-8000 pages.. . i had previously owned a lexmark 3200 inkjet printer.  it cost me $179 brand new and the cartridges run about $35 each (one black and one tri color).  they averaged 275 sheets per.  when replacing the two carts at once it was less than $100.  275 pages later, i'd spend the $100 again and so on.. . lasers are my preference as you can see they require much less ink maintenence.  and their price per printed page is much less, so i find i do not feel guilty printing more.. . sorry i went on and on.. hope this helps

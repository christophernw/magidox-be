Since I don't know exactly what type of school it is or where, I'd go up to the school when it is not in session either on weekends or after the regular day and I'd play with my child on the playground.  I'd try to make the school as familiar a place as possible so when you have to make the transition the child will be familiar with the building and the equipment.. . In addition, if you can gain access to the building ask the principal or school counselor for a tour.. . Lastly, I'd play "school" at home with your child, sometimes with them as the teacher and sometimes with you as the teacher and see how your child responds and reacts in the different roles.. . Good luck.

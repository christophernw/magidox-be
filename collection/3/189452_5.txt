It's not going to be easy. First treat the girl. Get some stuff from the pharmacy or your doctor. Before she goes to sleep or even comes in the house, let her stay with a baby sitter at some relatives house, not a friend (later).    Make sure she's had the treatment using clean or new brushes, combs, toss out the old ones. Get rid of all her berets, binders etc. everything. Cleanup time.. .    Wash all her her clothes, pillow cases, etc, all her coats, hats, everything she wears, wash in hot water,.    You take a treatment, yes, you, the other kids, and their linens.. .    Your daughter will have to stop seeing some of her friends or tell their parents, fight time of course, they;ll blame you etc. back and forth.. .    Clean, wash the carpets in her room at least. Have you ever seen one of these monsters, under a microscope, no of course not. They are as evil looking as death itself, you'd clean good if you saw one.. .    That's what you have to do Honey, clean, wash with hot water good, inform friends, relatives, ets. Start over. If she has real long hair, cut it short, that will help greatly but, do it yourself and watch for it, it has eggs glued to the hair that can spread. Good luck.

Other countries wouldn't call them anything.... they'd be deported, jailed or shot.  Apparently, if enough people break the law.... it's not illegal anymore.  What a load of sh*t!!!  I wouldn't let some stranger wander into my house and eat my food, would you!?  So how is the situation with the illegals any different?  Isn't this our home?  Don't we pay for everything through taxes?  Why is this type of home invasion okay?

Humans are afraid of what they don't understand. Personally i am not afraid of death and the reason for that is I am no stranger to death. My brother died when I was 7, he was only 14 when he passed. My sister committed suicide when she was 28/ I at the time was 19. So with said i feel like what ever happens I will be OK and at last be reunited with my siblings.

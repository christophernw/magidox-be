I remember hearing a story about meat boxes.. I did a google search and found an interesting web site.. . The following is lifted from the site:. ______________. The prevailing theory is that Uncle Sam was named after Samuel Wilson.. . During the War of 1812, Wilson was in the business of slaughtering and packing meat. He provided large shipments of meat to the US Army, in barrels that were stamped with the initials "U.S." Supposedly, someone who saw the "U.S." stamp suggested -- perhaps as a joke -- that the initials stood for "Uncle Sam" Wilson. The suggestion that the meat shipments came from "Uncle Sam" led to the idea that Uncle Sam symbolized the federal government.. . ____________. . I'm sure that is only one of many theories.

I think you have it backwards.  Jesus is trying to say that the Pharisees should not be so uptight about handwashing.  They had it right on the not killing children part, but they demand strict adherence to this ritual law.  That is what Jesus was against.  The rule of "let he who is without sin cast the first stone" most certainly applies to the case with children who do not honor their parents.. . Look, I'm not a Christian and have no reason to defend the New Testament.  However, an objective look at these verses will tell you that you are wrong in your interpretation.  There are other things to argue about if you want to "corner" Christianity.  But I don't see this as one of them at all.

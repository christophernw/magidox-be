First of all it is called Methamphetamine, it is a highly addictive drug that is very easy to make and cheap to buy.  It makes you up all the time, not want to sleep nor eat.  It dehydrates you, causes memory loss, loss of vision, temper tantrums, uncontrolled rage and some ppl will do anything to get the drug.  Get this, Adolph Hitler was a meth addict!  So do yourself a favor and stay away from it!. . Ether, ephedrine, Muriatic acid and lord knows what else.  It is a pain killer, and an anti-depressant and lord know what else.  But it is a chemical poison.  The worst way to use it is to smoke it, it is also the most addictive.  . . Meth is so easy to get, you would be surprised who is using it.  We have police officer's who have suddenly lost (in 6 to 8 weeks or less) 20, 40 or more pounds!  A postal employee was fired for possession, a deputy county attorney was busted for buying meth.  So it is all over.

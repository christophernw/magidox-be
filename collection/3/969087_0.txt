sorry to tell you dear but after a certain point in the pregnancy you don't. but i found that you can try the always famous on your side with a pillow between your legs for support, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. i found that sitting slightly up and propping your head up isn't very comfortable but u are able to breathe and you do sleep and it's not like you won't be able to sleep once the baby comes and CONGRATULATIONS!!!!

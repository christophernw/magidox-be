A more intriguing question as far as I`m concerned would be "Why do people smoke".. I know many smokers and everyone of them wishes they hadn`t started, many have tried to stop, and failed, and of course none of them have benefited from smoking, neither financially or health wise.. So my advise to you young people who don`t smoke yet, don`t start. I don`t smoke, and am very glad I don`t.

Maybe you can make your costume contest into a modeling contest, the reason being there may be a lack of participation/costumes to judge from. By providing the costumes, you can actively involve the audience while describing the clothes in detail with historical knowledge and stuff. Of course, the judging does not need to be very serious or objective. Good luck with your renaissance fair, and have fun!

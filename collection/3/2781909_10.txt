over 50 years ago, traveling by train was "the thing" to do.  back then, you had many different railroads running passenger trains all over the place, so it was easy to get a train somewhere.  the airplane was improved, and the railroads shut down and merged with each other in the 60's and early 70's, and amtrak became the only major passenger railroad in america.  the airplanes improved, and amtrak got worse.  in europe, the trains improved too, and any train you take out there is electrified and high speed.  in america, the trains became ignored and didn't improve with the airplane.  now, people prefer airplane because it is faster and better.  if, and i emphasize if, america ever reaches europe in railroads, the train will probably start to become more popular.

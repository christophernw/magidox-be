You mean this world?. . Well, Adam as and Eve ra, put us here :-). . We live in this world with PURPOSE. It's a good question you have come up with. It is, WHY.. . All that I can say and put to you is, the world we live in today is a place that will NOT last forever. When there is a beginning, there is an ending.. . While you're on Earth, this world, live WISELY. We stay in this world just for a very short while but if you have FAITH in the AfterLife, that'll be ETERNITY.. . So, why we live in this World, is not a question and we mustn't question why God put us all here. Be Good and choose the RIGHTEOUS religion that will guide you to safety here on Earth and the AfterLife.

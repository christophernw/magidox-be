I left high school at 16 to run away from home and see the world and I have no real regrets about it. I was a misfit and had a hard time socially and I needed to get away. You can talk about it untill you are blue in the face and nothing will change. Eventually I got a GED. I might have done better in the job market, but I would've been miserable all my life so there is no question in my mind that it was the right thing to do.

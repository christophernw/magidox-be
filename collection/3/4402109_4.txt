Trust me it is very very bad.  It screwed me over for my entire life.  My mom smoked and I was born with mild but stil is autism.  I love my mom and everything but this I can never forgive her for.  Please please don't smoke during pregnacy.  There is a whole slew of birth defects that could happen.

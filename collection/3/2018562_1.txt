Some dogs howl habitually at noises that are unusual to them.  My black lab used to howl at police sirens - not fire trucks, mind you, just police sirens.  Other than that, he was quiet as a mouse. Even coyotes howling couldn't get him started. . . One expert says, if your dog howls during music, he's just sining along, showing he's part of the "pack".

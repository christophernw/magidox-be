Get him one of those scratching posts to scratch in.  Keep him in a room different from the room with the leather couch.  Reward the kitten for scratching the scratching posts and verbally punish him (i.e. say "No" in an angry voice) for scratching the leather immediately after the leather couch.  The cat just needs to file down its claws.

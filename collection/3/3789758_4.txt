According to the Bible they continued to have sons and daughters. Daughters were taken as wives for centuries until God decreed that a man should stick to one wife (they also had concubines) when a wife could not have children, she could give her handmaiden for this privelige). The old laws were changed as needed. Many were changed by Moses. There came a time and the statement that the law had been fulfilled.. Lots of things had to change over the years. People don't understand the whys and wherefores. Parts of change were do to diseases.. Example digging a hole to deficate in and to cover it up.. Not to touch a dead body If so you were unclean untill dark.. You had to wash by then.. Disease was rampant at times. Cooking came about as needed when the priests fed the people from burnt offerings, they of course ate first.. Get your Bible out and read it. All this came from it.. Want to understand what you read?

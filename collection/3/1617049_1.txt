The last poster was correct in saying that cirrostratus clouds usually cause this effect.  Cirrostratus clouds are made mostly of ice crystals.  These crystals form in different configurations depending on temperature.  Certain arrangements act in the same way as prisms.. Cirrostratus clouds are mostly associated with the approaching of a warm front.

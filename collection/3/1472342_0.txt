The Sacrament of Reconciliation is in place for us to be forgiven of our sins, the priest who hears your offenses was put here by Christ himself when He gave the keys to Peter and told him "what he holds bound here on earth will also be held bound in Heaven..." the priest forgives through Christ within him.As for believing in it... I have to say I do because in general people feel better when they talk about their wrongs to get it off their chest so to speak and I think that was ingrained into us by God.

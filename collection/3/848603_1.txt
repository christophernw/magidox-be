ATP & ADP, and even AMP, (Adenosine Triphosphate, diphosphate, an monophosphate) are the energy currency of many eucaryotic and procaryotic cells. Many important series of cellular reactions use these workhorse compounds to capture energy during metabolic and photosynthetic processes and to transport and expend energy in other cellular processes. The high bond energy of the chemical bonds that attach the phosphate groups to the molecule provide a convenient and almost universal means of energy storage and transport.

A lot of time people believe they love, but what they believe is love is infact selfishness. People play with other people lives saying  they love, but they intimidate, abuse, accuse and dominate others in the name of love.. Real love is when you put others before your own self. Real love is not hurtful, it is not dominating, it is kindness, gentleness, compassionate.. Real love will stand long sufferings, it will endure all in all. Most times we can't see love because we have been so hurt from it that all we feel is pain and we wonder what is really love. When we learn to love God's way then and only then we will be able to see and experience that feeling called LOVE.

First of all, women represent aproximately 50% of the possible suspects here folks.

My point is, as far as playing a number's game, we can't really know who is getting the supposed raw end here.

Understanding what each author is working with, and what sociological structures inform his writing helps us grasp what a particular work is trying to do.

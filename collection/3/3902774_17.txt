another one for cherie blair and co ,what right do criminals have to obtain ILLEGAL substances in prison does the m.o. have to contact the local pusher . Its ridiculous the cabinet should sack the home office civil servant involved and as this particular case was settled out of court send Lord FAlconer to the High Court for a ruling ,an illegal act cannot be seen as a right .This precedent means that junkies on the outside have the same rights as inside so drugs are now legal.

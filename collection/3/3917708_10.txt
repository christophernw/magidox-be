Mr. Flasch!!!! omg he was the worst teacher!! ok like he did not teach at all! all he did was mess around and talk about nothing and all this dumb a$s sh_it... i failed that class bad this year(i just had his class this past year)... like when he teaches, it dont feel like hes teaching so then u just tune him out and do something else... and then i failed.. and it just always felt like all we did was watch movies and it was always so boring for me becuz he never taught the damn class!! u'd think it'd be fun having a goof off teacher but it really isnt once u have it. him and Mr. Mitchell... i never did a thing in gym class and i goofed off all the time and talked and all that shizz and then when i would go up to him to tell him i didnt wanna even change for class, he'd let me and i'd just sit around and watch with my friends... and then i find out that im getting an A in the class.. so i asked him about it and just smiled and said "You're a good student, Felicia. One of my favorites." and it was so gross, i almost died.. but i past the class and never had to do anything... but it was still gross everytime he'd look at me and smile.. i'd get chills and go home and take a shower cuz he made me feel gross lol

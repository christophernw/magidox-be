What was your level of belief, when you began to pray as suggested? . . You are trying to do something that you do not wholly believe, and there is nothing wrong with that.  that is why it didn't work.  . . Rather than rely on the techniques of others, make your own questions, ask in your own words.  What do you really want?  . . God is wiser than the world believes.  "Heaven" is not a place, but your true state of being.  God is not a separate deity, but everything that you are in truth.  You never left "heaven".  . . It is impossible that God could deny you anything, for then "He" would be denying Himself, because God created the truth of you by "becoming" you, through a perfect, beautiful, inner act.  You are literally created of God.  . . Never give up.  You will find what you seek.

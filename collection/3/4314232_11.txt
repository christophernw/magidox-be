I'd like to see the people who wrote the story, approved the story, and the source hammered big time.. . There are a lot of things done by the government covertly that 'might' be used in the wrong way. Now IF the NYT did find out about such an action I might be in favor of them writing a story on that particular act. But even then the specifics should be left out.. . There things that go bump in the night. We depend on government to prevent them from happening and bump back when necessary. Nothing is done in government that isn't approved and monitored somewhere. . . IF the NYT wants to hammer something that's going to be approved by Congress, talk about the people that are for it and why the program is wrong. That's fine with me. IF the NYT want's to accuse Congress for not monitoring programs enough and letting them get out of hand. That's fine with me too.. . One thing is certain. Terrorist will NEVER bomb the NYT. They would be ruining their best source of intel. So yeah, something should be done about all the leaks and those who print them. Let's start with the leaks. Anyone know where we can find a good plumber?

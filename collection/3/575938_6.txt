Because my Dad doesn't know how to use the Internet for starters, and the other is because people have a lack of imagination.. My dad always knows how to ask the perfect questions to make me come up with my own answers - . Once...when I was BAWLING over a broken heart and he felt it was time for me to "get over him" he came into my room and asked to promise him that I would not cry at his funeral and said to me he never wanted to hurt me as much as this young man had done...."I looked up at him strangely - and I said I can promise you that".........it made sense to me how to put life into prospective.

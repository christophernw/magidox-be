You could put your baby in a stroller at any age! Just be sure to have the RIGHT STROLLER for the RIGHT AGE.. Here's what I mean:. . [x] Newborn-6 months: Get a nice, big, COMFORTABLE stroller for your baby. Newborns haven't yet gained enough muscles in their neck to hold their head up all the way. So be sure to pick a stroller with a neck/head supporter. You want your baby to be snug in the stroller so he/she cannot move around or wiggle their way out of their comfortable position. That could be dangerous for this age.. . [x] 6 months- 12 months: Almost any stroller could work for this age. Your baby will be strong enough to keep their bodies in the right position and will most likely be able to keep their head up. Though, I recommend a nice, stable and always a comfortable stroller. It will work very well on their new bodies.. . [x] Toddlers - young children: They will need nothing more than your basic $20-$50 stroller. Walking is best for toddlers. They need that exersize to grow strong. But if they need to remain close to you in a crowded area, I suggest one of these strollers. Unless you are not worried about price... the more expensive, the higher quality your stroller will be.. . [x] Children: Putting children older than 5 in a stroller isn't such a good idea. They REALLY NEED their exersize so they can grow and grow STRONG. You don't want a lazy, non-active child when their bodies are developing.. . I hope this helps you make your decision!

Sun burn is when the skin and usually the underlying tissues become burned. A sun tan is a mild burn. Think of it like baking bread. When the bread goes in the oven it becomes brown and this is the desired result, if left in the oven for too long the bread will burn. Skin acts just like any other kind of animal tissue. It will become very red and sensitive and then blister, then cause all sorts of unsightly scaring if left for too long.

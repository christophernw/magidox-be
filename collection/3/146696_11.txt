A scared guinea pig makes really high pitched squeaking while being picked up. They run away. Some may bite but it is very, very rare. I have had over 40 guinea pigs and I've not once been bitten by one. . . A happy guinea pig will squeak for food, make little squeaky noises while being petted, will take food from your hand.. . Liz - a happy or unhappy guinea pig will relieve itself anywhere and everywhere, by the way. They don't just have one spot where they poop and pee!. . Oh and bill_the_cockroach..... guinea pigs don't have tails so that would be kinda hard!!??

I don't know exactly but I think that countries where "soft" drugs are legal, there crime rate is lower. Just as thing s like where there are no age restrictions on alcohol or lower legal ages for sex, they have less problems related to these things in those countries. You can't rebel if there is nothing to rebel against. That's my theory anyway.

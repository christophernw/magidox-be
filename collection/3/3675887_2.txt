Jesus foretold for our day this work:"This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations;and then the end will come."He also instructed his followers:"Go....an make disciples of people of all the nations."-Matt.24:14;28:19.. When Jesus sent out his early disciples,he directed them to go to the homes of the people.(Matt.10:7,11-13)The apostle Paul said regarding his ministry:"I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house."-Acts20:20,21;see also Acts 5:42.. The message that the Witnesses proclaim involves the lives of people;they want to be careful to miss no one.(Zeph.2:2,3).Their calls are motivated by love -first for God,also for their neighbour.. . A conference of religious leaders in Spain noted this:. "Perhaps [the churches] are excessively neglectful about that which precisely constitutes the greatest preoccupation of the Witnesses-the home visit,which comes within the apostolic methodology of the primitive church.While the churches, on not a few occasions, limit themselves to constructing their temples, ringing their bells to attract the people and to preaching inside their places of worship,[the witnesses]follow the apostolic tactic of going from house to house and of taking advantage of every occasion to witness"-El Catolicismo,Bogota,Colombia,September 14,1975,p.14.. . I might just add had they not kept coming,I would never have found the Truth of God's Word.I was a very disillusioned catholic and just didn't know where to find the truth about the Bible and what Jehovah requires of his worshippers.I have been a Witness for 10 years now.And even though many feel as you do,there are those out there like myself that are searching for the truth and are waiting for Jehovah to answer their prayer.This work will only stop when Jehovahs says so

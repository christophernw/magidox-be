that lorentz factor strikes again. this time with time. t'=t/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2). t' is the time observed by a stationary observer, t is the time that passes for the object moving at high speeds. so as v goes up, t goes down, so less time passes for the object moving at high speeds. this is negligable and only effects anything if the object is moving really fast, at least like 90-95% the speed of light to observe any real difference.. . anyway, so the twin paradox is basically that you take one twin and make them go at almost the speed of light, like 99% the speed of light.  according to einstein's theory of relativity, time would go slower for the high velocity twin, and therefore that twin would age more slowly. so if that twin was gone for like 5 years, their other twin aged like 20 years or something(the exact amount would depend on exactly how fast they were going.)  and by the way, these lorentz transformation formulas are definately right, ive had to derive them in class to prove them...

Salt is carried into the oceans by the rivers that flow into it from land.  The river water absorbs salt from the rocks and minerals in the earth; the amount in the river water is small, so the water is not salty, but once it gets into the ocean the salt accumulates.  When ocean water evaporates back into the atmosphere, the salts stay behind and accumulate.  It takes thousands of years to build up to the present concentration, but it is still going on.

You may just be one of the lucky ones. At least you can have a hope of taking some medicine. As for me, NOTHING --> I mean NOTHING works. I tried everything, hot showers, heating pads, exercise, pain killers, birth control, everything!!! Nothing works for me and my periods are SO painful to the point I can't even stand up. So take some medicine it may help you.

If none of the above works (I am most skeptical about ear candling) then try tilting the head of your bed so that you sleep on a slant. Get the head of your bed up at least 6 inches. Your symptoms could be due to esophageal reflux during sleep, which can sensitize your vocal cords and bronchial tubes the next day.. . If your cough is worst in the morning this is likely the culprit.. . And of course if you smoke, QUIT.

Back in college, my friends used to tease me that I reminded them of POLITENESS MAN, from the National Lampoon magazine's comic section. When someone did something impolite he would hit the offender over the head with a stainless steel hankie and then correct the inappropriateness.. . For instance, when an escaped felon woke up the judge who had convicted him and the judge didn't remember the felon's name, Politeness Man instructed the judge to pretend to know the intruder's name and then try to get the name through polite conversation. The judge was shot 37 times.

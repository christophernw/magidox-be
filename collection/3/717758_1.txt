Get the "frequent gambler" card for the hotel where you gamble.  When you gamble at a table game for a while, ask for the pit boss and ask for a comped meal.  Most times, if you have gambled at the table for a while, they will give it to you, or at least something.  But if you don't ask, you usually don't get it.  And the worst they can say is no.

A film which could have been a flop has become a blockbuster by the hype created. In fact  many in the world do not know much about Jesus personal life etc as presented/understood by the christians and those non christians would have viewed the film like any other film and also know it is based on some fiction and would not have carried home any thoughts on it. Now people want to go and see the film, some buying the book to read it and then even compare it with the bible etc.. A WIDE PUBLICITY STUNT. ARE YOU PART OF THE STUNT

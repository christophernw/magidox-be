There was this method that is spread around that you listen for the sound the thunder and then start counting from 1 onwards until you hear the next thunder sound. The greater the number, the further it is from you, and the smaller the number the closer it is to you.. . But this above method holds no merit, and the only way I know of (and I took several courses in meteorology in University) is to use special equipment to gage the weather conditions and electrical charge of the land.

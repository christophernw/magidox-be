Please talk to your doctor.  Oh, but you probably have.  We can give you moral support and well intended suggestions, but serious questions re panic attacks, ask your doctor. . .  OK here is my extremely non-professional advice - see if you can laugh about what you think may be causing the panic attacks?   Hopefully someone else can give you something more helpful.

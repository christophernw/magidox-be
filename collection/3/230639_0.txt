There are always underlying subconscious forces that influence your conscious mind. You are simple unaware of them (usually) whilst you are awake. Dreams bring these subconscious themes to the foreground (I suppose mind-altering tools like drugs, hypnosis, or meditation can do this as well). But how we should interpret dreams has always been a subject of controversy.

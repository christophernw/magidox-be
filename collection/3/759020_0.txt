I got this from a perosn who raised doves as a kid,look at the head,if it is bigger it is a male or if it is a female it is a little smaller.The female will usally make a laughing noise.And please don't take your bird to the vet to get it sexxed...Thats how my friend lost his favorite bird*cry*....So if you love your bird lease don't do that!

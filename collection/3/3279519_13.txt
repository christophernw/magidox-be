Find something to do. . Make some friends. . Practice a hobby or something.. Fall in love ;-). Listen to cheerful music!. Talk to someone.. Whatever you do, don't try medications!! been there, done that, got over dosed & felt crappier than ever :-( . Good luck! & always remember, you're not gonna let this damn depression get you!! you're much smarter & stronger than those who let depression get teh best of them.

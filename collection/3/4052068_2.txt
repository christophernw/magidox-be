Gravity, kid. It's all about gravity.. The invisible stuff that keeps us from flying off the face of the earth, what George Lucas calls the Force! :). . Actually, the Earth rotates on it's axit at 1000 miles an hour! It moves in it's orbit around the sun at 67,000 miles an hour! And our sun alone is cruising at 200 kilometers a second, which will take about 240 million years to complete it's grand circuit around our galaxy center! WOW!!!!!. . Since we're going so fast, I guess it's a good thing we have gravity to keep our feet on the ground! It the earth stopped moving and gravity stopped working all together, we'd all fly off so fast we'd be instantly squished!. . Still think the earth isn't moving THAT fast, m3_mY$3Lf_! ???

Insurance companies are structured like casinos in some ways.  They are betting that the incident (death, injury, sickness, etc.) you are insured against will only happen a certain percentage of time, for which the fees they collect will cover the times those incidents do happen.. . Just because an individual might not ever need that insurance, well, never collects on it, does not mean that they did not "need" it, but rather they beat the "odds" of having to use it.

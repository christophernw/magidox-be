My opinion... and it may seem 'far out' to many... is more of a spiritual than a scientific one.. . Seriously... imagine that reincarnation is real for a moment (for those of you who choose not to believe).. . Maybe a soul who's been back to earth a few dozen times as a male and half a dozen times as a female returns again as a female and really wasn't ready to make the transition again... they enjoyed being a male body and therefore, as a female body with a male oriented soul, are attracted to other females.. . Souls can be confused... *shrugs* Wrong body, right time. . . Again... just my opinion. :)

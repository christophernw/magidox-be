Not 'did', try 'does', we're domestic dependent sovereigns, which is why treaties were signed between the US and ratified by the congress, just as nations did.  Not all tribes used the treaty process, however, including mine.  As you know, not all the treaties were kept, however, we did keep our independent governments, etc., although we're in the 'confines' of State boundaries.

Camomile tea will kill two birds with one stone .. the sleep problems and the anxiety.  It makes you feel calm, relaxed and sleepy.  She should have a nice warm bath at night, followed by some camomile tea or some hot chocolate.  She should avoid anything with caffeine.  It's quite right that she shouldn't be taking sleep medication (especially while pregnant) as these can become addictive.. . http://www.freewebs.com/spiritualhealing

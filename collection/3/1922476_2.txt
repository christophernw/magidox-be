If we watch children or older people for a long period objetively, without any bias or predisposition, it will tell us something about their mental ability. But these situations vary so much from one person to another that even long acquiantances will not provide more than a rough basis for judgement. Usaually people disagree with each other in this respect. This is because often without being aware of it their judgement in influenced by many things that are not intellegent at all. In a particular study nursery school teachers differed significantly in ranking fifteen boys in order of their intelligence though both of them ranked the same boy in the first position and the lowest one in the last position.. . Sometimes from the physical apperance and eyes, manners of a person, his intelligence is judged which is not a correcet procedure. For eg: Tom is regarded as intelligent because he has dark big eyes and preety manners while Alex is perceived as dull because he is physically clumsy. But it is to be remembered that a person's cuteness is no index of his level of intelligence.. . judging intelligence only on the basis of behaviour is therefore not  scientific and reliable, though behaviour may be a certain proof of intelligence, it is not always the case since the judgement most of the time is coloured by the judge's own feelings, apprenhensions, biases and prejudices.. . Therefore accurate assessment on intelligence can be made only on the basis of intelligence tests.

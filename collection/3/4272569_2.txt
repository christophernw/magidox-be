Franz Ferdinand alienated many sections of Austro-Hungarian political opinion: Hungarian nationalists opposed his advocacy of universal male suffrage which would undermine Magyar domination in the Hungarian kingdom; both supporters and opponents of the Empire's existing dualist structure were suspicious of his idea for a third Croat-dominated Slav kingdom including Bosnia and Herzegovina as a bulwark against what was perceived in Vienna's Ballhausplatz (Foreign Ministry) as Serbian irredentism; and non-Catholics and anticlericalists were angered by his patronage (April 22, 1900) of the Catholic Schools Association.. .

On June 28, 1914, at approximately 11:00 am, Ferdinand and his wife were killed in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip, a member of Young Bosnia (or perhaps The Black Hand).

Gavrilo Principi was the last of nine individuals sent to Sarajevo for the purpose of assassinating the Archduke. Archduke Ferdinand's death is attributed largely to his hemophilia, rather than any particular marksmanship on Gavrilo Principi's part.

All these answers, and not one Christian thought to look to their own Bible. Do they actually READ the darn thing??. . Gen. 2:15 (KJV)  And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. . . There you have it in a nutshell--God created a purty garden and he just needed someone to take care of it. I supposed he created a big, metal shed with gardening tools, also...I mean, he surely wouldn't have expected Adam to use sticks and rocks.. . Of course, there's also Gen. 1:26, in which God declares that humans are to fill the earth and subdue it. He never says that he wants fellowship with them, or wants to be their friend, or loves them. The word "love" isn't even mentioned until 22 chapters into Genesis--and it's about Abraham loving Isaac!. . So, according to the very first book of the Bible--precisely where you would expect to find the purpose of human existence--God created humans to have a lot of sex, make a lot of babies, dominate the planet, and look after his garden. Well, we're doing the first three, but unfortunately, he destroyed his own garden in the flood, so we can't help him out there.

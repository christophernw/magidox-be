Saddam was seen as a dictorial tyrrant ~ who had close ties with known terrorist.  It was KNOWN that he had at least chemical weapons of mass destruction ~ that he had used against the Kurds.  It wa ssupected that he was developing more ~ and probally did ~ having shipped them to Syria and Jordon before the opening of hostilities.  . . As a consequence ~ the entire Middle East was and is very violatile ~ and it was necessary to eradicate the terriorist threat that the United States had largely ingnored during the Clinton Administration. To do so, it was necsaary to attack terrorism "root core" which was preceived to be based in Iraq, Iran, Syrian, Jordon, Lybia, Chad and other counteries.  . . This has left a 'power vaccumn' in the Middle East which left Iran as the strongest military power ready to exploit it.  This is why Iran is currently seeking to develope its own nuke.  Israel will NEVER permitt this to take place. If the US ~ UN fail to do anything about Iran ~ Israel will.

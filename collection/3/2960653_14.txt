They don't hate Christmas.  But I do agree they want a seperation of church and state.  Kind of a tricky subject.  The country was founded on religous freedom, but when god was inserted into our money, law, etc. the country was only made up of different sects of the Christian faith.. . However, I think that the whole politicaly correct angle liberals have taken for the last two decades has gone to far when they go to Federal courts and have plaques of the ten commandments removed from legal institutions across the country.  . . I am not even Christian, but I know enough to understand that you can't change history, and our country had incorporated many aspects of the Christian faith and morality since its inception.. . I can understand where you are coming from when they now fight to have this removed.  My opinion, as a Hindu, it does not bother me.  Christians, Hindus, Jewish we all have morals of faith that our similar, and I simply hope that these morals remain intact when this country is done ripping religion out of every facet of public/government institutions.

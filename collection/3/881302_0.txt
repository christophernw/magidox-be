Good idea posting your phone number up here for all 5 of us to see. Hows life in the Lab... you little Rocket Scientist.. . Do yourself a favor and call Alltel customer service or 611 on your phone and ask them. . . Oh, and if you get any calls from the Dominican Republic, hang up quickly... they charge about $2,500.00 a minute to connect. . . Have a nice day!

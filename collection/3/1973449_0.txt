Come to think of it, property taxes do kinda suck.  I mean, if you're retired and your house is paid for, you don't want the tax going up just cause your neighborhood suddenly becomes extra-chic.  I guess if you have a kid in a local school that might be a reason to be willing to up the property taxes.  I guess living in CA has kind of turned me off to the idea, seeing as how a house here is like $300K more than anywhere eise.

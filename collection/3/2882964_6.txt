the approximatey of the molecules limits their displacement and increases conductivity.  While observing a wave in water the wave lifts the water and moves it in a full circle and then sets it down where it was lifted.  The movement of the water is the conversion of the wave energy into a different kind of energy called kinetic energy. As we convert the sound into kinetic energy by moving the water it dimishes in power.  In a solid there is no or little room for the displacement of matter there fore the wave maintains much of its original energy as it passes through solid substances.  Not all solids are this way.  Soft spongy flexible solids like dense foam can be quite silencing.  The compresion of tiny air pockes in the foam provides for diffusal of the wave by allowing for molecular displacement.  Because the air is condensed more molecules must be moved as the wave pass trough.

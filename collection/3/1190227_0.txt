Romans 12:1- Consequently I entreat YOU by the compassions of God, brothers, to present YOUR bodies a sacrifice living, holy, acceptable to God, a sacred service with YOUR power of reason..  To present your bodies clean or to worship God with clean heart, mind and body means you can't pollute your body with smoking. God wants you to be healthy and clean in body and worship and thats not possible with smoking.

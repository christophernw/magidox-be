this statement is factually incorrect. israel like any other country has a right to defend itself from terrorists. if the terrorists attack via rockets or bombs and then retreat, like cowards into crowds of civilians then Israel has no choice but to come after them and either kill them (hopefully) or take them prisoner to be tried in front of a democtratic court. the logic of your question would deny the right of the US to attempt to track down osama bin laden in afghanistan, pakistan or whatever stan he may be hiding in.

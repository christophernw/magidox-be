My first week on weight watchers I lost 8 lb, then 3 lb, second week.  I am at 45 lb now.   I began by walking 30 min a day and adding 5 fruits/vege's a day, 6 glasses water, 2 dairy.  There really isn't anything you can't have while doing it, but I avoid eating breads, sweets,  no beef, no alcohol, those things mess with my system.   Good luck, and try the weight watchers, it really has a lot of good healthy things to teach you that will stick for a lifetime.  It is a plan that I can live with, not depriving myself.

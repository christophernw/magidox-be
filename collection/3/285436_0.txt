I think motorcycle would be good if you knew how to ride. Equip it with saddle bags and use a backpack for a back rests. Easy on the gas costs. Wear rain gear if needed. You are on your own and beholden to no one and feel the wind in your face. It gives you a true sense of freedom. Easy to find parking spots and plenty of places now days if you need repairs. FEEL THE ADVENTURE!!!

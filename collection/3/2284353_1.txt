if we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys???  if we evolved from monkeys, why aren't monkeys just spontaneously popping into human beings??  have you ever seen a monkey who was partly evolved, sorta half monkey and half human???i've always had a hard time believing something that does not have any real proof...i'm not saying evolution doesn't happen, i just can't believe we sprung from monkeys when it just doesn't make sense....

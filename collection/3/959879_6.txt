Water will go from the highest point to the lowest point.  So, along the route of a river between source and final destination, if the course seems to gain altitude, it doesn't matter.. . Ever try to drain water out of a fish tank?  Take a hose, completely submerge it into the fish tank.  Then (with your finger over the hole at one end) take that end and put it into a sink at a lower level than the surface of the water level in the tank.  Water will flow up over the side of the tank and down into the sink.  As long as there is mass to push water along and make it flow, it can flow up for awhile.

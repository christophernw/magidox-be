Good Question! When we were a struggling nation fighting the English to become a free nation, the last thing we wanted was another nation (England)trying to tell us how to be and rule our lives. But our government seems to have to be in Iraq so called "Keeping the Peace", I think we should let them fight amounst themselves and learn what it is they need.

Telling people to "burn in hell" is very uncalled for... I see you have no facts.. . The irony is that the hard-core Creationists have painted themselves into a corner. The evidence of evolution is overwhelming... So much so that even the Catholic church is now saying that evolution likely happened. . . With that said, evolution does not disprove the existence of God.

Our spirit never dies so even though our bodies will eventually stop, our spirit continues.  Look at it this way.  What is a thought?  Truly, it comes from within.  No beginning or end because that thought can travel from one to another.  Granted it may have some changes to it but it continues.. . Justice.. Love.. Liberty.. . Though seen as abstract they are still endless and so is our spirit.  It is eternal.  Just think it this way.  You are a member of a family.  Your body lives, interacts, gives, loves, nurtures and then your body dies.  Think about your spirit.  The thought of you will live on.  Your child/ren, grandchild/ren, great-grandchild/ren will keep your spirit and thought going on and on.

Gee, I dunno, why should we bother to tell you.. . Leitch has a great Anthology out on this stuff.. . Butler and Sedgwick would be great selections to read from it to teach YOURSELF these concepts.... . You DO know that critical Theory is a VAST area to cover, right?. . . There is no one or 2 ontological tenets...there are 100s.... . . The scary thing is, you sound like an upper year College student. Why are you NOT reading this yourself???????

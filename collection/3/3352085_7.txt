Oh you are lucky! i would love to find a snake in my house. Hmm, so the best thing to do would be to call an animal specialist to come and remove it. Don't attempt anything yourself. My friend found a snake in his house about 2 years ago lying in the sun by the pool. He called a specialist and after describing the snake, he was told that it is harmless and he could remove it himself. He told them to come because he didn't wanna touch it and when they arrived and saw the snake they told him he was lucky not to have touched it seeing as it was a very dangerous snake. My advice, don't take chances and get it removed asap before you have it's mate and eventually babies living with you!

Stop subsidizing him.  Is he living at home?  Are you paying for everything?  It's easier for them to 'decide' what to do when you are not taking care of them.  Please be sure to make him clean his own bathroom, do his own laundry and cook for himself. 18 yr-olds are capable of this.  He has to make his own decisions, but you have input because you decide how much financial support to give while he is deciding.

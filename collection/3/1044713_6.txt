Ghosts, I have seen one on more than one occasion, I can't explain it in my head.  It scared me, not because it did something, but because I was just scared at the object I was seeing.  I cannot explain it exactly, that is what scares me the most, the lose of words to describe what I saw, it is still in my mind, but words do not seem to be able to tell someone the true story.  All I can say is that I saw a figure that was not full, but the outlined showed a figure, the face was blurred, but the clothes were not.  But it is more than feeling that I had as I saw this thing?  I could even see lines in the clothes, but not on the face.  God, that was the most unreal, unnerving, unbelievable, unforgettable experience, I have ever had. I t happened by accident.  Now I know why people search for any answer for things.

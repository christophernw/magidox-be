because of the puritians and their beliefs...they penetrate the core of this country..... . and because very few people talk about sex in a healthy way and it's treated like it's something dirty and it's not. it's natural and healthy for adults to have sex.  people live what they are taught. if more people were taught that sex is fun and healthy and natural and acceptable behavior for adults to engage in and talk about...that will start to change.

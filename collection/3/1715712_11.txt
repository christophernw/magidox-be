You should try Chamomile teabags (after boiled and rested in your refrigerator for about 15 minutes) on your eyes closed. You get a double anti-inflammatory effect with them, because of the Chamomile and the coldness of the teabags.. Just leave them on your eyes for 10 minutes and put them back on the refrigerator for another 15 minutes and repeat the application, try this in the morning after you wake up and at night before you go to sleep.

Spiritual growth is very importent to me... Because, I want to be so sold-out for Christ! I want Him to be #1 in my life, and I want it to stay that way, and the only way it can stay that way is if I am growing constantly in the Lord... Everyday I need to change something... Everyday I just need to work on something, and I ask God to point it out for me.  So, everyday I am growing closer to my Jesus, and it's awesome... Oh, there are somedays were I slide a little, but I always find my way back up.  God is always there, watching me, guiding me, and loving me...  and if you really want it like i do, then be passionate about Jesus!  Seriously, He died for you... :) . .     God bless!

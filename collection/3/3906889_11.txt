When a modern person says they are "pagan" it usually means that they follow a kind of new-ager-ish religion like Wicca or Druidism (in its modern form) or something similar.  They usually believe in either "Old Gods" like Thor or Zeus or Isis, or they believe in something like a generic God & Goddess that is sort of an amalgamation of all the ancient dieties.  A lot of them will honor gods from many ancient traditions.. . They often also will believe in and practice magick, (spell casting type magic, not stage magic).   Most of them totally reject the validity of any of the major monotheistic religions such a Christianity, Judaism, or Islam.  However, some modern pagans will blend some aspect of one or more of these religions in with their other beliefs.. . If you really want to know what any given self-professed modern pagan believes in, you would have to ask them, because there is a wide variety of beliefs and practices and many pagans that have unique ideas all their own.. . Quite a few pagans tend to hold beliefs regarding sex and relationships that are diametrically opposed to those of most Christians.  There are quite a few pagans that believe that sex is not only NOT sinful but that it is holy and magical.. . There are tons of web-sites that deal with all sorts of modern pagan beliefs.

i believe these are all stories developed to simply make you a better person , I think we can all agree the majority of the bible is unbelievable, for example noahs ark , there is no possible way you can fit all those animals on 1 boat or even 50 boats , but it all comes down to stories that develop you to be a better person . Everybody is so serious about religions but if you truly believe in a "god" of anyshape or form then "god" just wants you to be a good person

I am not quite sure I know what you are asking exactly, but I am assuming that you mean what could cause braces to not be affectiven and help teeth.  if someone misses an appt with the orthodontist, and dont get their rubberbands or use them, or dont get the wires switched out (each time you go and they switch the wire, it's a different gauge of thickness and it causes the teeth to get pulled closer and closer together everytime.  If they dont go do that, the braces wont work, and after the braces are off, if the person doesnt wear their retainer at all, the braces were a waste completely because the retainer coaxes their them together every night.

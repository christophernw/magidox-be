there is a product call fix a flat and there is another one called slime you can get it at any autoparts store..  before you go out and buy any of that you need to check to see where the slow leak is coming from by using a spray bottle of soapy water first spray the the bed and look for bubbles.  . if it is coming from the bead of the tire ( where the tire and rim meet) then you will have to get the tire remounted

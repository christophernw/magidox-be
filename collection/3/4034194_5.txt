Where you breath in the smoke of someone who is smoking near you for example if you were with a friend who was sat next to your smoking then you qwould be breathing it in also just not directly and thats why it is called passive/second hand smoking! It is harmfull to health too so be careful how much time you spend in smoky places - bars/clubs etc

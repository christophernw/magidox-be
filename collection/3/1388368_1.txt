Try singing up for myspace.com there are tons of clubs and club promoters on there. Just message a club's myspace page and ask them what to do. It's also a great place to advertise for you own club. You could find someone to talk to on there about how they did it, that's the best way. You could also ask to help so you would know how to set up your own!

There are two brands of mexican beer that are real nice and are above the others: LEON and XX Ambar. Both of them are dark beers. LEON is made by Cervecver√≠a Modelo, which produces Corona and Pacifico among others. XX Ambar is the dark version of the wide known XX lager(green bottles). Is produced by Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma, which produces Tecate and Carta Blanca.. Both LEON and XX Ambar have great body and a superior taste. Not heavy at all and have no gross side effects.. The worst mexican beer? SUPERIOR (Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma) Don't you dare to try it!!!

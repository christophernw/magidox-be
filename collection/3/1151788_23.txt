Lack of birth control.. A good portion of hispanics are catholic and the church condenms any kind of birth control. . my mom was taught that if you used it, the devil was going to take you. that's small town thinking for ya.. i have a big family, very stereotypical :), but they're all successful, law abiding citizens. big family's are fun. personally, i wouldn't want to have big family, too expensive.

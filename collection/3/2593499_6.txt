Most blacks are demoncrats, not the other way around.  Historically, the demoncratic party has been the most socially useful to black americans, except for that Republican dude, Lincoln, but he's long gone, and memories are short.  Now, the Republicons, and the demoncrats, neither party had any interest whatsoever in representing any common citizen, black, white, brown or yellow.  Black people are also, slowly, becoming more conservative, a trend I applaud.  The two party system is so very rotten!

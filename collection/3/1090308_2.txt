There is no such thing as ventricular DEfibrillation.  What you are talking about is called ventricular fibrillation (also called V-Fib or VF), and it is an arryhthmia in which the ventricles are pumping out of rhythm with the rest of the chambers of the heart.  This will eventually lead to cardiac arrest and death.  However, it can be reversed if acted upon quickly.  A defibrillator can "shock" the heart back into a normal rhythm.

I have never heard of snakes having blue blood and the ones I have seen, that bled, the blood was red. The only animal I know of that has blue blood is the horseshoe crab. It's  color is from copper that is in it's blood.. . Oxygenated blood (in the veins) is bluish in color and may be mistaken for blue blood, but once it is oxygenated, it turns red (in the arteries).. . The following is a scientific paper on a study of snake blood. Might be a difficult read, but it may give you some information on snake blood.. . STUDIES ON THE BLOOD OF AUSTRALIAN ELAPID SNAKES-H.

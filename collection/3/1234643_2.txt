The term micro air vehicle (MAV) refers to a new breed of remotely controlled aircraft (UAV) that are significantly smaller than similar craft obtainable with the current state of the art. The target dimension for MAVs today is approximately six inches (15 centimeters) and development of insect-size aircraft is reportedly expected in the near future. Potential military use is one of the driving factors.. . Three types of MAVs are under investigation. Airplane-like fixed wing model, bird- or insect- like ornithopter (flapping wing) model, and helicopter-like rotating wing model.. . The range of Reynolds number they fly is similar to that of insect or bird (103 - 105). Thus some researchers think the understanding of bird flight or insect flight is useful in designing the MAV.

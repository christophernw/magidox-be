Wash your face with a bar of soap--NOT THE SAME ONE YOU USE TO WASH YOUR HANDS. Then, dry your face with a towel--NOT THE SAME ONE YOU USE TO DRY YOUR HANDS OR TOWEL OFF AFTER A SHOWER. Then, get a bottle of Witch Hazel (really cheap) at a drugstore and apply it with a folded up tissue or a cotton ball to your entire face. It will dry pretty fast and get off any excess oil, etc. Then, use Clearasil or the generic brand. It really does work. You just HAVE to use it EVERY DAY on the zits. Put it on after you have already changed into your jammies or whatever, so you don't pull off your shirt to change and smear the Clearasil off onto your shirt. Let it dry for a while. Before you get into your bed, especially if you lie on your side when you sleep. It will tingle and you will really feel like itching the parts where you applied it because it burns a little because it is really drying out your skin (that's the whole purpose, plus whatever ingredients are in there). When you put it on, apply liberally--I think that means a lot. Don't just spread it evenly. Put like a tear drop on each pimple and push down a little so it doesn't break off or whatever.

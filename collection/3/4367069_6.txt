The stomach is a muscular organ, which has many digestive roles.  . It is always churning and moving, contracting and digesting.  When it is full of food, it is happily doing its job.  But when it is low or empty, it is . still contracting.  You feel it and hear it because the walls of the stomach . are rubbing past each other, rather than the food that should be there.. . Another reason to hear that noise is because when a stomach is . not full of food it is more apt to get more air into it.  So as it does its . work if there is air in the stomach it get pushed in bubbles back and forth and you hear the bubbles gurgling back and forth.

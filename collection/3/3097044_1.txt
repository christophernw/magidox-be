i wish that i could play "violet baudelaire" in Lemony snicket a series of unfortunate events or "elizabeth swann" in pirates of the carribean they are two of my favourite movies and both of them would relate to me in so many different ways i think. i have even been told the same thing so yeah. ttyl :)

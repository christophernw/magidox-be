The umbilicus (commonly called a navel, or belly button) is a scar on the abdomen, caused when the umbilical cord is removed from a newborn baby. The scar can appear as a depression (sometimes colloquially referred to as an "innie") or as a protrusion ("outie").. . Although they can easily be separated into 'innie' and 'outie' categories, navels vary quite drastically in terms of size, shape, depth and overall look, between people.. . The umbilicus is an important landmark on the abdomen, since its position is relatively consistent among humans. The skin around the waist at the level of the umbilicus is supported by the tenth thoracic spinal nerve (T10 dermatome).. . As well as the visible depression on a person's stomach, the underlying abdominal muscle layers also present a concavity; thinness at this point contributes to a relative structural weakness, making it susceptible to hernia.. . The umbilicus is also used to visually separate the abdomen into quadrants. The navel comes in the center of the circle enclosing the spread-eagle figure in Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man, his famous drawing on human proportions. This illustrates the principle that in the shift between the spread-eagle pose and the straight pose, the apparent center of the figure seems to move, but in reality, the navel of the figure, which is the true center of gravity, remains motionless.

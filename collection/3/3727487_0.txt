I known you said you've seen 40 doctors and have tried everything they prescribe so I hesitate to ask, but have any of them prescribed Topamax yet?  It is an anti-convulsant that you take every day to prevent a migraine from happening in the first place.  I have sever migraines, too, and while it hasn't stopped them completely, it has made a huge difference in my life.  Good luck.

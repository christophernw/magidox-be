Well what i guess is that when you remove batteries, the redox reaction gets imbalanced in some manner and the two ends get charged up. SO once you put in the batteries they again begin discharging and in a few minutes they discharge completely.  Longer you keep it out longer are the poles charged!! so longer is the discharge time!!

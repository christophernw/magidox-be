the drift eliminator in some particular areas of application called as demister as it separates the mist from the liquid. it is made of polyurathene and in the shape of 'S' so when the air enters at the bottom of the 'S' it has to take two sharp curves before passing out and there the solid particles gets adsorbed on to the surface of the demister allowing the free air to go out side.

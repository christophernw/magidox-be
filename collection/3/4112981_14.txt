When you have cancer small things mean a lot, to know that people are thinking of you is terribly important, cOoking for them, and helping with the children, making sure that all the time you have together is quality, enjoying doing things that you haven't done before and taking pleasure in things together is most important.  It is also important to respect that your boyfriend will want some time to be alone to come to terms with everything, and time to spend alone with his children.  Suggest he makes a box for each child and fills it with mementos of their lives together and leaves a letter for each child to open on their special days, such as moving to "big school", going to uni, starting work, getting married etc.  Just being there is the most precious gift you can give him - tell him. DON'T QUIT. DON'T LET THIS THING BEAT YOU. FIGHT IT ALL THE WAY. HAVE DETERMINATION. TAKE IT DAY BY DAY. ITS HARD BUT ITS IMPORTANT. FOR YOU TO SOLDIER ON. LOTS OF PEOPLE CARE FOR YOU. I KNOW BECAUSE I'M ONE. AND BELIEVE ME THERE ARE MANY MORE. SO DON'T GIVE UP THE BATTLE. BELIEVE ME YOU'LL COME THROUGH. and. LET HIM TALK - don't sympathise too much finding the right level of care is difficult - and be aware that not only are chemo and radiotherapy hard - so are the moods and stages you go through, I know I have been there. Good luck and God Bless you all

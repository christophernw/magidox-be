It could be those pills to help muscles grow, I cant remember what their calld. Enzimes or some junk. They dont make you grow, but he could have had an odd spirt of groth due to hormone activity while always working out and combined with those special pills.  . . dont get me wrong, those pills are like vitamins, they are not drugs, but one should be cautious taking them.

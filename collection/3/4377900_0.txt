Be honest, tell him that some of the others invited are uncomfortable with what just transpired on public TV.  Tell him you think he may feel quite uncomfortable dining with people who are not "thankful" that he is among them.  Then just tell him that you hope all goes well for him and that he'll be exhonerated of the charges and that you wish things were different.  I assume the last part is truem but you know what people say about assuming.

What is a gay sound? I kinda know what U mean. Like if I don't see U at all but hear you, I can kinda judge. But then that's all it is: people judge. If you ask me what a "gay" voice is I'd probably say they emphasize the "s" sound, they say "yah" instead of "yeah", etc.. I guess just slowly listen to yourself and compare yourself to some voice you think is ideal. And just slowly change. Who cares if they judge you?

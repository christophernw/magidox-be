I hope you remember your serial number and ss number.. . If you didn't keep all the stuff they handed you in the white envelope (used to be anyhow), do as above, start with your Vet.'s service officer (sometimes they are pretty worthless).. . Be aware that a lot of records have been lost one way or another. Mine were destroyed in a fire with a lot of others, good thing I still had my copies.

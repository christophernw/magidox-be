There isn't always a difference. A monk very often is a priest, just one who happens to belong to a monastic community or order.. . Brother is simply what monastic community members call one another, even if they are priests. And a priest is someone who has had hands laid on them by a bishop and consecrated a priest in the sacrament of Holy Orders. Some priests are diocesan priests, serving a bishop in a territory. Others are monastic and members of orders. . . Such priests are both brother and father. ;-)

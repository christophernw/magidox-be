Historically, when they used lighter covers, you could tell in church who had spent the most time with their Bible because it would be brown from handling.  This made the superficial Christians self conscious because everyone could tell they hadn't been studying, so people started buying their Bibles with black covers.  Publishers make what people buy, black covers sold better.

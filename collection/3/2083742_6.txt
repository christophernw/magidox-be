Some people cannot,"Just get rid of a gloomy feeling".As a person gets older,sometimes their hormone levels change and other body chemistry.Making a person have gloomy feelings more often.Some people can't shake it.They need the help of their doctor.If you just have a few here and there,then find something to do.First of all go outside,just a few rays of sunshine.Sunshine always help to perk you up.Go out somewhere,maybe to  the library or to a bookstore and buy yourself a coffee or whatever beverage you like. Say to Yourself how special a person you really are.Being around other people(even it you don't know them)helps.Go to a music store,listen to some new or old music.Let your mind drift away to a happier time.Take a long bath and maybe read some in a book you have that you never had time to read.Go to your favorite hardware or craft store and look at some ideas of a craft you could learn to do. Or go on the internet.Do some surfing and read about other peoples problems,their problems are most likely worse or you can find people in the same boat you are.Go to websites and answer questions or share the knowledge you have learned in your life. This world begins with you,help to make it better.There are so many things you can do to shake that gloomy feeling and I can't think of a better way than to help others. END

WATER IS NOT MOVED BY ACTIVE TRANSPORT!!! Water is moved by Osmosis (diffusion of water molecules through a selectively permeable membrance DOWN a concentration gradient). Active Tansport requires Adenosine Tri-Phosphate or simply ATP molecules. Energy is used to move particles FROM area where they are in LOW concentration to area where they are HIGH in concentration. AGAINST a concentration gradient. USUALLY through a Transport Protien! active transport is AGAINST the Concentration gradient!

Probaby some sort of infection.  I was the odd one to go to the doctor and find that I had cancer THyroid, and also had swollen lymph nodes.  Get it checked, just to be on the safe side.  I am only 34, and at the time I found out I was about 29 and my mother in law begged me to go because she noticed a lump in my neck. If it were not for her getting on me, I would not be here today.

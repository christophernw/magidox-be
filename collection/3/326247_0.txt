An individual I know personally volunteered to travel to Africa to fight for a certain country's rights over local mob gangs, and he contacted the embassy of the said country, and they directed him to another channel for information and I know he was gone for 2 years, in Africa.  He came back but left again less than 30 days for another area of conflict in the world.  I'd suggest you contact the said country of your choice's embassy like he did in 1999.

In psychodynamic theory, dogs bark more at night because of their ever-active rods in their retina or eyes. When the light dims, the rods begin to take action yet start conflicting with the activity of the cones in the retina because of the hyperactivity of the dog at such a late hour. As a result, surges in the brain cause hallucinations in front of the dog that appear to look like ambiguous shadows. Most people release certain hormones into their blood during these late hours so they usually do not come into the same situation. If they do, they call them demons. But the demons are afraid of the dark so we can debunk that theory right away. . . From an intellectual perspective, dogs bark at night because they the absence of the sun gives them increased boosters in intelligence. Once this source of knowledge and brightness diminishes, the intelligence is gone. Therefore, dogs become mentally unstable at night. Sometimes, they try to be like wolves -- they try to be posers of their ancestors but they fail miserably. . . Some dogs consume a very amiable, narcotic drink at night by urinating in their water bowels and then drinking the solution. This solution is called 5% Molar Estupiocarbohydroxalate dracostolleolum . . . or more simply "Stupid Juice." . . nah they seem to bark more only cuz we are more alert at night of our surroundings. they don't really bark more, we're just stupid enough to believe they do.

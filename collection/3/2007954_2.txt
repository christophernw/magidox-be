Ask the manufacturer or an electrician.  Using power at that level is beyond lethal.. . My job tried to get 3 phase from the electric company, and they were denied because they didn't think they could get enough usage to be profitable for them.. . 3 phase is extrememly powerful...call an expert.  What do you have that is 240 volts and 3 phase to operate?  If you connect it to a 2 phase air conditioner, it would probably blow it.

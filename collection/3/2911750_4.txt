Our bodies produce a layer of mucus in our sinuses.  This layer catches and traps dirt and dust.  This combination of mucus and detritus dries to form, well, buggers, which are then blown out of the nose or removed through other methods humans well know.. . The point of the process is to keep dirt from getting into and collecting in our lungs.

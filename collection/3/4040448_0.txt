the majority of ppl in the U.S. stay ignorant because bush wants it that way, he knows that if most of what really happened on and around the war ever got out he would be dumped big time! so he probably covers a heck of alot up... Americans should get their news from uk or europe and not listen to their own guys prattling on about alot of b******. coz its probably all lies anyway!

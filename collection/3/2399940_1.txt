1 human year equals 7 dogs years, supposedly, b/c dogs don't have the lifespan that a human does.  so if your dog is 5, it's like saying that he's 35 in "dog years.". . however, this site says that that isn't accurate and gives a conversion calculator for you to figure out your dog's age in "dog years."  http://www.onlineconversion.com/dogyears.htm

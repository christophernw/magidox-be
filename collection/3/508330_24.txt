Try a set of Metrinch tools. They work on nuts and bolts that are very difficult to remove. . . I've had great success with these tools on both stripped, damaged and rusted nuts and bolts. . . http://www.mitools.com/. http://www.metrinch-tools.com/. . Sear's Craftsman sells a similar tool called the bolt-out. I've never tried these, but they are based on a similar principle.. http://www.sears.com/sr/javasr/product.do?BV_SessionID=@@@@0243475613.1144682662@@@@&BV_EngineID=ccfladdhhjfekdmcegecegjdghldgfk.0&vertical=SEARS&sid=I0033900150001800085&pid=00952162000

Thailand is actually somewhat close to India.  As you go towards Burma (Myanmar) and then to Thailand, they have more of an Asian or Islander look to them, but still look more Indian than, say, the Vietnamese who are further East.  There is also a history of Chinese immigration and many nomadic peoples in the northern country, so depending on where you go in Thailand you get a pretty big mix.  The only people that I met that looked close to 100% Indian were the guys selling suits, and they usually were immigrants from India or Bangladesh (btwn India and Burma).

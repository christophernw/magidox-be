What are the specs for your system? Do you know how much RAM you have now? If you don't even meet the minimum specs then it won't run, but I find you need much more than the minimum since the Sims 2 is very graphic intensive and a memory hog. I have 1gig of ram and ATI Radeon 9600 video card. Sim 2 works great for me.

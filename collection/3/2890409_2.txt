Start substituting with hard peppermint candies.  No more than six at a time...x2 daily.  It will help the sugar withdrawal, and start weaning you off the cocoa.  After 1 month cut down to 4 candies twice a day, then after another 2 weeks cut down to 3 candies twice a day.  From there, you are fine.  That' only 120 calories extra per day and a little extra sugar for zip.  The peppermints will curb your appetite too...it really works!  You can also chew sugarless mint gum to help curb the cravings.  Again, the mint will serve to curb your appetite.

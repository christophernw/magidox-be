I am a Hindu. I know that Hinduism teaches tolerance, sacrifice, living with other religions. Their is as such no difference b/w a Hindu and christian except the perceptions and the way a person is developed/ broght up in his society. Ultimately we are ourselves GOD and if we really pray we can find GOD whether Jesus or Ram inside our hearts only.

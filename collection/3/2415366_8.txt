religion does not automatically pertain to God, the bible, or any other things that we Christians/Catholics believe. As the same goes for other religions. Religion is a word used to term a belief, "a way of life". It's like rules, but the difference is, you do not feel coercion to follow these rules, rather, you yourself want to live by what the religion tells you to do. That's why Catholicism is different from Buddhism, and they are different from Hinduism... because they tell you different ways to live your life.

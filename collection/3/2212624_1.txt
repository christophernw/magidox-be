really to tell you the truth there is nothing that you can really do for it my mom is the same way she has finally realized that it isn't the way to go and is now trying to get most of her medications and get back on her feet get in school etc. but what you have to realize is that this isn't really your fault but I really don't know much about you or her so i can say much about it with what i have to go by but i can say that you might have to have her talk to a councilor or someone like so that could possible help you both get through all of this

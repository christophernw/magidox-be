First, register to vote. then start a political party. The trouble with existing parties is that they won't commit themselves to any stand until after they're in office. If you get a clear platform, people will vote for you. Start a paper so people won't take your ideas out of context. Don't just say the government is bad, tell what you'd like to change, and state what you will do about it.

No.  Every dog has its own health makeup.  I am not aware of any health problem that every dog belonging to a certain breed has.  Neither of my Chihuahuas have any health problems at this time.  My 4 lb. chihuahua has two extra eye teeth but that doesn't mean that all chihuahuas will have this.  You need to take your puppy to a vet to determined why it is having seizures and do not delay as seizures may be fatal if not treated properly.

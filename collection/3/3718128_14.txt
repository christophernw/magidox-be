The power to heal. Like that movie in the 60's or 70's when that lady would lay her hands on people and cure them. Anybody remember that movie? At the end she work at a gas station in the desert and a couple showed up with there daughter who i think had cancer or something and she got out of the RV and the healer hugged the little girl and you knew she was cured.. I think the  lady in the movie was the older woman in Requiem of a Dream. Relieving someone of there pain would be an awesome power, you could help so many people.

You must be talking social conservatives. I don't know how they could decide what moral is. Seams like a moving target to them. One by why the ones who yell the loudest are exposed as hypocrites. See Tom Delay, William Bennett, Ralph Reed off the top of my head. I think it must be over compensation or something. You know the Jimmy Swagart - Jim Baker syndrome.

Take the item you are molding bury it half way in a pile of clay that has been flattened so that it it smooth except for half your item sticking up out of it. When positioning this make sure you don't have any undercuts-places the plaster would get stuck and not slide off. Make dents or small mounds (at least two) in the clay near the edge. This will help register your piece so that when you have the two halves of the mold they will always line up. You also need to make a channel for pouring in what you are molding. This can always be carved out of the plaster when you are done, but easier to do it when makeing the mold. . . Form a barrier around the clay, either more clay mounded to form a wall or pieces of plastic or metal, anything that will keep the plaster from running. . . Rub Vaseline or similar greasy substance over item to prevent the plaster from sticking to it. . . Pour plaster. Wait for it to set up. Remove from clay, but try to keep the item in the plaster for the time being. Extra clay can be washed off. . . Rub Vaseline over item and all plaster around it. Put your barrier back around it and pour plaster again. After it sets up separate your two pieces and remove original item. . . This is a tricky process and doesn't always work. A lot can go wrong so work carefully and don't use anything you cant stand to lose in the process. . . The process is different if you are making a mold out of silicone or vulcanized rubber. Plaster is most common but it all depends on what you are casting.

If no one is close behind me to where they wont be affected by my nonusage of a turn signal i do not use one. If someone needs to be alerted that i am hopping over in front of them or whatever i use it. but it annoys me when people dont even use it and u could crash into them cause u didnt slow down when they were turning.

I am blue - eyed, and affected by glare, more than many other people.  My optometrist says that this is more of a problem in blue eyed people than people with dark irises.. . The colour of the iris depends on the presence of melanocytes, which make melanin.  In some people, these can make a lot of melanin, and the iris is brown.  Others make less, giving hazel or green irises.. . Blue irises have nearly no melanin in them; the colour results from light being refracted by structures in the iris.  These unpigmented irises do let through some light, leading to glare problems.. . BTW, the white part of the eyeball has an opaque dark layer inside, which blocks stray light.

Did you know that there a many natural ways to help with your Hep C? I am currently doing some research for a friend of mine who has just been diagnosed with it - like yesterday! I would get a second opinion and find out what it is EXACTLY that determines that you have HepC. There are thousands  of people who have been tested improperly. So that is what you should do first. Google some information and do your very own research. Jot down questions and ask your first and second opinion doctors. Research on your own to know exactly what is is you may want to know and ask. Someone giving you information may leave something out. (not on purpose)Google will give you tons and tons of information. Good Luck!

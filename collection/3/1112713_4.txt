You're good. If it were an evening event in New york or Montreal, festive attire would mean to "dress up" - not turn up in shredded jeans, please. In California, because of the weather, it means that sandals are appropriate as well as pressed chinos. You don't need to go in a sequined dress or tuxedo but, if you do, that would be cool,too!

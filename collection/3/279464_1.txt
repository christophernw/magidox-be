Washington DC is not a state or city, it is a district much like you would have different voting districts where you are.   In Washingtion, it is a district for the Federal Government to transact business.  I don't think it was ever large enough to become a state, and if it did, how would it look to have one federal state and 50 sister states.. . The only other place to think about like this is the United Nations.  The land it sits on is considered belonging to all the govenments of the world.

definitely know what you mean and the older you get the harder it is and then you get comfortable with yourself and don`t bother as much,my girlfriend in Australia is finding the same thing ,the isolation is like a world wide epidemic.It`s like men are afraid to approach us...seems like role reversal?depending on what type of partner your looking for I`d have to say hang out where they hang out...

Your cat thinks the world of you and wants you to know it!  That is what I love the most about cats...when they like you, they really like you!. . The kneading is a gesture from their kitten days.  They knead their mother to get milk...and many adult cats knead because it is a comfort thing.  The cat loves/trusts you and probably wants you to pet her.. . Awwww...love don't come any better than that when it comes from a cat!

It is not my duty as a Muslims to stop terrorism. I am not the world police. I have no reason to worry about them because probably they have a reason for doing what they are doing. Nobody can start a war without some justification, the evil that wants to take over the world is just in the sick imagination of fiction writers and producers of cartoon series.. It is easy to blame Muslims for terrorism while in actual fact terrorism is the weapon of the poor against the mighty. Remember, David's sling against Goliath? Also remember that it is terrorism that led to the collapse of the Communist Russia, the terrorism of Afghanistan. Nelson Mandela was once a terrorist, today he is the world respected, Nobel prize winning statesman.. It is not the duty of the Muslim to prevent the poor of the world from rising up and defending their life and resources, Muslims may not approve of the actions of the terrorists but the motivation for terrorism is real and the people would be better in addressing those concerns than blaming innocent Muslims for the actions of hopelessly aggrieved people.. The idea of telling Muslims to do something about terrorism is the good-Muslim, bad-Muslim discourse fronted by the likes Rumsfield.

The best thing to type it on is Word Perfect because the length is longer per page. I would use 12, although, if you're typing a lengthy document, I would use 10. You can get more on the page. Use black ink or blue is acceptable. Make sure to whom you are sending the document's address, name, title, etc. are in the top left corner. Date the document in the right corner. Type "Re:" under the address and briefly write a one or two sentence statement telling what your document is regarding.. Use block style for paragraphs, although a five space paragraph indention is acceptable. Be thorough with dates, times, names, and facts, but be as brief as possible. No one wants to feel like Yogi Bear from the old cartoon...they have to get a picnic basket and prepare for a nap after reading things. You judge how long everything should be, based on your mission and purpose for writing. Remember to enclose a cover letter and thank the reader/readers in advance for taking the time to read  your material. Sign your legal document with only your name at the bottom...no Warm Wishes, Best Wishes, Regards, etc. Sign your cover letter with words such as "Regards" and your name. Remember to type the page number at the top of each page in the right corner. The first page, in this case, isn't necessary to designate. This safeguards any mistakes if the reader lays your pages down. If a page gets mislayed, they don't have to figure out where it goes in the sequence...really impatient people, by common sense, usually won't. Good luck with your quest! By the way, make copies of all of your materials for yourself.

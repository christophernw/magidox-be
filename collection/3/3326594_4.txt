if you are asking focussing on books or generally.... well one possible way is start identifying what is distracting you, or dragging you, tell yourself that you will not allow this to bother you, find intresting possibilities in what u r wanting to focuss on, and try hard.... if u succeed even for a short time, means this works,,, repeat again and again, till the work is done... soon you will get back some of the lost confidence.... do let me know if u hv tried and it helped....best of luck then....

because US oil companies are the fundamental cause of terrorism against the US, they fund political parties that want to retain the US foreign policy which is basically to steal oil and other resources from foreign countries under the guise of humanitarian involvement (e.q. IRAQ). cheap cheap oil is then refined by the companies and sold for decent prices, paid for by everybody and thus MASSIVE immoral profit. of course, in order to do this, they have to supress the the foreign countrys people and economy. this really pisses the ppl off and hence, hatred for america!!

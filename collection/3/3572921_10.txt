Earth ROTATES on its axis.. and REVOLVE around the SUN.. both are different. Answers to both a pretty much similar.. . In a car when u move, u are not moving. u are stationary with respect to the car. passengers inside the car aren't moving as well, all are stationary. When u look outside the window u realize everything around u is going backwards, the trees etc. (considering going forward :D). And a person on the road feels that u are moving. this is called frame of reference.. u may be moving or be stationary in different frame of references.. . now taking the case of earth. U are now sitting on earth as u are in a seat of the car. As the car moves forwards, everything moves backwards. here the earth rotates so the sun moves from east to west.. here u are considering the sun to be moving, similar to trees going backwards while driving. But both are stationary. there earth rotates and the car moves.. . Well u cant really feel the earth to be revolving. the length of day and night changes with different position of the earth around its orbit.

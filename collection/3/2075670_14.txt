ERIC G had a lot of the same ideas I had, but he missed one.  It could be the drive shaft, along with any of the other things people have said on here.  But if you try to fix all of this stuff at once, it will cost you a fortune.  So please have someone figure out what exactly is wrong before you start throwing parts at it.  I love my Lincoln (Ford product), so don't talk smack about these lovely cars.

ok if there is a smell coming from the vent it is from mold growing in the vent.. Here is why. Go to the engine compartment and look at the fire wall. That is in the engine compartment just behind the dash. Now look on the left side of the fire wall for a small tube. It comes out of the fire wall and turns down. This is the ac drain for the condensation from the as. This little hose is plugged up and is not allowing the water to vent out of the tube. Get a pencil and shove it up this little tube. . . As the air works it makes water and there is a  small tray that channels the water out this vent. When it stops up it does not allow the water to drain and mold grows in this channel. Over time it smells up the car.. If you clean out this hose so the water will drain it will wash out the mold and the smell.

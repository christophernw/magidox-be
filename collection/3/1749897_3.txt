That's a hard one.Kinda like asking what is your favorite child.I would have to say my Egyptian/polish Arab is my favorite.I rescued her mother and saw her being born so she has a special place in my heart.She's my baby and would do anything for me and likewise. I love my other Arab too as she was first horse.Then there is my paint who is just the sweetest,laid back horse in the world.They are all special for different reasons,but loved equally.

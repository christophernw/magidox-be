It happens when you are on a payroll and your investment declaration given at the starting of the year are less than the actual investment shown by you at the end of the year.. For e.g:-. . You decalred 50k investment. Your company will start deducting IT based on that (monthly). You actually invested 1 lakh. You show the papers.. Your company will return you the remaining amount.(IT shown in negative)

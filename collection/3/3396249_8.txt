Half blood because they say so in the book.  His mother was of muggle birth.  Even though she was brought into witchcraft, she was biologically a muggle.  . . Saying that he isn't BIOLOGICALLY half is like saying someone who is (for an example, using a friend of mine) is full blooded Filipina even though her parents are biologically Filipino (dad) and Chinese (mom) because both parents were raised in the Phillipines.  However, he may feel full-blooded, which is A-OK.

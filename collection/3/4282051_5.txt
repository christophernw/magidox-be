I think so.  You could ask the labor dept.  or your local employment office but I think you do have that right to ask.  It allows you to determine if they have discriminated against you or what if anything you can do to improve your chances of getting the next position if it was something you did or didn't do.  Either way, since you didn't get the job, it doesn't hurt to ask them why you didn't?  Press them for the truth.   If they are 'funny' about it, suspicious, then call your labor dept. and ask what to do.  Sometimes former bosses can sabotage a future employee's interview by the way they answer a question or don't answer it.  Even though they are not allowed to say negative things on references.

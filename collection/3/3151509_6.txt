God is JUST - The penalty of Sin is Death.  Someone has to pay the price.  Because God is JUST, he cannot simply look the other way.  . . God is GRACE - Because the penalty for sin had to be paid, God sent is only Son to pay the penalty for sin on our behalf.. . Because of God's MERCY, He delayed the payment for our sin.. Because of his JUSTICE, He demanded the payment for our sin.. Because of his GRACE, He made the payment for our sin.

Coeliac disease or celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small bowel that occurs in genetically-predisposed individuals. It is caused by an abnormal reaction to gliadin, a gluten protein found in wheat. Upon exposure to gliadin, the body's immune system cross-reacts with the enzyme tissue transglutaminase, causing flattening of the villi lining the small intestine, which interferes with the absorption of nutrients. The only effective treatment is a diet, lifelong in principle, from which gluten is absent.

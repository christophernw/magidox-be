If you know the happy life, would you work for it?. If you say yes,. then, don't search for happy life in current life as current life is a test. So in a test you'r always passing problems, some are solved and others don't. But a good test (which may mean a happy living) is that you do what makes you pass these problems with success. If you do you'll join the happy INFINITE life as a result for your effort and even in life time you'll be saticified (and internal peace) although of struggles you have out there in life.. At the other side, live careless and do whatever you want (you'll still suffer the boring life) and after death you'll join Hell.

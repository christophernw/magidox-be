AS mention by other LDS, we do not drink alcohol because of healthy reasons, and obedience reason also.. . As you look at the world today, does alcohol helps? Wouldn't it be a better place if there is no drug driving? Wouldn't be a better society if there is no teenage girl wandering who they slept with while they were intoxicated.

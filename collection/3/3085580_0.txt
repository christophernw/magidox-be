It's because when air gets hot it expands, and when it gets cold it contracts.  The cold air coming from the air conditioner is denser than the air that's already in the house, so it tends to sink.  If the AC vent were in the floor, the air higher up would never get cold, but with the vent in the ceiling, the cold air falls through the room and cools everything.  In the same manner, hot air rises, so having the vents in the floor makes the hot air float through the room instead of just staying on the ceiling and leaving the floor cold.

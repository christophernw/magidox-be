Go, get a English newspaper, read it loudly at home...hear CNN news, look for the pronunciation of the words..get assistance from English teachers...talk to your friends in English whenever you have time..and you, You must know one thing, that nobody is perfect in this world! As for your foreign accent, I would say, carry on with it. why would you want to get rid of it? remember, its your mother`s accent.

Because our ingenuity in engineering has been consistently demolished by successive british governments and the cheapness of far eastern and cheap eastern european foreign industry and labour. UK businesses are taxed beyond belief along with the working population. The influx of asylum seekers and eastern european nationals have also put a massive pressure on the UK infrastructure so that world leading public services (National Health Service, Welfare State etc) are now reaching a state of complete collapse. ( I am a civil servant and know the state of the public service) We have a limp Prime Minister happy to be Monkey Boy Bush's puppet and take our countries into an illegal war. (funny how worse things have happened in countries without oil reserves where we have not intervened?!) We are also to scared to speak out against beaureaucratic European Legislation that emasculates british industry as, once again, we have a weak prime minister and unfortunately the opposition leader is all talk and no substance. The official name of our our country is 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain and the Islands' We are no longer 'United' or 'Great'. I am proud to be British or more accurately, of what Britain has achieved in the past (except for slaveryetc obviously)but am now embarrassed by our decline into subservience to the Bush, the EU and political correctness. . And the weathers always s**t!!!. But at least I'm not French ; . (or am I????). What is British? We are a mix of Scandinavian (viking), Saxon, Norman, Celt etc. Even Mrs Thatcher has middle eastern ancestry!!! I have German and Irish ancestry. I'm still British (until I move to Spain and change my name to Juan!!!)

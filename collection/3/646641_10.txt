Jesus said, "Many will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophecy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name? And yet, then I will confess to them:  'I never knew you.  Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness.'. . Not everyone believing in Jesus and doing good works in his name is acceptable to him.  There is more to it than that.

Interesting question. First of all, I don't think that out mind themselves interact with nature, since it has not been scientifically proven that the mind has a physical existence. Rather, it is believed that what we think of as our mind, ie. the little voice in our head that tells us to do certain things, is a product of our advanced brains. Other creatures, such as cats or dogs, do not have as complex brains (so as far as we know) and they do not have what we consider to be a mind.. . I am starting to get into the whole mind/body problem and how they relate to eachother, and I don't want to write pages and pages about it so I will just say this: I believe that the brain has produced our minds as the next level of conciousness, ie. we are aware that we are alive and that we are thinking. Most animals do not exist on this high level on conciousness and do not "know" that they are alive as we do. You might even say that our brains communiacte with out body via our mind.. . Our minds themselves do not interact with nature because they are not physical, but our brain/mind instructs our body to interact with nature. Unless of course you consider our brain and our body to be part of nature and in that case I would say our minds do intertact with nature as they are a part of it because they are a product of our brains.. . The consequences of this interaction between our minds/brain/body is our everyday actions. For example, a normal day: our brain alerts us when it is ready to wake up and become active for the day and our body wakes up too. Our brain may decide that we should go for a walk so our body gets up and goes for a walk.. . Hope this helps and sorry if it's a bit confusing!

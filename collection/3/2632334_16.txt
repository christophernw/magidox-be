On the most fundamental level destroying anything is neither good nor bad. But as humans we have a problem dealing with this fundamental level because we do not live in a vacuum. There is Ethics, morality, religion, culture and human feelings to consider when the killing of other humans comes to mind.  From a human point of view, taking a human beingâ€™s life, in the context of civilization, is an aberrant irrational, dehumanized, sick, perverted, immoral and criminal act. Outside of his civilized environment, the human animal does not need justification to kill.

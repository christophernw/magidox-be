Take a few minutes each day to make a list of all the other stuff. Just write it down. Sometimes it's helpful to make a daily list, too. Either way, when something's done, cross it off. . . I've found this helpful. I spend less time scanning my "mental to-do list"  because I don't have to keep refreshing it in my short-term memory.

i dont think its easy to forgivr... or forget and i think deep down people never really do...... . i think people learn how to push it to oneside, hide it under a whole bunch of stuff. it always pops its head up again but u bury it and then other things get buried on top of it and the ones underneath seem less important or dont hurt as much, thats my opinion.! :-)

It amazes me how many people are totally missing the point of Borat. . . Sacha Baron Cohen is not taking the piss out of Kazakstan. What he is doing is taking the piss out of america in a big way. If you see the film and think that it is about kazakstan then you clearly do not understand the whole point of the film and the charater itself. The fact that the americans are lapping it up without realising that it is them the film is about just makes it all the more hilarious for us here in Britain, and anyone else around the world with any intelligence.. . Now go back to watching will and grace or whatever other brain dead comedy you enjoy.

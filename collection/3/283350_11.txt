Freeze and chip off as much as you can first.  Then follow the directions on a bottle of Goo Gone that you can get at most hardware stores.  Read the directions.  The stuff is great.  It's a citrus oil base and removes sticky stuff of all sorts.  I even used it on the dried and crusted 10-year-old mounting cement that you use to affix emblems to cars, and it came out shiny smooth and clean with little effort.  It also washes out of fabric easily.. Good luck

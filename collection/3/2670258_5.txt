The audio signal going in to your amplifier is called a sine wave.  It consists of positive and negative voltages.  These voltages are low levels and the amplifier sees these and then amplifies them.  As long as the levels are smooth and consistent, the amplifier does it's job efficiently.  As you increase the volume on your radio, the voltage levels increase on the input.  If you increase these voltages too high, the amplifier can get to the point to where it can no longer see the full signal to amplify.  The sine wave bounces beyond the limits of the amplifier and it then waits until the signal comes back to a readable state.  In the long run, this can damage the amp and your speakers.  To correct this, you need to adjust the gain levels on your amp down to prevent signal overload.  So, basically in simple terms, "Clipping" is overloading your inputs.

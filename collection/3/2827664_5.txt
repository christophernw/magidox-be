WE liberals embrace terrorism for political gain? And yet ... DUHbya, Darth Cheney and Co. are benefiting more from terrorism than anyone in U.S. history. DUHbya and Co. actually manipulated the situation we were in due to acts of terrorism and turned it into a money-making agenda! Cheney's buddies at Haliburton are making billions off this war...and I'm sure old Darth is depositing his kickback checks as well ... are you freaking kidding me? You hide behind your Kerry/Coward mask...why don't you replace his face with your real one? That would make a far more realistic picture. There are many more conservative cowards out there hiding behind the idiocy of the DUHbya wave. It's a pity that you mind-melded with the groupthink of your party instead of recognizing the corruption within it. But I think that would be too much to ask... We're not the one in full support of an Administration ran by Corruption, Incorporated and its cronies...and yet you call us the kooks?. . **You're asking us why we feel the need to attack and look at your question...your question is an attack...you accuse us of "embracing terrorism for political gain" then call us "kooks"--so when we throw those same tactics at you, you accuse us of attacking? Pot ... kettle ... black ... you get the picture.

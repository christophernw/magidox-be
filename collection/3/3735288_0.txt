dehydration occurs when your body is depleted of fluids.  This can happen as a result of vomitting for a long while or having chronic diarrhea.  It can also happen from a high fever or even over-exposure to the heat.  It is very serious.  The signs are little to no urine.  Dark urine.  Achy muscles.  Tired.  Feeling as though you may die.  It is good to drink water and if you are feeling dry, just add a pinch of salt to the water (not so you can taste it) because your body absorbs water better with a touch of salt.  For instance, if you were in the hospital, they would give you saline, which is salt water.  hope it helps.  drink up.

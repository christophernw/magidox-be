Actually, in maybe Countries and cultures, eating a salad is after a meal.  And, the salad is not as filled as ours, we have many different types of vegetables and fruits, maybe even nuts in ours, but other places its a simple tomato and Basil, or even different types of Lettius with a few berries in it.  I think they have it after the meal to clean your pallet, salad is normally vary cool and has many flavors, but none that will over power a flavor of wine or coffee or even a dessert that you would eat after a salad.

Other than the sleeve or collar that connects the inner and outer tierods, on each side, and the big nut with cotter pin, there is no tightening. They do swivel, but there should be no play. When they arec worn out and have play in them, they need to be replaced. Its a low cost item to replace, rather than having your truck loose control while driving because one broke.

I bet I have seen more platypus than the lot of you put together and i have never heard any noise apart from the gentle splash as they duck (no pun intended) beneath the surface. However, if you were to be stung by a male platypus in the breeding season you would make a LOT of noise. They are the most venomous mammals in the world.

my favorite way to experience God is through a thunderstorm.. seeing that awesome power manifested in lightning and ground shaking thunder is so sweet.. sometimes just quieting my mind and listening to the nature around me and watching the breeze when i'm outside really make me feel at peace.. give it a shot :). . p.s. also quieting your thoughts when you pray to Him.. not letting your other thoughts distract you as you commune with Him.. that really makes a difference in my opinion

Is your boyfriend an ILLEGAL immigrant? If he has a valid temporary visa then he has nothing to worry about. If it has expired he should renew it, if he ever gets stopped by any authority agent he will be discovered. As far as someone in Ireland calling to have him deported with little to no information, i don't seriously think they would give it much consideration.

We are stuck living until we die. We all are unique but yet also dealing with the every day struggles of life!!! Who are we to judge one another? We do however choose who is our friend,lover,idle,favorite things and that kind of stuff. That is what sepperates us from one another and makes us unique!! Don;t ever be ashamed or feel like your not good enough for the world! The world is full of pshycos,sexual predators, and lots and lots of really  bad as well as really cool people.Learn how to seperate the difference in them and never doubt yourself. You deterrmine what kind of person you want to be and be remembered as!!!

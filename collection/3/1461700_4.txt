I had the same problem with my male cat. I'm not sure why he does it, I thought it might be because I had to quarintine him in the bathroom before introducing him to my other cats. While I had him in the bathroom his litterbox was in the bathtub. Recently he starting going in the tub with a clean litter box and he has also gone in the sink. The only thing that I have found to work is keeping the litter clean and just closing the bathroom door. Now he doesn't do it anymore. Sorry I have no other suggestions, let me know if you find out something..

To start with, a lot of people died: M. Guillotine's invention was put to the test and achieved great fame.  Both King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette "benefited" from the former's invention (as well as hundreds of others).  An Italian, Napoleon Bonaparte came to power and led the country for the next several years -- until sent to Elba for his multiple trespasses against France.

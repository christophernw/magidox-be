Well honestly the strongest force in nature is indeed a force, and not a measurement of temperature.  The strongest force in nature that we know of is the Nuclear Strong Force which is responsible for holding together the nucleus of an atom.. . In terms of heat or cold, I would have to say heat, because you can make something as hot as you want, but you can only make it cold to a certain temperature (-273 deg. C)

I have this theory maybe snape didn't really want to kill Dumbledore... But somehow I have a feeling that this is some kind of a plot that Snape and Dumbledore had planned before.. Even when dumbledore brings Harry to his mission also sounds like a plot to me... Something is not right... But on the other hand, maybe it is for the good, maybe dumbledore already had a prediction that only Harry could destroyed Voldemoth... Harry is the one who destined to do so.... Yeah, I know, I sounds crazy but I have observed the book so hard until I came up with this theory... Maybe I was wrong... (weak laugh)

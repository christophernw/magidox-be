First, female Homosexuals are not necessarily sodomites. Also, sodomy is not limited to the homosexual lifestyle so it would not be very accurate. And in American culture sodomy is not well accepted (it is even still illegal in some states - ever wonder who the sodomy police are?) so it would most likely be seen as derogatory and offensive to call them sodomites. . The term Homo comes from the Greek for "same" while sex is our word (from Latin) for "sex" or "gender".  Just like Hetero is the Greek for "different".

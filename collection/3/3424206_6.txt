Don't act too eager for friends -- always act nice, but you need to be in the frame-of-mind that you're doing people a favor by making yourself available as a friend...that takes a lot of self-confidence, but people are naturally attracted to that sort of thing.  I'm not saying to act like a snob, just self-assured.  Other than that, just be yourself.  And if being yourself means exuding low self-esteem, you really need to work on that.  Good luck!

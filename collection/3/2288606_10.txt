Christians believe that the man called Jesus was the Messiah, the Savior that is prophesized in Jewish scripture.. . Jews do not believe that the man called Jesus is the Messiah. Their reasoning is that they say a number of other prophesies that are linked to the Messiah have not been fulfilled (such as a new era of peace happening when the Messiah comes). They feel that Jesus was just another prophet and are waiting still for the Messiah.. . When Christianity started, not all of the Jews believed that the man called Jesus was the Messiah. Those who did believe were the first Christians. Those who didn't, remained Jews.

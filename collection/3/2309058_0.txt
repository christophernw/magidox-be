Place used teabags in the freezer.  When needed pop one on each eye, sit back and chill for a while - the antioxidants in the tea and the coolness is said to sooth puffiness.  Don't leave on too long or do too often, as the tea can stain your skin making your eyebags look worse.  (I have also heard some people say they have had excellent results with haemorrhoid cream - a brand called Preparation H?)

IM SORRY YOUR HAVING PROBLEMS THIS YEAR. BUT IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE KIND OF HELP THAT YOU NEED. YOUR LOCAL FEDERAL INDEPENDANCE AGENCY AND THE SALVATION ARMY AND THE GOODWILL AND TOYS FOR TOTS ARE ALL A GOOD START. YOU CAN ALSO ASK YOUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR HELP.  AND MANY CHURCHES OF ALL KINDS OFFER HELP. . . THERE IS HELP AVAILABLE OF ALL KINDS YOU JUST HAVE TO ASK.  . . AND DONT BE EMBAREASSED ABOUT IT. IT HAPPENS TO THE BEST OF US. LAYOFFS  THE LOSS OF JOBS AND PERHAPS THE LOSS OF A SPOUSE IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER THROWS A WRENCH TO THE BEST LAID PLANS AND INTENTITIONS.  . . JUST REMEMBER TO GIVE BACK WHEN YOUR ABLE. . . THINGS WILL PICK UP. . . HAPPY HOLIDAYS. TO YOU AND YOURS.

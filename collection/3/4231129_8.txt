He can't is right. As for the comment that the morals were different in those days and that culture-apparently they were, but that doesn't make them any less immoral.What will the future generations-if there are any-say about the fanatical suicide bombers and hijackers of airplanes that kill innocent lives in the name of Allah and Mohammad...that it was their culture and morals that made it acceptable to them. What an evil culture it is. Right is right in any age. And murder is not right ever-even back then. Neither is rape, or any sin. As for Mohammad, he is already in hell, and will lead those who follow his pernicious ways there as well.Follow him at your own risk, as well as all the other imposters, charlatans, false messiahs that have risen up from the pit of hell to deceive men and women into following them and their religions. There is but ONE way and His name is Jesus. Believe or be damned. Harsh enough? I don't apologize. Millions will perish because of this false prophet. How can I be silent?Father forgive us for not warning men against this evil and allowing PC dictate our paths.Open our eyes that we might open our mouths and speak the truth, no matter what the cost, political or otherwise. Hate mailers, bring it on. You only add fuel to your awaiting hell fire.

I got my PC from an office site where it was being used for office stuff, and Civ IV wouldn't work at all.  I put a new graphics card in and it worked but it was still slow.  Then I went to the CivIV website and downloaded thier patch and now it works great.  The patch goes and cleans up stuff you don't need like if you talk english you don't need 100 other languages worth of text in there and so forth.

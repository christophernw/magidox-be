Look at the zip.. if it has YKK on it it is a jap import. Gucci genuine products have the logo imprinted into the casting on the zipper.. . Also the stiching on the underside of the inner compartment will have 7 cross stiches representing the 7 generations of the gucci family. Fakes do no include this.

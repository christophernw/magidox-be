It's usually stress related.  When you get too tired it happens too.  I had an eye twitch for almost 6 months after my Mom died, (thank God nobody could see it, it was under my eyeball) the doctor said it was stress.  When I get tired or I'm under pressure it comes back but goes away again.  If it bothers you go see your doctor to make sure otherwise get some rest and chill out.

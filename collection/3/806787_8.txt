You need to become licensed in your state.   In my state this is a week long class.. . Then you'll probably want to work in an established office.   Shop around since different franchises offer different deals.  You may get smaller/larger commissions.    You may need to pay for part or all of your advertising.   . . Expect to work long hours, especially weekends and evenings.   . . You must be a very patient person.  Don't be suprised if some buyers look at houses for weeks and weeks.   . . You must love people.   Be an outgoing people person. Network with others.

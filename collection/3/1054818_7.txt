Unfortunately, there are people out there who just CANNOT or WILL NOT force their little darlings to do ANYTHING the little brat doesn't want to do. It makes the child very UNhappy believe it or not, and makes everyone ELSE around them miserable.. . Children who are allowed to get their way all the time grow up to be very poorly adjusted adults, and MANY of them never grow up at all!

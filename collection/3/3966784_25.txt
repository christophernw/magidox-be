well todays cartoons i would say spongebob, my favorite episode is where they learn a swear word and the dolphin noise covers it up. i also like dee dee from dexters labratory she is so funny. the older cartoons i would have to say papa smurf he had so much wisdom is that little blue body and he had to deal with some other stupid smurfs.

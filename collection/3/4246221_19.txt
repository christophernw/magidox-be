You can drink in the pub, I'm glad they are stopping people smoking,I've give up smoking for a few months now ,I've not wanted to go to a pub because of the smoke, if I smell a cigarette it nearly chokes me, so now I no what I've put other people through when I did smoke.. It the best thing in the end

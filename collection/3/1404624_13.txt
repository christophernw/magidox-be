I don't. I try to talk to people in their own language, so if I'm talking to someone whose speech is slangy, I might talk slangy too, but I don't assume that the person is stupid.. If you stop putting all whites into the same category, maybe more whites will stop putting all blacks into the same category. I know I'M ready.

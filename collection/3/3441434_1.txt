Eyes are one of our most powerful senses. They have direct wiring directly to the brain.  Not only do the eyes pull in images, but eyes reflect the surrounding of the person.  They are a perfect two way communicator that connects us to the world.  When I clicked on this question I started to think about Blind People ... and they too have this mysterious ability to communicate their feelings to us through their eyes.  Amazingly for such a small part of our body, our eyes do give us the most information and they also reveal the most information about us.

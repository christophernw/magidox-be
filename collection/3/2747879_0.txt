Humans are social animals. There are many other animals that can survive by themselves, but humans naturally form groups. Forming a group is beneficial for humans because we have very little natrual defenses against threats; around other humans, there is a better chance of survival. Loneliness is nature's way of saying "being by yourself is detrimental to your chances of surviving."

Global plagiarism is copying a major piece of text word for word and not citing where the text is coming from.  Patchwork plagiarism is taking a major idea from a piece of text, maybe changing some of the words, and still not citing where the idea is coming from.  So, global is copying actual text while patchwork is copying a central idea from the same text.  Patchwork plagiarism is often much less severe than global plagiarism, and patchwork usually involves copying four or more consecutive words.

Polaris, commonly called the North Star, is a star that just happens in the present day to be located very close (within a degree or two, if memory serves) of the north celestial pole, or the apparent point on the celestial sphere that corresponds with the earth's north pole (i.e., the sky appears to us to revolve on the north celestial pole as if it was an axis).. . Because of precession (or the "wobble" of the earth on its axis, much like a top wobbling as it spins), the north celestial pole changes over thousands of years, sometimes happening to point to a star (as it does now, purely by coincidence), sometimes not (there is no "south star" at this time).  Thousands of years ago, the star Thuban, in the constellation Draco the Dragon, was close to the north celestial pole and was therefore considered the "north star" by ancient Egyptians.

Gravitational force is when an object is thrown into an orbital force it has inertia that pushes it forward and gravity to keep it from flying away in the end it results in a ring push a toy car off the table it falls right but when theres a greater force(inertia) it goes out further now pretend theres a string attached and the car would make a ring. so ya thats it.

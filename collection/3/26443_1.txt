I would seriously consider starting a website, if you can. It looks really professional, and you're way more able to get the "high-paying" customers that way, than if you were to sell to people on ebay.. . I mean, I HAVE HEARD that sometimes people can really hit goldmines with ebay, but for a better number of customers (at least) I would suggest getting a website...either creating it yourself (only if you're good!), getting help from somebody else, or paying somebody to do it for you.

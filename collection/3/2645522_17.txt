Excellent question. Not only altar boys but also many other children have been sexually abused - in some cases raped - by Christian ministers, priests and even nuns. . . That being a very good argument that Jesus/Issa/Yuz Asaf was not a god at all, but only an angel prophet.. . Compassion dictates evolution. When you have a "god" that is not compassionate and morally responsible with innocents in his or her own church, what you really have is a FALSE GOD.. . To have Gifts of the Spirit (like healing, charisma, telekinesis, etc.), does not necessarily mean that someone is a god. It just means that they channel a large collective of spirits who grant them those abilities.. . For example, Sai Baba of India, decades ago before his Gifts lessened due to misuse, was thought of by many to be the "Christ of India" due to the fact that he could duplicate all the miracles of Jesus. (The rising from the dead feat having truly happened in the first place is highly questionable - especially since Jesus has never come back since, and because of the evidence uncovered that he not only escaped crucifixion but died in India at the age of 80 - after declaring that he was the Galilean Messiah.) In recent years many have come out on the Internet to accuse Sai Baba of being a sexual predator of young men and boys at his ashram. So one does not have to be highly evolved in order to have Gifts of the Spirit. Even Adolf Hitler had a Gift of Charisma and Prophecy! . . A true litmus test for God Realization is whether or not someone who has recently died can come back from the dead in a fully grown, youthful and beautiful body, and who does so all the time, teleporting around and healing people, among other miracles.. . No one does that now because there are no Ascended Masters in existence...yet. . . A God Realized Aristocracy is still in its formative stages.

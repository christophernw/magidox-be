Well you have to make sure that your DVD player will play burned CD's anyways you may want to check the book that came with your DVD player and see if it says its a DVD+R/ +R or DVD-R/ -R I know sony puts one out because we just recently bought one to play ours on so you have to check and see if thats what you have if not go to the store and look for the DVD like yours or ask someone who may know there at the store. Hope this works for you and Good luck.

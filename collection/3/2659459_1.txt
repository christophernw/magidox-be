Seattle very big on recycling.. Separate garbage from recyclables.. Separate glass.. All in separate containers.. Seattle shooting for 60%.. http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/util/Services/Recycling/index.asp. . Recycling very good and not hard to get accustomed to.. I do yard work for friend....I compost as much of the yard waste as I can.....I got two piles going......one pile I keep under a tarp just to start composting process.. And A composter to complete the process.. . Its all good.. Seattle pretty clean city.

"Low" is a matter of perspective, what are you measuring it against...steel?. . Actually, water boils at a pretty high temperature considering the elements which make it up.  The intermolecular forces experienced by water molecules (Hydrogen bonding and London forces) are actually quite strong and serve to raise the boilin point far above similar compounds.. . Take H2S (Hydrogen Sulfide).  It is chemically very similar to water (H2O), however, its boiling point is around -50 degrees C, and water's is 100 degrees C.  What causes this big difference?  It is the Hydrogen bonding water experiences, whereas the H2S does not eventhough Sulfur is just 1 element below Oxygen on the periodic table.

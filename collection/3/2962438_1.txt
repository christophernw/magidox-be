It is the number that both of them will first divide into equally. You may do it by formulas (different ways). http://sierra.nmsu.edu/morandi/CourseMaterials/LCM.html. .  or by testing (like with excel or by hand), . . or by plugging into an online calculator that does it for you. http://schoolweb.missouri.edu/manes.k12.mo.us/lcmgcd.htm.. . The least common multiple of two integers is the smallest integer that is a multiple of both numbers. For example, lcm(4, 6) = 12 and lcm(10, 15) = 30. As with greatest common divisors, there are many methods for computing least common multiples. One method is to factor both numbers into primes. The lcm is the product of all primes that are common to one or the other (or both) of the numbers. For example, to calculate lcm(45,800), we factor 45 and 800, getting . . 45 = 3 × 3 × 5 . 800= 2*2*2*2*2*5*5. . The primes common to one or the other are 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5. The least common multiple is then 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 7200. . . Another method lists the multiples of both numbers until the first common multiple is found. To use this method efficiently, write down multiples of the first number until the result is larger than the second. Then write down multiples of the second until they are larger than the largest multiple of the first. Continue with this alternating procedure. For example, to find lcm(45, 800), we would write down the multiples . . 45...........800. 45. 90. 135. 180. 225. 270. 315. 360. 405. 450. 495. 540. 585. 630. 675. 720. 765. ............800. 810. 855. 900. 945. 990. You would have to do this until they are the samae number, pretty time consuming by hand, not excel.. . A third method is to use the formula (really the easiest by hand). . lcm(a, b) = a × b / gcd(a, b). . . To use this formula we can compute a greatest common denominator) gcd (a whole new calcualtion), then do the multiplication and division. For example, once we see that gcd(45, 800) = 5, we get lcm(45, 800) = 45 × 800 / 5 = 7200. . . Testing by hand:. 800 (largest number). 45   (divided by the smallest number). 17.77777778 (smallest into largest, not an even number). . 1600 (double the first number and try again). 45. 35.55555556 (nope). . 2400 (keep going). 45. 53.33333333. . 3200. 45. 71.11111111. . 4000. 45. 88.88888889. . 4800. 45. 106.6666667. . 5600. 45. 124.4444444. . 6400. 45. 142.2222222. . 7200 (THIS IS IT!). 45. 160 (divides evenly)

my bacon is prewrapped, as far as the hot dog dilemma what happens is when you have your barbecue and finish your dogs you generally load em up rite off the grill to the bun, then the inevitable happens a dropped dog!!! you can rinse off the dog not the bun ,hence you toss the effected bun and use your reserve bun and voila soups on.Now all this is made possible due to the large quantities of liquor associated with these outdoor events.I hope i have made your road to knowledge a little smoother,lets do it again soon.

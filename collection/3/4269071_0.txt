I would say because it is following the path of least resistance to reach its destination - this path is not usually, if ever, a straight line.. . Think of it this way. If you wanted to reach the water fountain from down the hall but there was a group of people standing in the middle of the hall. Would you burst right through their group just because you wanted to go in a straight line to the water fountain? No. It would take up too much time and energy. It would just be easier to go around the group to reach the water fountain. . . Hope this helped!

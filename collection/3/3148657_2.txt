I don't regret a damn thing. If you hate Thanksgiving so damn much don't freaking celebrate it. Donate your food to people who can't afford it instead of whining about how fat you're going to get.. . I'm going to celebrate with my family, I'm going to have my turkey and potato stuffing and my apple pie and you health freaks can shove your complaints where the sun don't shine.

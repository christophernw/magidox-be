I have read that the feeling of jumping or falling is the body's reaction to falling in to a deeper state of sleep.. . There are different stages of sleep, some of them are very light, like you are actually asleep but don't think you are; while others are a lot deeper. When in the deeper stages of sleep your body is pretty much paralysed, your body does not move in this stage of sleep. It is when you are falling into this stage of sleep that sometimes your body reacts to it and creates a jerk in the muscles which sometimes wakes you up.

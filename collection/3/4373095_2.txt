I think you mean the "not-as-touristy" places (like Empire State Bldg etc).. . Well, you can visit The Lower East Side Tenement Museum - very cool.. You can walk along the promenade in Battery Park and take in great views of the Statue of Liberty and New Jersey.. You can take the subway to the Cloisters.. You can go to a local diner.. You can visit Cooper Union University ... . . email for more suggestions.

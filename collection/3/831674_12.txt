to burn fat you need to do cardio, at least 20-30 minutes.  you need to keep your heart rate higher than normal (of course not too high).  getting your heart rate in that "zone" is where you really start to burn fat.  swimming is actual one of the best cardio exercises you can do because it is low-impact on the joints, offers resistance, and is a total body workout.

I would say dogs because they are more loyal. They provide great companionship. Also if you have the time and ability to train them, they can go with you to places, or do some pretty neat things. I feel as though cats can sometimes be lazy, yet they are active sometimes too. But dogs are more friendly. Plus, they also can guard you and your house! that is my opinion.

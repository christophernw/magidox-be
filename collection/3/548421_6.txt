You can see any of your neighbours also having this problem as you have and altogether go to them and say about this politely, then they will have pressure to stop it some or other way.  If you are only the one, then you just write a note or send a letter to their home. If it they didn't listen to that then take a step to call police on this, being anonymous. However nothing would happen if you on your own go directly and say to them that some one in your house has problem with the noise and are unable to have sleeps in nights, as long as you put that in polite manner. Don't worry even if they come down to quarrel, as it is question of your rest..Go ahead.

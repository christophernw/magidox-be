First of all, it wasn't an apple, read your Bible. But that is neither here nor there.. God told Adam to eat of EVERY tree except one as a test of Adam's devotion to God above himself. Then Adam told Eve what he had heard from God. Satan temped Eve and Scripture says,.  "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat." Genesis 3:6. . So Adam and Eve sinned equally.. They put themselves above God.. That was just the FIRST sin.. We've each added to the list and need forgiveness just as bad as Adam and Eve did.

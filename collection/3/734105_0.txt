You are right; Delaware is the number one home state for corporations.  It has one of the oldest systems of business regulation in the country (being the oldest state.)  The state legislature has always put a lot of effort in maintaining very clear, and often pro-business laws on their books. An easy tax system, no corporate income tax, a sympathetic court system, and a pro-business government bureaucracy make for a great place to set up your HQ.

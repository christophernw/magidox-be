Sounds like your bloating when you eat.  You could be allergic/sensitive to something your eating like wheat or dairy.  Its also possible your body is lacking in digestive enzymes...Natural Factors make a full spectrum digestive enzyme supplement that works pretty good.  It would help reduce the bloating.  Maybe watch how much your eating and of what.  If I eat pasta, bread, red meat, cheese or gorge myself I look pregnant until the next day.  When I was 24 I would eat 1/2 a grapefruit after every meal I ate and that seemed to reduce the bloating as well.  Some more other things are mild dysfunction of thyroid and adrenal glands.  Low energy and bloating after eating are some of the symptoms.  To learn more about that just search "low energy and bloating"  and choose the result written by Dr. Rind.  Mild dysfunction can be easily treated with natural supplements and diet changes that you will find on that website.

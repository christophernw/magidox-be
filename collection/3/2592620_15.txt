A true born Again Christian Never hates anyone.Except for the grace of God there go I.  The reason most people participate in the Q&A is to minister to the lost. I'm not above,better than anyone. Only saved by the grace of God. There are alot of people that say they're christians but act and talk like the devil himself. Jesus said you will know a tree by It's fruit.  Jesus ate with the prostitutes and the sick,the undesirable crowd. He loved them all and Died for US all,Not the good crowd. Good people still go to hell. The question Is ...Have you accepted the free gift of pardon? Please read the Bible for yourself. It's not about denomination or even religion. It's about a personal relationship with JESUS CHRIST.

welll since your young, dont get to caught up in weight loss (you dont want to go overboard and become to skinny) . its really great to be muscualar...dieting alone will make you loose the muscle which is a bad thing. you want to eat healy and work out.. the best thing to do is to not eat any sugar or white bread. eat wheat bread and a lot of fruits and veggies. drink a lot of water and im talkin more than 8 cups per day. . try for 10 days to not eat any sugar and after a while you wont even want it any more!. trust me, this kind of routine worked for me! work out, eat healthy, eliminate soda and fast foods, take vitamins, and drink water!

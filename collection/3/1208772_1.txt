Well fuzzy wozzy I did not care for any of the answers so please allow me to give my two cents worth.  Australia had the same issues as did America the anti war protesters were giving their Government Hell and they could see like Iraqi that Viet Nam was was not winable. They began withdrawing men the same time we did and remained in country to the very end.. . I do not see exact figure but statements that read some 520 were KIA with 2488 wounded (however the next source has different figures).. . I can vouch for one thing the gooks hated and would not mess with the South Vietnamese Marines or Rangers; ROKs Republic of Korea or the Ausses.  I saw thw ausses chase some NVA (North Vietnamese Army) and Viet Cong through half of Viet Nam and into Cambodian before catching them.  . . God Bless You and the Southern People.

Christmas isn't about Jesus anymore.  It is about the single largest retail sales month of the year.  Even most Christians spend way more time dealing with presents, shopping, traveling, worrying, than they do in prayer or in church.  And on average spend 20 times more money on gifts and decorations than the give to the church during the month of December and almost 11/2 times the amount they give the church in a given year.. . You go ahead and celebrate Christmas,  You don't have to believe in God to believe in Santa.

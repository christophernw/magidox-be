My Mother taught me, If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all. Obviously, Truth and Dignity do not exist in their public utterances, so how can any self-respecting citizen of good conscience abbrogate any of our authority unto those who merely profess to coincidentally share some opinions, and fail to serve the representational 'democracy' so blatantly betrayed? We are seeing immature, greedy, self-serving sociopaths seeking office and power, not citizen statesmen seeking to save all those lives doomed to the terrorism of imposed police state. Nay, they want to be part of the ruling class, not part of classic rule of self-government. These are the lazy schoolyard cheats now seeking to become the bullies. They will steal your lunch if you let them. The negativity is a reflection of our inapproriate tolerance- our permissiveness and lack of focus on matters grave and treasonous, and our failing to condemn them with our power- our right to call it treason! No incumbent left behind!

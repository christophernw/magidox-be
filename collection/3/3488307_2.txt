The inability of a lens to bring to focus different colours to a point is chromatic abberation,focus and hence focal length of a colour depend on the refractive index of the material of lens,the RI of the medium and the wavelength of the colour,Chromatic aberration is found mainly in lens. . The inability of a mirror or a lens to bring to focus axial and marginal rays to a point is spherical aberration

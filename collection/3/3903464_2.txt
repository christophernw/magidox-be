okay... you are attracted to guys... no big deal ... its the same thing as being attracted to girls only with guys... you are gay its not like its your fault you shouldn't feel guilty or ashamed...if thats the way your body works and your mind thinks then who cares if you like men... if they turn you on then go with that...don't marry a woman just because you don't want to be gay because you don't just turn straight after marriage... BE PROUD

Sally, flight fright, it's pretty simple, just remember that you are going to die one day, if it happens today, it happens. The main thing is people believe if they are in an airplane, you have no way of getting yourself out of the situation. The fact is if you are in a car, you probably have just as much chance, as people in planes also survive accidents. You have more chance of dying in a car than on an airplane, you should get yourself not to think about it, put your mind on other stuff, book planes that you know are going to have entertainment on them such as movies. You may also want to try mentally preparing before you get on the plane, but the best is to do your best not to think about it, remember it may take a couple times of flying before totally get your mind of what u are doing.

I hope with the made up life your teacher also gave you a made up W-2 form!  You would need that to complete a tax return.  TactAct Online is a step by step tax form help site,but I think you have to pay .The IRS also has loads of help out there for free!. The 1040 EZ form is just that EZ- but I think for the project you will need to fill out the regular form.  It also comes with instructions. Since it is after April 15, try the IRS website to get their forms and instructions.. Good Luck!

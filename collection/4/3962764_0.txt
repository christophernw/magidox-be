Well, my very unprofessional opinion would be to coat your entire body with catnip and roll around on the floor right in front of her.  ...Of course, if that doesn't work, try rubbing her stomach if she'll let you, and while you're rubbing, tickle her nose with a feather or something.  It should catch her off guard, and she might start to bat at it a bit.  If she goes for that, then maybe she'll play again.

IT's were never a sound business plan. I got out of them when the Liberals dropped the sack just as they were being replaced by present Gov't.. . I feel for people who relied on the so-called 'experts' that tended over their mutual fund holdings. They should be held accountable.. . Others who saw them as a get rich quick idea should learn not to be so naive. Investing blindly separates fools from their money.. . A subscription to Investment Reporter (Canada) or John Dessauer's Investors World (US) will help average people gain extra-ordinary results.. . Good Luck to all involved.

If you are asking why you only received a $50 refund, and want more back at the end of the year, then you have to have more withheld from your paycheck.  Ask your employer for a new w-4 form and change your status to Single and 0 dependants.  You can also ask them to withhold an additional dollar amount each check.  For instance if you are paid bi-monthly and have an extra $50 withheld on top of your regular withholding tax, then at the end of the year you would have paid in $1200 that you should get back in a refund.

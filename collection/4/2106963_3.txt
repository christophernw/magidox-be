Because the refining process is much more expensive.  Also...California is considered to be the most different from the rest of the nation, our ideas are far out, so we must pay the federal goverenment more money to stay in the Union.  The weather also cause Californians to drive more and therefore we consume more gas than other states.  When it's sunny, people just wanna drive their convertibles more.

brain tumors, like any tumors, are caused by uncontrolled cell division and reproduction.  this is most usually caused by the combination of extreme toxins, carcinogens, and the breakdown of the body's immune system.  certain substances have also been linked to development of brain tumors, like MSG.  ingesting substances like that on a regular basis, coupled with a weakened immune system will probably lead to a brain tumor.

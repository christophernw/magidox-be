I am an averaged size woman, but I have that belly fluff. . I got a pilates dvd and did it 30 minutes a day for two weeks and got pretty tone in the mid section. I was amazed. ITs really really easy to do and most of it is laying down! . I would recomend this to any person of any shape. Easy to do and with quick results.

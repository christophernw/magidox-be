People were being bad.  They were not following the commandments, and life was really horrible.  G-d found one good person, Noah, and told him to build an ark, get two of every animal species (one male, one female), and to put them on the ark, along with him and his family.  Then G-d flooded the Earth, basically killing all forms of life on the Earth.  Then, G-d ended the flood, and made a rainbow as His promise to never do it again.. It's a really good story.

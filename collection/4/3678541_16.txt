Street signs should be larger, and they should be before an intersection, so you know what street you are approaching.  Nothing like having to make a left turn and being in the right lane half way through the intersection because you could not read or see the sign until then.. . Also, signs should be on all streets.  N,S,E,W indicators should be on primary and secondary roads.. . Reflective is good too.  Should not be blocked by signs, shrubs, trees, etc.. . Also, when streets appear to go straight, but you have to make a turn to stay on the same street, or a street goes straight but changes names, there ought to be some alert indicator, to indicate name change or direction change.

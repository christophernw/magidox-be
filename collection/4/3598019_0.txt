Easier than you might think if you are scanning images to start with. . . There are many tutorials out there for filling in color, losing color, making an image "cartoony" and the like. . . Photoshop also offers a nice range of "talk balloons" for your characters to speak. Just build a pane or window to put your image in to be consistent and go for it.

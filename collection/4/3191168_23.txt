It doesn't just scare me, it's my biggest fear.  I'm not a religious person, so I don't imagine that there is a heaven with my already departed friends and family waiting. Actually, I envy those that do believe in afterlife or heaven, because it would be truly comforting to believe that this is something after death.  I've pondered this issue and always find myself torn - I want to believe, but it's almost like asking me to believe in Santa Claus.  It's horrifying to think that when I die, I'm gone forever.  No second chances - this is it.  It changes the way I go about life, too.  I feel a constant sense of urgency...I need to to this or that before I die.  The death of others' close to me is equally as difficult, but perhaps since I know that they believe, I'm somehow comforted...which I suppose is a sign that even I have questions about what might happen after death.  The one thing I know for sure is this:  NOT believing in heaven and Christ is HELL on Earth.  I don't need anyone to tell me this, as I've figured it out on my own.  I pay for my doubts by living in fear of death every day.

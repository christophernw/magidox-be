Some of the most beautiful people ruin it with their selfish personalities.  I don't care how gorgeous your hair is or how perfect your makeup or how beautiful your body looks in your fashionable clothes....if you are a nasty, selfish, one-way btch, then you are NOT BEAUTIFUL.  Loving compassion comes in many shapes, sizes and styles and is always beautiful.

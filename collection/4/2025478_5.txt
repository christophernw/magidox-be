Nothing can remove the pain of losing a child or having that loss be eminent. You can however remember to pray for your friend and be there to assure him/her that God is in control. The bible has a beginning, a middle, and an end...the story is already written, the battles are already won.God has a plan for that family that we may never know. The best thing I have ever been told when I lost someone is..."We may never know why, but we can be assured that God does know, and knows the pain we are feeling and is right there holding out his arms to comfort us whenever we need Him."

fearing God is like another form of saying respecting God the word does not mean to be afraid of him it means to be respectful, and loving him first over everything else so when you hear the word God fearing it doesn't mean to be afraid but to love and respect him its sort of like the words were they sound the same but have different meanings so yeah i hope that helps

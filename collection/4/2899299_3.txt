As a christian, our views are probably different that the views that other people have.  "Midnight Cowboy" was considered porn it its day. Now if the same movie came out today, it would probably get a PG13 rating at the most.  It's pretty scary to think about what our children and grandchildren will be exposed to.  I would say that in God's eyes, porn would be anything immoral, and that includes programs that might be on television tonight.

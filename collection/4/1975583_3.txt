You are right when you aver that the Bible stresses on circumcision. But take a look at reality. Are you Christians circumcised?!?!?! . . I fail to comprehend why you Christians don't stress on this tenet of your faith. . . Now, coming to your question, circumcision is significant because firstly, it is God's will; and secondly, because it is hygienic. A recent report of WHO stated that circumcised males are less prone to the HIV virus.

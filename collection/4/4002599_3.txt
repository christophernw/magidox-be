To get the truth, check the US budget for the last 50 years, and find out how many BILLIONS have been given to the "poor"by our taxpayers. Remember how small a percentage of the population they really are, and calculate how many dollars PER PERSON they have been given. In welfare, foodstamps, tax exemptions, earned income credit, adc, etc. Add student loans. . . If they don't want to be poor, let them get off their asses and produce something!

Did you know that the greatest amount of pollution is done by nature?bOne volcano around 70,000 years ago spewed out more carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide in one day than man has produced in all of history. It almost killed off our species. But, the Earth has immense regenerative properties. So, I think you can let up on the smokers a little bit. They are not doing that much damage.

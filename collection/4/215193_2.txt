I think it's the one that makes it a crime to insult the Turkish state or its institutions, totally contrary to the EU human rights law.. There is one prominent journalist/writer being in front of the courts just now, and that has led to friction.. The other reason is of course the racism of many Europeans, or more "anti-moslemism", the Turks are no different colour from other mediterranen people at all, and in continental Europe that kind of racism really and truly is not very common.. And there is the age-old enmity between Turkey and Greece, still virulent over Cyprus, where I think the Turkish Cypriots have already been treated very shabbily by Europe.

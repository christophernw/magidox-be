Reduce carbonated beverages like pop because it adds sodium. . . Drink more water.. . Add 250 steps to your day every day for one week and you'll burn at least one pound (considering that you're caloric intake is where it should be for your weight). . . Limit breads & dairy products to two servings per day for adults (that's one half slice bread and one fat free yogurt). . . Abstain from all alcoholic beverages. . . Limit your snacks to one per day and eat no more than the three meals.. . Whatever you do, do not starve yourself or skip meals because this will slow your metabolism way down and cause you to stop losing. Do not aim to diet, but aim to eat better because you'll likely be more successful. And...get plenty of sleep. When you're not well rested, your body will crave more and urge you to make poor food choices. Good luck!

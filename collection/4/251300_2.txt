Wean yourself off slowly.. Get rid of your favorites folders so you have to put a lot of effort into getting back to them when you want them.. Unplug your computer.. Get rid of the Internet in your home.  You can go to a public location for it so you will have to reduce your usage and you will have 1 less bill.. Seek professional help...like a support group or something.. Good Luck.

Distilation, in its most basic form, is simple just evaporation and condensation. It is evaporating a hot liquid and then condensing it on a cold surface. So when you boil "Mac and Cheese" noodles, with the lid on, you are esentially distilling the water out of the pot, and then condensing it on the lid.

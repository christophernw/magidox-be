Some people choose to homeschool for religious reasons. Some prefer that their children be raised with certain values, morals, and standards for themselves that are not or cannot be taught in schools. Some homeschool because they want their children to love learning rather than have it thrown at them. Homeschooling is a chance for a child to learn in a completely unstructured environment, at his or her own pace. The possibilities for teaching new subjects are endless with homeschooling; you can teach science by growing a vegetable garden in the backyard or teach government by visiting the local, state, or national capitols and seeing laws being made. Homeschooling allows you your child to choose the subjects being taught; for example, if you don't speak another language but want your child to learn one, you can hire a tutor. Or do the same for a musical instrument. Homeschooled kids can be enrolled in local community colleges when they're old enough and start taking advanced maths or other courses long before they reach college age. . . In short, homeschooling is the chance for parents to be active participants in their children's educations and to make certain that their children are learning to love learning.

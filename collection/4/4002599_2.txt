We've been doing that since the Roosevelt administration.  The number of poor tend to increase with the amount of money spent on them.  Think of it on a personal level.  If someone gives you something, food/money etc., on a regular basis you start to expect it and deem yourself deserving.  Now if it were a close personal friend who gives to you, you may feel differently.  You would be thankful and wanting to help your friend in return.  The government is like a stranger handing out money on the corner.  Naturally you would want to take it and usually spend it unwisely since you didn't work for it.  Suppose the stranger hands out money once a month at that corner, it would be nice to quit your job and live off what is given to you freely.  Food and shelter are the basic needs of a person which everyone has the capability of providing for themselves.  It may take a little compremise or sacrifice to earn money but there are limitless opportunities to do that.

Its the amount of people that makes the difference of the 1st world from the 3rd world.If honestly done the survey of corruption in a society,I dont think the ratio would be any different fron one world to another.And why population increases,well thats a big field to study.Let me tell you a story--I cant remember the time,probably in the late seventies or early 8o's that New-york had a black-out in electricity for a couple of hours and that year,Newyork had a baby boom.Now consider the black-outs cause by lack of electricity in the poor countries-every day,every week,every month.What do you think will be the only entertainment people would enjoy.......?.....:-)

I will be honest with you my man, 90% of carsalesmen are out to get every cent that they can out of you.. I know this because I buy and sell cars (12yrs.).  The reason is because sales are far in between and most people want every doller they can get because that's how they eat.  If you are in the market for a car, let me know and I can e-mail you some stuff that will keep you from getting ripped off.

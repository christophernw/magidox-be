To have a fresher, younger, broader appeal.  "Kentucky Fried Chicken" doesn't roll off the toungue as fast (important in our ADD culture) and has old, Southern associations (old image of Colonel Sanders) that don't resonate with younger audiences which are critical for fast food restaurants.. . It also is easier to export "KFC" internationally b/c letters don't really require translation into other languages the way "Kentucky Fried Chicken" might.

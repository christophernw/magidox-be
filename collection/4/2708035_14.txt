I find it odd that you define "western society" in a way that implys not anything other than geography.  But "muslim society" is discerned by religion.  It would be fair to say that "Christian" "Jewish" "Hindu" societies cans say the same boasts in there "society".  Nobody thinks they belong to a group of murders and criminals. Isn't it also true Somalia is largly a "muslim" country and it is almost under complete anarchy.  In Iraq bombing of coalision forces could be considered acts of war but bombing others on the basis of different islamic factions on their own people is also a crime.  Aren't we all just people with the same faults?  Quit seperating in only causes more strife.

Today, today it is just an excuse for people to get together, eat a lot of good food they don't eat on a regular basis and be with family. It is traditional for Americans and we have always been taught the butterball meaning of it all with the Native Americans and Pilgrims getting together in harmony.. . It really didn't happen that way...but most people are offended when they learn what really happened. . . Regardless, today it is a time for family and recollection of how lucky we all are.

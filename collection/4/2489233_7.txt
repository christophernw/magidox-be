I gave these tips to another member today.. they'll help you lose lots of weights. may be not 20 but lots of it. . some other might have pointed this out.. but these are the tips.. 1. Improve your diet - You know which kinds of foods to eat and to not eat... for easy reference. Avoid starchy foods. Carbs are not bad for you watever your diet books says... its starch that you need to get rid of.. . 2. Avoid Aerobics : If you are doing 30-40 minutes of aerobics.. DON"T do it.. first thing. You'll lose weight by only raising your heartbeats at or above 75% of your max Heart beat rate. Aerobics don't do that.. . 3. Have at least one fast day in a week : Don't listen to all those who says it slows down metabolism.... Your body needs effectively 48 hrs before it slows down metabolism (or if you are doing something drastic to your body which gives the mechanism a shock ie. working out 4 hrs a day).. . 4. workout at least 5-6 days. minimum of 20 minutes. . You need to go into strict nutrition plan(I hate to call it diet as it restricts you). that means no oily, fluffy thingies. avoid starches, use lean meat etc... . Plan out your meals in advance. A good workout plus a fast day a week . if you can't do fast. I'll recommend 1 day cleanse. 1 day cleanse is easy You can do it in this manner. http://www.10minutesonly.com/toxin.html...

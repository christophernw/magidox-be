For years now spelling has taken a back seat to being able to color in and recoginize the appropriate circle to be blackened on a standardized test - this doesn't promote correct spelling just the recognition of it (I have teacher parents and they are frustrated too).  Also, this forum is world wide and some have not fully mastered the English language and its many quirks so those of us who have musts be patient with them as they try to put their question across the best they can.

sublime water is also called dry ice.. Dry Ice is frozen carbon dioxide, a gas which makes up about .04% of our atmosphere. As a gas, it is colorless and odorless, and is released when living organisms respire. It is also 1.5 times the density of air, (which is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and less than 1% argon.) Carbon dioxide (CO2 ) gas turns to dry ice when the temperature drops below minus 78.5Â° C. It turns to vapor directly from the solid state, never passing through a liquid phase. This change, from a solid to a gas, is called "sublimation.". . Dry ice is largely used for refrigeration. It is a good idea to wear gloves when handling the dry ice.

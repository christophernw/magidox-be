Could be lots of things.  If the cable or brake is sticking, then the brake may not be releasing and the light will stay on.  If this is the problem, it will often vibrate free once you get started and the light will go off.  It could be the sensor is bad, but then it would probably always be on as it would if the brake was stuck and not coming free.  Does it eventually go off or does it always stay on?  If it eventually goes off, I wouldn't worry about it.  If it stays on then I'd be more concerned because if the brake is not releasing you will wear out the pads and lose braking effectiveness over time.  Have a reputable mechanic check it.

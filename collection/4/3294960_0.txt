That really depends on the specific device.  Certainly nothing cooler than 50 degrees (Fahrenheit).  Though if you have a LCD or Plasma TV I would be leery about taking those below 60 degrees.  Though your computer could survive (off) pretty good in 40 degrees.  If you are intending to do this, when you come back and turn the heat on, let everything adjust to the warmer temperatures before you turn them on.

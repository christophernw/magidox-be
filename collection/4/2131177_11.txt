A nickle weighs 5 grams. So if you have some type of measuring device for weight that goes that low - weigh a nickle, and put that much creatine and you're all set. . . 5 grams is a weight, not an amount. If it's fluffy it would take a lot up in a scoop - if it were pressed down, it would take up little room in a scoop - so you can't go by "volume" which is what a scoop does. . . MP

What if your going over ocean? If you were to get off the plane where are u going to go? What if you landed in North Korea?. you know certain planes have boats/rafts. Why don't they have hot air ballons going ? Also parhute isn't effect because the altitude where u jumpoff from u are gonnaneed a oxygen mask and proper clothes and parchute so you won't be crahing into the white houe by a parchute failure over 100 miles per hour.

They should (for areas where minors have access).  Bars, I think could be exempted.  Beer=cigarette.  Any smoker who remembers not smoking will agree.  I quit (but started back).  I respect the space of others and don't smoke in the house anymore.  It is a nastyass habit.  They may tax it, but people who don't smoke should also have the right not to smell it or breathe it.

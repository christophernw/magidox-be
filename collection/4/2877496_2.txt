The old saying goes like this:. What is one man's trash is another man's treasure. What it means is that one person will throw something away because it means nothing to them (trash.) They usually have the means to buy something else. While another person would love to have the same item because they don't have it (treasure.) This generally means that the person can't afford to buy it.

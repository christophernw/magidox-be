I'd start out by saying something like people need to take responsibility for their actions and continuing to point a finger isn't going to fix anything.  It might be hard to admit that their kids did something bad cause then it might mean that they aren't being very good parents.  Pointing a finger of blame may be the easiest way for them to not admit they aren't doing a good enough of job.

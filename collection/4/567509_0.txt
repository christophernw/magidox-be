Educate your children in the correct use of CDs. If a CD is scratched and unplayble, tell your kids, they have to be more careful. If you give them pocket money (or other forms of allowance) let them re-buy the game from their own money. After a while they'll learn the value of games and (hopefully) be more careful.. And: Keep your games away from your kids...

I am not sure what you meant by that, hehe...  In my view, it started when someone discover that there are delicious mangos to eat and Buko juice is good to drink!  Oh, maybe the fishermen first found out that there are so many tasty fishes among the 7101 islands in this Pinoyland!  It is only natural when people found out how colorful and exotic the place is...

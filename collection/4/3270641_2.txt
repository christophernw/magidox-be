Solutes that are too polar or highly charged to diffuse through the lipid bilayer and are too big to diffuse through membrane channels can cross the plasma membrane by facilated difussion.In this process, a solute binds to a specific transporter on one side of the membrane and is released on the other side after the transporter undergoes a changhe in shape.. . Like diffusion, facilitated diffusion is a passive process.The net result of facilitated diffusion is movement down a concentration gradient.The solute binds more often to the transporter on the side of the membrane with a higher concentration of solute.Once the concentration is the same on the both sides of the membrane,solute molecules bind to the transporter on the cystolic side and move out the extracellular side and move into the cytosol.The rate of facilitated diffusion(how quickly it occurs) is determined by the stepness of the concentration gradient across the membrane.. . The number of transporters available in a plasma membrane places an upper limit,called the transport maximum,on the rate at which facilitated diffusion can occur.Once all the transporters are occupied, the transport maximum is reached, and further increase in the concentration gradient does not increase the rate of facilitated diffusion.Thus,much like a completely saturated sponge can absorb no more water,the process of facilitated diffusion exhibits saturation.. . Hope this helps you.Please check my spelling too.I may misspelled some words.So many too typed.No time to check it.. (^^o)/

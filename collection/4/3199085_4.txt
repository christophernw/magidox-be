I would politely insist that I am not interested and thanks for the call but I have to attend to some important business.. I was a telemarketer several times and I have to say that when people hang up its rude and we do call back again saying oh we were disconnected ..another one some of my fellow telemarketers did was call the ppl back and then hang up on them.. Also for those of you who have never been a telemarketer did you know we have all your info address and city everything so think about it next time you tell a telemarketer off on the phone your not that invincible...

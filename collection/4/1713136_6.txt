A university is usually comprised of multiple colleges, each of which offer different courses of study.  Universities also usually offer a full range of degrees including bachelor's, master's, and doctorate, in other words both undergraduate and graduate education.  . . Colleges carry the connotation of, at least historically, offering limited or specialized courses of study.  Examples in the US would be institutions that started as teachers colleges or the various A & M (Agriculture and Mechanical) colleges.  Many, like Texas A&M and the Ohio State University are now full fledged universities.

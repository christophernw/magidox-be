I would say that first you have to step back and see what your current job is.... . if you work at like McDonalds or Wendys,..... school is the way to go. . If you already have a decent job ($11/ hr or more) then you may only elect to go to school part-time in the evenings. . but it also depends on how much it costs for you to go to school & what Financial aid is avaliable (some scholarships or grants are only for full-time students). . do you already have many credits under your belt,.. if you do and are just there to finish a degree... if you only have 2 years to graduate,... go ahead and compete it full-time.. . *Ultimately,... it all depends,.... I work about 30 hours a week and take 9 hours at a state college. if that helps any

Go into a specialty adult type store (You know the ones with the toys).. I'm serious here... Get a type of lube called "Platinum Wet"- it is silicone based.. not water... also they may have even more types of things that are specifically for that type of special shave.  You might try shaving in the tub too.. might be easier to not be standing.... use short quick strokes (to shave... not the other) also use a type of shave cream called " Noxzema shave cream" ... it minimizes how often you have to shave by chemicals that prevent hair growth... you don't use it to shave (use the lube for that).. you rub a small amount of the shave gel on after you shave... and leave it on.... works well!  Also, ALWAYS dip your razor in alcohol to disinfect even on the first use.... helps prevent those bumps.... Oh one more thing, did you ask this question just to see how many people would respond & sound like they do shave that area?. . Oh, had to edit... DO NOT USE NAIR ON PRIVATES You are asking for trouble there.... that stuff isn't good for sensitive areas and it doesn't work well either.

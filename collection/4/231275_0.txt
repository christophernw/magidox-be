you must be quiet, avoid the rolls landing on the roof, and have a get-away driver ready.  First wrap the tree trunks, cars, and doorways for best results.  Second, toss the rolls over the lower branches first, and gradutally work your way to the top.  leaving extra "gifts" in the yard will help as well.

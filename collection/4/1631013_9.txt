It's a matter of choice, just as what God Himself has given us freedom of. You may not be alone with that way of thought or living, but most of you who believes the same way are humans who deny themselves a meaningful existence, if I come to think of it, atheistic ideologies are attributed from worldly observance of things, merely shallow and bleak. Atheist try to justify their reasons for being by earthly knowledge which is only limited and will not be as valid as what the truths and occurences in the Bible has foretold. Because the prophesies and events written on the Bible took place, even science can prove that. How much more God's definite promises for Christians who believe in Him?

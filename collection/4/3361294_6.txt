It may seem worrying i.e is he a pedo'? far from it there may be one single aspect that turns him on, mini skirt, white socks, any number of reasons, the bigger picture is he is looking for excitment, in what he feels has become a boring sexual script, if you feel uncomfortable with it don't do it, experiment with something you both feel comfortable with, meet him from work with a mini skirt and boots under a long coat, when he least expects it show him whats under the coat, even in a crowded place when no one is looking except him, you will change his train of thought from schoolgirls to whatever you have on, and he will realise that you are sexually exciting, as this is what he is realy looking for, a partner that can sometimes inject excitment into there relashionship

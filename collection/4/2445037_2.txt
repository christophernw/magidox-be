Ride the German train system, Deutsche Bahn. Its inexpensive, and a great way to see the countries, and you can go almost anywhere. It is almost always on time, and simple to ride. If you're really pressed for time, consider flying on EasyJet, or AirBerlin. Don't use the German Autobahn, unless its for reletively short drives, there is a lot of construction that really slows it down.

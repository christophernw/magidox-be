Because the unit step function is an anti-derivative of the delta function.. . Why? Because the definite integral of the delta function delta(t) is defined to be 0 if the interval of integration does not include t=0 and is defined to be 1 if the interval does include t=0. Using the unit step function to compute the definite integral will be consistent with this definition.. . Since the unit step function is an anti-derivative of the delta function, the delta function must be the derivative of the unit step function.

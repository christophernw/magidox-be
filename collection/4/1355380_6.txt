Let me ask you something? Why do you think the Israelis would want to spend so much money occupying a land which they can't live in? Why wouldn't they want to pull out being that if any jew walk's in there unarmed they will be killed within 2 minutes? The answer has to be solely to protect themselves otherwise it wouldn't be worth it. The international community understands this and the entire world Israel included anticipates the time they can pull out without anyone trying to kill their innocent civilians babies included.

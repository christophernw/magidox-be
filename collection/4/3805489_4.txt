FEMALE CATS CAN SPRAY!!!!! I watched mine do it and was amazed, stunned, and really pissed off! If you don't get cats fixed early enough they will/can spray!!

Six months is early enough to prevent the marking you might want to take her to the vet. I've been told that crystals  in her urine is a cause for them to spray. It's worth checking out

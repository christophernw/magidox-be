Aircraft now days have Turbofan engines and we don't fly fast enough to make a sonic boom. They are and can still happen. Military jets go way past sonic speeds. Military planes have turbojets, which was the first type of a jet engine. Turbojets engines were LOUD and very smoky. They put those in fighter jets. But commercial aircraft don't fly fast enough. Miltary planes make sonic booms all the time.

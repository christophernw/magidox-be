Well , i saw this commercial for a "graphic design" school on tv and the phrase "Not an artist? it doesn't matter anymore..." , so i'm thinking that a graphic designer uses computer aided stuff to put layouts and stuff together from programs where they can extract stuff , and an actual graphic artist is one who's had some art training and can come up with their own design without the help of a computer..

It is more than just tax savings.  It depends on when you pay your taxes, you pay taxes when you put money in or when you take it out.  Personally I think it's better to pay taxes when you put the money in.  The real benefit is you can put money away all of your life and only have it when you retire. If properly invested, you can make the money grow very quickly.  And since most of us won't have social security when we retire, you'll need some source of income.

You probably have an older PS2 and the laser and mostly all them went bad and did this to millions of people including myself. You can take apart your ps2 and clean the lens with alcohol or something and hope it works, also a clean game is better. look up DRE on a gaming forum and it will tell you all about it and what to do.

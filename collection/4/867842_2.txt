Where do you think the 10 billion dollars that the drug companies got for the Medicare Bill. It came from our taxes. What about not being able to negotiate the price of the drugs. We pay for the higher prices. We all need to wake up and see these so called tax cuts are just a tax deferments that our children and grandchildren are going to be stuck with. We are borrowing 2 billions dollars a day just to make the economy look good!

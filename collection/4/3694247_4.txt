It should cost you about $100 to have a lawyer write him a letter and tell him that he is full of sh*t - let him know you're willing to spend as much for an attorny as he is trying to hijack you for - as a matter of PRINCIPLE - also, tell him you'll write a letter to the editor of the local newspaper and explain the situation to the general public - also, report him to the BBB and the chamber of commerce - and if you think there are any potential hazardous conditions on his property - you can report him to the state Health Dept. and the EPA.  I got a landlord once (unintentionally) by reporting "bad" well water - it was in fact discovered to be "FOULED" - AND THE EPA MADE HIM CLEAN IT UP. AT HIS EXPENSE.  GOOD LUCK!

First of all, STOP N' GROW does NOT work!!.   One day you'll wake up and you'll be ready to stop biting. A habit is made in doing something simultaneously 20 times. So "deny" yourself 20 times and a small habit will be formed. .   In the process, remember to reward yourself with manicures and moisturizing products. Sooner or later, you'll be choosing lovely colors of polish to shine up your newly grown nails!

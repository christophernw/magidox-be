It can be classified into two aspects. I read because I want to learn more new and difficult vocabularies. Sometimes, I will read up to the climax of the story and imagine what will happen next, also I will make up a new ending that is sensible enough and related to the story, it helps me improve my writing skills. Reading helps me improve in the academic results..      "Reading is Fun", and I agree with this. Because it is exciting to read the detective stories, the ghost stories, so on and so on, I can relax and it's a kind of leisure for me.

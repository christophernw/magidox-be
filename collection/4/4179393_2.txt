Biologically speaking would be the traits we receive from each of our parents. (If a parent is great in playing an instrument, excellent chances the child will be highly likely to be also).Our personalities are formed normally by the age of 5. What our care givers have taught us, is what we will know and feel, including fear. Our minds are like sponges. There are three different kinds of personalities: Aggressive, Passive, and Assertive, as our mind grow-it will lean towards one of the three, depending on the parents personalities, and HOW the child is being taken care of. Each personality has it's own form of self-esteem. Instincts are our "gut/heart" feelings. Which has been scientifically prov en to be 99% true to truth. The more knowledge/wisdom a person gains in life, the broader their horizon. The more a person loves/likes themselves, the happier they will be.

Stand next to the horse and put your hands on the withers.  Gently rock the horse from side to side, and they square up almost perfect.. . You can use your riding crop to give a gentle tap to the leg that is not in the proper position.  Just tap tap tap until the leg moves, and stop tapping the instant you see the slightest try in the horse.

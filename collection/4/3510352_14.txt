Easy, contact DEFRA and report him as keeping a pig wothout a licence. Contact the environmental health dept of the council and tell them the same. You are not allowed to keep cloven hoofed animals without a herd number and holding number and I bet he hasn't got either..  The env' health will deal with it on smell grounds especially if any effluent leaks onto your property.

I've noticed they don't teach logic classes or ever use the word "fallacy" any time during Sunday School.. . Though I did pick up a tract today "disproving" the Da Vinci Code.  It was actually very convincing, but it was sort of like a book explaining why Santa Claus's sleigh has to be red and why he can only use flying reindeer as opposed to flying horses.

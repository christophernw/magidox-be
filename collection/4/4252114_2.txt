Hm, interesting. However after reading the Bible as well as actively going to church and taking many liberal and conservative christian classes in college to understand the Bible better, I still don't believe in Jesus as the son of god. And I gotta tell you, if after all that I still know he's not the son of god, nor will he save me from hell for all eternity, then I really doubt that this forum will be the thing that finally converts me. . . Getting a little 'good news' from Christians has been near impossible from this site, mainly because they feel that they can be more forceful about their beliefs online. Here's to perhaps a Christian or two perhaps gaining some reason from my silly atheistic ramblings!

first off, thoroughly wash and air out the basket and maybe spray it with Ozium or Febreze...then get an old shirt or something that only smells like you and put it in the basket for kitty and move the bed to a new spot so it does not have any bad associations...you may have to move it a few times before kitty finds a spot she likes for it...good luck!

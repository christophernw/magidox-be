My goodness.. . The Clit, short for CLITORIS is the "female" analogy of the penis. It's a organ made of tissue which becomes engorged when excited... and who's function is believed by experts, to be for PLEASURE only.  It's made of the same cells that develop into a penis, if you have the "Y" Chromosome.. . Most woman find it difficult to impossible to obtain an orgasm, if it's not stimulated in some direct or indirect way.. . I hope that helps.

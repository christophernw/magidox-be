Do you mean provide care for her to make it "easier" on her or do you mean "take care of her" as in get rid of her??  I hope you mean how the better help her, and the truth is there is nothing that you can really do she is well suited to handle it on her own and doesn't need the "pampering" that humans do.  Cats love  warm secluded areas to deliver their babies, why not put a cardboard box with blankets in it in the back or a closet of somewhere like that for her?  Give her plenty of fresh water and check with your vet about any special foods.

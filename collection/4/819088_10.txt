A guy I worked with used this word when talking about some of his friends, and I asked him about it. To paraphrase his response, he said that it was a disparaging word used to put people like him down for years, and by people of his ethnicity using the word among themselves it took a little bit of sting from the word and made the word not seem as hurtful, mean spirited, or derogatory. Since I am white, the word would still have a hurtful, mean spirited, and derogatory meaning if I were to say it since I had never experienced being called that name.

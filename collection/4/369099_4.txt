I'm not sure Bush personally taps phones and screen emails.  He's just making it so our intelligence agencies can to protect us from another terrorist attack.  Everyone is pissing and moaning about their civil liberties being violated.  Personally, I don't mind losing a bit of privacy or being inconvenienced at an airport if it means I won't be blown to little pieces by an Islamic nutjob whose religion tells him it's his duty to kill me if I refuse to be a muslim.

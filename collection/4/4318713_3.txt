Although there are a number of theories as to why it is said, the earliest mentions do not explain and so it is a true mystery.. . Why is it that we salute a person when he sneezes, an observation which Tiberius Caesar, they say, the most unsociable of men, as we all know, used to exact, when riding in his chariot even? -Pliny, Natural History, 77 CE. . 'Bless you, my dear!' he said, and 'bless you, bless you!' at the second and third sneeze. -Apuleius, Golden Ass, 150 CE . . Is it possible as Snopes mentions, "...Are we trying to protect the sneezers from evil spirits? Are we fending off the Devil? Is this a remnant of an ancient recognition that sneezers aren't long for this world, thus we commend their souls to God even as we wash our hands of them? Are we congratulating them on their impending good luck? (As silly as this may sound now, sneezing was at one long-ago time seen as a fortuitous portent.) ". . People will continue to speculate, but it will always remain a mystery, unless and until new evidence is discovered sometime in the future.

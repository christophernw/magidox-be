I agree. Atheists tend to be very celf-centered, which is understandable from their point of view. They don't believe in an afterlife, so all they have (they think) is this short life on Earth. And if that's all you're going to have then it's easy to get in a "me, me, me" mode. I feel sorry for them and pray each day that God will open their eyes before it is too late.

Wish I could tell you for sure, but what worked for me is this:. . Change your schedule slowly and gradually. Add a little walking, then a little cardio, then a little more. And don't eliminate chocolate and cakes etc. Wean yourself down to a reasonable indulgence. . . Man wasn't mean to live on health food alone. Treat yourself once per week and moderate it, and consider it your reward for having some exercise all week.. . Walking every day and good strong cardio three times per week is what you're working up to, increasing duration and intensity as you go. After one month, as long as you stick to it, you'll have developed a good habit you'll stick with.. . To keep yourself on it, put a reminder everywhere of what your goal is. Put it on the fridge door, the cabinets, your closet, everywhere. The note should remind you that you want to lose weight and you need to exercise and that your treat day isn't until whenever it is.. . Good luck! I know the position you're in and I hope you succeed!

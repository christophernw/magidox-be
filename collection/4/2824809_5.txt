It's generally money you receive for Pensions, Social Security or any fixed amount of money that is providing you with your main financial support. Many people use the term for money amounts that will never change (ie; not go up with inflation)........ . It can be low or high... but it is "fixed" (stays the same).. . It would not be your paycheck, since this amount can change by raises, promotions or losing the job (etc).. . Hope this helps!

There's not much etiquette standards on IMing... Just look at how people (mainly teens I should say) type on there! "lol", "ttyl", "omfg", there should be a whole dictionary for the junk I get sent on there. . . As for the multitasking thing all I can say is don't have a massive buddy list: if your friends see that you're on they're gonna send you an IM if they're on too. It's just how it works.

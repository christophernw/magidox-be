well you have a few options.  you can start treating yourself better and maybe do a little pampering on a regualr basis like get a massage or a pedicure n manicure and start eating healthy and drinking more water.  You can also take a different route and go see your doctor or a doctor and see what they can do...which is probably what they do best---prescribe drugs (yuk)

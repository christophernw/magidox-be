warm your hands first. seriously. and you want to be beside it, not behind it. bathe the udders with warm water (not soap)first, this gets rid of any debris you don't want falling into the milk, and helps relax the udders to let down the milk...then grab hold...gently but firmly, two at a time...kind of pull and squeeze...you'll figure it out pretty quick, make sure you get all the milk from each nipple, or she may end up with mastitis

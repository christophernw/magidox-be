because everything bothers us. I have COPD which for me means mild emphysema, chronic bronchitis and some hailacious asthma.. . With he pollution level as bad as it is in our state, Texas, the last few days I have been miserable, short of breath and wheezing like someone who sounds like they're ready to fall over dead LOL!!. I know when I start feeling like this I need to go to the Dr or Emergency Room and get  A shot in the hip of  solumedral and then increase my prednisone for a while.. Point is--you have to take care of yourself---Listen to your body--and when you are feeling really bad go to the Dr or emergency room.. . Good Luck and please take care of that asthma

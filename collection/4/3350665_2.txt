All air is "wet" in a natural state.  A key component to the mechanical cooling process it the removal of moisture from the air in the form of condensation.  Compare the air conditioner to the cold glass on a table.  The glass sweats.  Air conditioning works basically the same way just causing a lot more condensation.

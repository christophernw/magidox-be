All these answers here is wrong, its bascially crude oil that is found in the ground, how is if found is like this:. animals and plants (includinh humans) who are die and are buried in the ground (most animals arn't buried in the ground, after they did they eventually get eaten by bacteria and become a part of the earth), after millions of years, these animals and plants (after they decomposed) it turns to crude oil... . . Now to get gas that the car uses, the cooking oil and other different oils like diesel, kerosine, etc... . YOu heat crude oil to a certain degree to get each one of these things.. All these oils have different heating temperatures for them to produce. . . . Other oils like Ethanol, comes from corn, etc... Propane is a three-carbon alkane. It is derived from other petroleum products during oil or natural gas processing. It is commonly used as a heat source for engines, barbecues, and homes. Its name was derived from propionic acid.

It all sucks. I was in the same situation. I had to use my parents income for my financial aid. Your not considered independent until your are 24 years of age. Then you can use only your income for your financial aid. However, once you turn 24 and become independent, you cannot make over $21,000 or so a year. If you do, you will not get approved for financial. At least through www.FAFSA.gov It happened to me this year. I guess they figure if you can live on your own, then you can pay for school too. NOT TRUE!  I know what your going through and it sucks. It's just how the government works and it doesn't work very well in my point of view. They could be doing so much more, but they are much too greedy. So now I have to take out student loans and try to pay for school that way, which just becomes more of a pain in the long run. Good luck to you. I would recommend looking for scholarships. There are scholarships for just about anything. www.scholarships.com is a great site. Good Luck!

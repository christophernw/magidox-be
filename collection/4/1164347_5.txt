Go to town hall the assessors office get a copy of the street card the price may be on there. If not find the volume and page numbers on the street card go to the clerks office and look it up in the volume the deed is recorded in. You can also check the day book in the vault if you know around what date it was purchased it would be helpful.. The other way is to look it up in the commercial record news paper again know the date or just look up in your area newspaper. Your area newspaper is the hardest because you don't know when it was reported so there might be more searching necessary.. If an agency sold it call them and see if they will tell you what it closed for that is public knowledge but you might get drilled from the agent.. . Make it easier ask the new owners!

I used to suffer from migraine's regularly and stopped eating certain foods such as cheese and chocolate  for two years but it made no difference...then i started about three years ago taking homoeopathic medicine for hormone related problems and the headaches have stopped...it's worth looking into hormonal problems whatever your age...nurofen won't help a migraine, also stress can cause severe headaches which can be confused with mig..did you know there are different types of mig,,,like cluster mig where it can last for a week and you feel really ill , like sick and your whole system is upset....i hope you find some relief very soon...just remembered, have you tried migraleve? pink ones to stop nausea and yellow ones if pain persists, but with mig different people have different symtoms...hope this helps....will be thinking of you....

You can start by learning how to spell liberal.  Then you can work your war from there.  Problem is, they, like conservatives are quite narrow-minded and only accept views of those who think similarly.  They do not compromise or give way to reason in any way, shape, or form, much like their less progressive counterparts on the other side of the aisle.  They believe the way they think is the one true way of looking at the world.  All is black and white with no gray in between.  If you want to educate a liberal or a conservative, you need to make them see the other sides of arguments they don't usually look at.

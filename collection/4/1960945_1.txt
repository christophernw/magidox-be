In general, though, a smoker's chances of developing cancer depends on:. . The age that the person began smoking. . How long the person has smoked. . How many cigarettes per day the person smokes. . . Passive smoking - breathing in someone else's smoke - may also increase the risk for developing lung cancer.. . The main symptoms of lung cancer are coughing up blood and coughing that does not seem to improve and gets worse with time. Other symptoms are chest pain, shortness of breath, recurrent episodes of pneumonia, weight loss, and feeling tired.. . Lung cancer is diagnosed with x-rays, an analysis of sputum (material a person coughs up), and biopsy of tissue from the lung.

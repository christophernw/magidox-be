Since I have been living in China, my wife has educated me to the system of recycling. But it goes much deeper than that, it is called helping China. Lei Feng is a famous man of the early days of Chinese Communism. According to his teachings, if it is broken, fix it and use it. If a screw, nut, or bolt are on the ground, pick it up to be used. If it is trash, separate it and make good trash. By the way, it does not gain much money; but it does gain self respect and a feeling you have done your part.

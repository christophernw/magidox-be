you need to flush your kidneys. Drink a few glasses of cranberry juice and about 10 litres of water every day for several weeks. Also use ural, to alter the ph of your urine. By a test kit from your local chemist (or drug store if you live in seppo land, a.k.a usa) and see if you are clean.. . This only works if you have quit using drugs and are now seeking employment. You have to stop using them.. . There are plenty of online sites that sell powdered urine.. . But seriously, stop using the stuff. Go for a jog, write stories, join a local community group and go out and clean up the envrionment. Do something else with your time and money. Study, coach little league.. You'll feel better for it. I know i did.. . Abstenance is easiest.

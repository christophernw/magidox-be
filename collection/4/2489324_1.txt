Interpersonal skills are very much on the decline because of how we communicate now adays. Emailing & texting is an excuse for poor communication & the true meaning of a message is often lost in bad grammar or punctuation. It's also about empathy & caring & society doesn't encourage that either. I believe that we will end up as a generation that lost its ability to communicate effectively & once that goes, it will be a free for all.

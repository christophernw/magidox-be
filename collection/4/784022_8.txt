I am a paranormal investigator and have caught many things on tape.ghost can actually appear any time of day it is just easier for them at night. less counter energy to contend with.they are in another dimension after all.and for them to apear in this one and affect things in this plane of existence requires lots of energy. except on halloween when the realms mesh and it is very easy for them to interact. ask some people who worked halloween night if they saw anything. happen..and if the place where you work has security cameras and know someone in the security department ask to watch the tapes. there is bound to some cool stuff happen on them... . http://www.kiestronics.com/nwopis

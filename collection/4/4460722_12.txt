Don't switch to diet...it's horrible for you to. You just simply have to stop. Think about what you are doing to your body by drinking so much soda...rotting teeth, bad kidneys, erroded esophagus, risk of diabetes, bad skin. Is it worth it? Also, think of the money you spend on soda...what else could you buy with that?. Once you mentally prepare yourself you can stop. Drink lots of water and nothing else...to help with the headaches you may get from stopping the sodas, eat a banana or some almonds whenever you find yourself feeling ill. Then force yourself to do some kind of activity that takes your mind off your craving.. Good luck and I hope that you're on your way to becoming a healthier person!

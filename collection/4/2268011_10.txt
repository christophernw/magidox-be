r u muslim?????. there r only 1 god in islam,muhammad is a prophet,no more no less,allah has 99 names doesnt meant that there are 99 gods in islam. zaidiyah is one of shiah branches.shiah is not acceptible in islam. you worship ali as if he is the holy prophet himself,what about abu bakr, umar, and usman,they r also caliphs just like ali. you know nothing about the holy koran and islam,you dont learn history,you dont even know why the caliphs removed the reference to the Banat. how can you asked such a question? if  the true islamic law still practised today, you r now dead.

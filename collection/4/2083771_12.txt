no dog likes to sit in urine. Depending on her age - take her out at least every 4 hours. When you take her out TAKE her out. Tell her "go pee" until she does...then praise her lots. If she drinks within about 20 minutes she WILL have to pee so if she's coming in, drinking then going in the crate she can't help it. Have a safe place for her to be outside and when you know she has to go (after drinking, first thing in the morning etc) LEAVE HER OUT until she goes. Take up the water about 4 hours before bed time - take her out and (consistently) tell her "go pee". I've done several dogs that way and each one "pees on command" or so it seems to others. If she's really young - under 3 months - 4 hours is a stretch...but be consistent. If you start at 3 hours keep at 3. Watch for signs she has to go - sniffing, anxious...if it's been a while since she's been out take her out.

You can hand deliver it and ask for an interview.  This is the most effective way of getting your resume noticed.  Otherwise, you can always ask someone who works at the company/store/business to forward it to the appropriate contacts.  If you cannot find anybody, you can always mail it, email it, or submit it through the employer's website.

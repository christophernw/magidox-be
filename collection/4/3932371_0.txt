Because it is already defensive....or maybe I should say offensive...it begins by excluding a group of people ( non-christians) which reeks of judgement ( only those  "good christians" will understand that) and sets the tone as one full of higher morals(judgement again...hhhmm recurring theme?) and that damn "holier than thou" attitude that so often comes along with "good christians".. When Christ was actually around I don't think he seperated himself from anyone with a phrase..."oh, as the son of god.... I think...." he said we are all the same.... much nicer than his followers I am afraid to say...

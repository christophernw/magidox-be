It's not that smart people ask these questions to prove their smart... these types of questions aren't neccesarily being asked by smart people.. . The guy may be a super-geek and want to see if he can MacGyver his computer and TV together. Perhaps he's a cheap skate that doesn't want to buy a new monitor, and he's got an old 15inch TV set sitting in his closet.. . I was actually kinda wondering the same thing about hooking a computer to a TV, I just never asked. I kinda think it would be cool to have a computer screen up on a large 32inch TV (better yet a 60inch plasma) so that way you don't have to squint at a tiny screen.. . People don't ask complex questions on Yahoo Answers, to make people feel dumb. They ask because there's a chance that somewhere in the world there's someone that will see their question and say "Hey I know the answer to that!" and that person will impart that knowledge to the rest of us wondering the same thing.

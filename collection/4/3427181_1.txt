Internal recruitment is when a company offers a newly open job postion to it's own employees to apply for before it goes to the public domain for applicants. . . If you are a big company then often you can hire somebody from another department to do a different job if they are not happy at thier current position, they seem to have potential or just want a change. This gives the employee oppritunitys and gives the company the advantage of not having to hire somebody fresh off the street or from another company.

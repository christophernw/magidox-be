Unfortunately, it mostly boils down to the fact that our country is large and fairly separated from any other "non-English" countries, except for Mexico.  The entirety of Europe, for example, fits inside the area of the US easily, and there are many, MANY languages in that continent whereas there's really only English in the US.  I'm an American and I do speak another language, incidentally, but I had to take and make the effort to do so and learn it (but I love being bilingual).

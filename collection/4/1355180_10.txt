I'd like to know why too.. my effexor XR has done the same thing in combination with Buspar. The depression is gone, but now I just get angry really easily over stupid stuff!! I am seeing my doctor MOnday. You should do the same. As for these idiots who are saying that pills will not fix the real problem of why your angry they have NO CLUE what depression is all about or else they would'nt be so f-ing stupid and say something like that. When you have a chemical imbalance as we do, you have to keep trying different medications until you find one that levels you out and makes you feel normal. "Normal" is perceived differently by everone individually. It does suck until you find the one medicine that works for you. You need a good support system and maybe some counseling during that time because your hormones go all wacky while your body is adjusting and re-adjusting from different meds. A chemical imbalance can make you feel things way differently than ppl without one. Every little thing seems the size of a mountain and all you want to do is scream half the time. I know. Go see your doc again. Hope I helped a little. Good luck to you!

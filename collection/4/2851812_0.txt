There is a few agencies for this like Cars on film etc, but I have heard many bad reports of cars being damaged. Nobody loves the car like you do, and the people using them are not enthusiasts - they just want a quick shot and thats it. I've heard of some peoples rare cars being destroyed too.. I certainly would not consider letting any of mine being used, regardless of how much they pay.

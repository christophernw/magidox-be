the only way to stop the war in iraq is that the USA should keep increasnig their numbers of their troops in iraq. US marines, paramilitary, CIA agents, etc. should be in huge numbers, on all the streets of major iraqi cities. I think some of you guys also need to go there on part of US troops. Just go there and you'll find people standing with smiling faces and open arms waiting for you with bunches of dark red roses, coloured with their own blood, they'll welcome you and tell you how  great that idea was to attack iraq in 2003. they'll also say, now its your turn to keep enjoy these high moments of estacy of blood bath.

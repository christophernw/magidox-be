Within the context of the military the lower ranked people would not be called sir.  . . However, in normal day to day life (ie: you are wait staff helping military people of any sort male or female) sir/ma'am and other polite behavior should rule.  . . Also, if you are NON-military personnel, for example working on a military base as a secretary, you are not required to salute or things like that.  However, calling your boss Sir or Commander would be the correct thing to do.  You would not call these people "Mr Smith".  Again, believe me, people will let you know what to call the higher ups. . . If you are actually IN the military, don't worry, it will be made clear to you how to refer to people.  SIR YES SIR!

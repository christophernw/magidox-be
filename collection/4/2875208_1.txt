the interface between the tibia and femur is the knee joint.the knee joint is enclosed in a capsule. usually this capsule contains a minimal (5ml) of fluid. in the conditions which "curious luther" named, the capsule will swell with reactive synovial fluid. this differs from other swellings in that the fluid is inside the knee joint and not between the tissue cells.. . please feel free to contact me if you have problems. . i work in the government sector and my services are free.

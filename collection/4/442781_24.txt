1st it is taught in many high schools as an individual class and in college/ university classes but the real answer is we should be taught values, morals and ethics from day one of our lives.  In this day and age their are many examples of bad and good wherever we look-  TV sitcoms- movies- books and the news.  It is our own responsibility  to be responsible human beings.  The ten commandants are a good start- and interacting w/ upstanding citizens will also help-- remember it is better to give than receive-  it feels good so learn by doing and treat people the way you would want to be treated.

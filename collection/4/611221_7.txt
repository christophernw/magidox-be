my mate has one called Frank! they are a bit dopey and run like they've been smokin something they shouldn't. they do take a lot of care and only live about 9 years cos they're so big but only have little hearts.if you want a dog that plays...DON'T get a greyhound like i've got.he's great but a right boring bugger!

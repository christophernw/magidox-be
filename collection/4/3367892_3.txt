depends on what molecule it is. There are plenty of molecules that have a different number of hydrogen atoms.. . Hydrogen has one electron which it can form bonds with, hydrogent can only form one bond to other elements. So for water you havr hydrogen and oxygen, oxygen can form two bonds, therefore can bond to two hydrogen atoms giving H2O.. . hope this helps

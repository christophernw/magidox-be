my 9 year old rottie sometimes piddles in her cage out of spite.. i honestly think she does it to drive me crazy sometimes... i willt ake her out before we leave...let her get it alllllllll out and put her in the cage (which is rather large, not that you think i cram her intoa  tiny cage) and turn around - and she's piddled all over the place!

For some reason you are really letting this kid get under your skin.  Seems like you just don't like him much, so that only intensifies your annoyance when he does things like mimic you.  You are still dwelling because it truly bothers YOU that you are allowing a 14 year old to bother you.......try and relax when he is around or just walk away.....next time tell him to grow up.....try not to stoop to his level by name calling.....

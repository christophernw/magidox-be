God didn't kill that girl. The drug did. God gives everyone free will. She used her free will to take the drug that killed her. If you want someone to blame, blame Lucifer (devil,satan,evil,ect.) for putting the temptation in front of her. And if you were strong in your faith you would know that she is in a much better place than here with us.

it's not that bad, kids will only get away with what you let them.  if you want control be completely firm with them, no false promises, don't give an inch or they will take a yard.  or you can go a different route and try to relate with them on their level...student's act completely different around subs than with their teachers, teachers have more of a chance to get them into routines then subs etc..i know of subs that carry around discipline referrals so that the students can see that they mean business.  really, don't even stress out about it, just focus on the job at hand..and the paycheck at the end of the day.

Out of nothing came everything. Of course, there are people that will say there was something before that. So what did that come out of? To explain this paradox, we define a creator as God. Sorry, all you religious fanatics, but God isn't just Christian, or Muslim, or Hindu. God doesn't even have a specific gender. As a collective whole we have made God into our image in an effort to understand "Him," and I say him only because I don't want to say it, and don't have another word that would provide a conveyable description (although some people say "the creator" ). I accept that we can call this creator, God and to be able to talk amongst ourselves easily, I also accept saying him. However, I don't care if someone calls the creator Her, Fred, Your Royal Heinnie, whatever, because God is different to each individual. I don't think anyone fully understands God because if they did they probably wouldn't be human (so, it doesn't really make sense, but hopefully you get what I'm trying to say). God is our definition of creator of all things we don't understand, and we specifically like to say proof of god is verified by the beauty we see in such things as a baby's smile, the trees, and earth. Oh, and of course his sense of humor in the platypi (if that's a word).

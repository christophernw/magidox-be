Depreciation and amortization are both non-cash items.  So, when you create a profit and loss statement, you are allowed to deduct these expenses before taxes, but then pull them back out when calculating your cash flows.  . . Depreciation is a common expense of any business with assets.  Amortization is much less common, only showing up on the financial sheets of some of the larger public companies with regular R&D programs that amortize their investments over the life of a project.  Maybe amortization is used at other times, but I haven't seen it personally.  (When discussion depreciation and amortization together, we're usually talking about profit and loss statements, not amortizing a loan.  This second kind of amortization is only used for breaking out interest expenses from principle expenses, pulling the interest out of the P&L in the interest account, and the principle from the liability balances on the balance sheet).. . Good luck

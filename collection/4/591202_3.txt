Mdigitale is right.. Anything that could be use to transmit information can not go faster than light. . Reminds me of the Darkon theory. Particles come out and make things dark. The sun comes up and absorbs the dark, light bulbs absorb darkons as well and the proof is when they quit working they are full of Darkons. They can only absorb so much.. Darkons travel at the speed of light.

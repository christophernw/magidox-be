declaw it or you can get those things called SoftPaws that you can put on their claws.  that is basically the only way...unless you can somehow scare the crap out of it everytime it gets near the couch...that should keep it away!  I have a leather sofa and 2 declawed kitties.  They are happy and have not missed their claws!

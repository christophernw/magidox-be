Well when I was six years old, I had sex with the guy across the street from me (he was six too) I had two girldfriends before I came to the conclusion that the reason why I just didn't feel "sexually" attracted to girls is that I'm gay. I have had two boyfriends since... It is a little hard for me to understand Bi people, because I just don't understand how someone could be basicly attracted to both...IDK but everyone is diffrent and they deal with it in their own way....

Jeez, this is the biggest logical fallacy there is.  It's used quite often by Dick Cheyney and he will always claim that terrorists are using midterm elections to their advantages.  Because we all know that the democrats all love terrorists!  Not to mention, we know that the terrorists have their calanders marked right after Ramadan to say "highten terror for U.S. mid-term elections."  They used this tactic somewhat effectively against Senator John Kerry in 2004 to say that the U.S. would be vulnerable to terrorists if he was in office.  Such a load of crap.. . If the democrats were smart, they would use "voting for republicans is voting for torture!"

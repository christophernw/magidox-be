do you know the Aesop story of the cold North wind and the sun having an argument as to which was the strongest?   They decided to have a competition and see who could remove the coat from a man walking down the street.. . The north wind blew his strongest but all the man did was hold his coat tighter to him.. . The sun beamed her strongest.   The man took off his coat, and his shirt.. . This proves that heat is stronger than the cold!. . (in actuality, I think it is the two working together, one after the other, that causes the most damage.   for example, to split rocks, water falls into crevasses, the cold freezes it, splitting the rock.   The heat melts the water, letting the rock relax, the cold freezes the water, increasing pressure, heat melts it and so on, working like bending a piece of metal backwards and forwards until it snaps.). . I hope you liked the story! (actually, the moral of the story is that kindness works better than threats!)

Basically The government of South Vietnam fell. It was held up by The US government and not really self sufficient. The result was very bad at first but when the government stabilized Vietnam eventually recovered. The worst problem and the one we should have taken note of was in Cambodia where Pol Pot killed three million  people in a genocide of unimaginable magnitude.The Khmer Rouge government was at war with Vietnam as well. But this government run by the evil Pol Pot  was so bent on genocide and the removal of intellectuals and the middle class that they raise the bar  for cruelty. The whole of South East Asia was left in ruins. . What the US learned was that we really did not understand these people and we did not have the skills to go about placing Democracy in countries that were so backward. However with the dawn of George Bush and his group of lame brains we have repeated the same errors in the middle East. When you fail to understand a culture you should only act to prevent genocide and it should be done unilaterally.

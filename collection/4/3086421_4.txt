Sex is not any different from sexual intercourse. The only other definition of sex that comes to mind is gender identity. . If penetration occured, indeed the two of you had sexual intercourse, if not then no you didn't.. I mean no offense, but if your boyfriend can't distinguish the difference, perhaps he isn't ready to be doing this.. Tell him to look the two definitions up in a dictionary.

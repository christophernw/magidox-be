I'll assume that, since you call it a "merry" rather than "happy" Christmas, you're from the U.S..... . Stores have to cater to the many millions of Americans who aren't Christian.  For example, there now are as many Muslims in the U.S. as there are Jews, and there are huge contingents of Buddhists, Shintoists, Taoists, Hindus and more.  They all celebrate a secular holiday at Christmastime, but they don't celebrate CHRIST-mas in the religious sense.  In a desire not to seem overbearing, these businesses have stressed the "holiday" spirit of the season, trusting that their Christian customers will insert the religious subtext for themselves.. . When you say "and everything," I assume that you're referring to other institutions, like government agencies and businesses other than retail stores.  Non-retail businesses have to consider the feelings of their customers in the same way that retail businesses do, although not in as showy a manner; they also have to be careful about the feelings of their employees.  The government, of course, is bound by the U.S. Constitution to leave religion to churches and individuals, and keep it out of government.  In earlier times, when the vast majority of U.S. citizens happened to be Christian, it simply didn't occur to the government that religious references to Christmas (even down to government-sponsored Nativity displays) might cross that line.  Today, when many American citizens practice faiths brought by themselves or their ancestors from non-Christian lands, courts have held that the government has to be a bit more rigorous in its separation of church and state.

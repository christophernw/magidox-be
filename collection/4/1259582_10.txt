Gen6:21 says that he took all the food with him.  What we don't know is how many animals there were.  We just know that there were at least 2 of every kind, not every variation of species.. . Also, animals like bears, etc go into hybernation periods where they don't eat for months.  It could be that the animals were in a hybernation mode most of the time.  Also, the animals would be babies.  This would make sense because babies sleep alot, they stand the best chance for survival, they eat less and they would live longer afterwards so they could produce more offspring.. . For the person that mentioned the inbreeding, please explain how the evolution theory doesn't require inbreeding?  I'd say you should learn more about your own beliefs before trying to debunk something you know nothing about.. It takes less faith to believe in the story of Noah than it does to believe that all life came from non-living material in a completely random process.

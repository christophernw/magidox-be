well i do traditional folk dancing so my moves are not so handy for every style, but jumping to the rhythm, or just waving your hands from side to side make you seem dancing, but i guess that is not all you want. i would suggest to dance how you feel and do not care about the others watching you, with dance you express yourself. and for you dancing more professionally try some dance schools, they make a dancer from everybody.

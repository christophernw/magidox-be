I used to not only be a vegetarian, I used to be a vegan (one who consumes absolutely no animal products at all).. . I was a vegan, because I thought that the diet was much healthier for a person's body, as well, I am highly concerned about animal rights. It bothers me to think of consuming animal products mindlessly. . . I am no longer a vegan, nor a vegetarian, though, because I lost far too much weight (I didn't have any to lose in the first place), and in doing so, I found out that I was on my way to being diabetic.  I am much healthier on a diabetic diet now, which includes meats and dairy.. . I struggled with the issues for quite some time before I came to the conclusion that everyone's body is different (umm.. eureka?) and that a vegan or vegetarian diet was certainly not healthy for all people, decidedly me.. . I just eat with awareness now, and I give (silent or in prayer) thanks to the poor animal that suffered in order that I might be kept alive from their remains. It sounds awful, and yes, I still struggle, but there's no other way for me.. . Hope this helps.

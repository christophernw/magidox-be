BS!  America gives more financial aid and other resources to the rest of the world than anyplace else on the planet. Look at all of the coutries that still owe us a bunch of money from WWII and will probably never pay it back! We still give handouts all over the place and face too much ingratitude for it.. . America is rich because it has many  natural resources and people smart enough to know how to use them.

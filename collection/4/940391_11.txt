Because it is part of growing up. They are reaching an age where they can think, and as such they think and believe that they know what is right and or wrong. Sometimes it is better to let them make their own decision and learn from the school of hard knocks. I was this way as a kid. When my dad told me Get back in school (I dropped out) or get a job as he wasn't raising any bums or get out of his house. Well knowing it all I joined the MARINES. What an awakening. I turned out good becasue of the Marines.(and my dad) And to this day I still thank my dad.

Why would you want to do that in the first place? You'll only end up going to work hungover, you won't be able to cencentrate, you will smell no matter what you do to try and disguise the smell and of course you will feel like S**t! The alcohol will make its way from your body through the pores of your skin throughout your day, you can try the sauna idea..might work for a little while. My best bet..don't go out when you have to work the next day, or take the day off!  Cheers!

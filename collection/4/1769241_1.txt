Dew point isn't calculated, it's measured by an instrument.  The dew point is the temperature that the air has to be cooled to in order for condensation to occur.  Either a dew point sensor (like on the ASOS sites located at airports across the country) or a psychrometer (sometimes called a sling psychrometer) measures wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperature.  The difference between the dry bulb and wet bulb temperature is the relative humidity.

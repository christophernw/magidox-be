The only way a rotating object will slow down is if there is some sort of torque acting on it to make it slow down.  Otherwise is just "coasts" freely forever.  In space there's no friction like there is on a spinning basketball for example.. . There is a small torque on the earth caused by the moon which does slow it down a tiny bit.  That's why we hear about those 'leap seconds' being added at the end of the year pretty often.. . Another way for the earth's rotation speed to change is if its shape changes.  Just like a figure skater pulling in their arms and speeding up, the earth can do the same thing on a smaller scale if an earthquake shifts some material into a new position.  But the effect is tiny because the earth is so enormous and earthquakes only move a tiny fraction of the whole mass of the earth.

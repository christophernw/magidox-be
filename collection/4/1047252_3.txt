In the United States during the 1860s there was a civil war between the technologically more advanced and industrializing North and the backward, slave-based South. It was the worst war in human history in terms of causalities. The north won and that is why the US became an industrial power. If the north hadn't won, industrialization would have taken much longer. Y'all be much 'dumber' collectively... lol

Continental Airlines normally best from the US. Transfers through Houston & Newark. Or American through Atlanta or Miami. http://www.americanexpress.com/travel normally come up trumps for cheap tickets. You can fly to either San Jose or Liberia- if you are going to Guanacaste region it works out cheaper to fly to Liberia even though the flight is a bit more. Really, you'll save yourself a lot of hassle, money & time by going dct to Liberia. I wish i did!!

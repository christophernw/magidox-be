Because there is a HUGE difference between using something as food or for medicine than using it for getting HIGH.  He scripture also tells us to be sober and vigilant.  There is nothing in scripture that says it's wrong to drink but Plenty that speak against getting drunk.  If you are using it for food, to make things you need (hemp products), or for medicine like say cateracts (pardon my spelling) then you haven't a problem.  BUT if you are using it to get High then there is a problem.   I'd tell you the same thing about say morphine If you're using it because you had surgery to kill your pain then fine... but if you're using it ONLY to get high because your a addicted then you have a problem.   . . Are you putting marijuana in the brownies for the neutrition? Or because you'll get high?  The purpose of food is to give you body fuel so it can function,  it has nothing to do with gettin high and getting the munchies.   . . There is another thing to consider ... In Romans Paul tells us to honor the laws of the land unless those laws contradict God's commandments.  We are to be righteous before all.  And the only way we are allowed to break the law of the land is if it is asking you to go against God.  For example, If you were a jew and you lived somewhere that forbade Jews to go to temple... You would have the right, according to God, to go against that law.  But if say the law said that you cannot make noise in the streets after a certian time of night then the Jews walking to temple on friday night would just have to just go quietly but could still go to temple for sabbath.   My point is... If you can still do what God commanded with out breaking the law of the land then do that unless you have no other choice.  When it comes to this command,  there are plenty of other things we can uses for food or to make products we don't need to use marijuana and we don't need to break the law.  . I hope this makes sense to you.  God bless!

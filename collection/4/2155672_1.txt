Most clubs are not All White or ALL One Race because that would be illegal... but there are clubs that other races might not want to join such as The Polish Club at the local church. It is for Polish people to get together and do Polish traditions, etc. Some of the members are married to Non-Polish spouses but they are welcome to attend. . . But there are All Women Fitness Clubs... is that sexist?

TO QUOTE FROM SCHOOLHOUS ROCK (CLICK THE LINK TO HEAR THE SONG AND IT WILL TELL YOU). . }} {Woof!  You sure gotta climb a lotta steps to get to this Capitol. }}  Building here in Washington!  But I wonder who that sad little. }}  scrap of paper is?}. . I'm just a bill,. Yes, I'm only a bill,. And I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill.. Well, it's a long, long journey. To the capital city,. It's a long, long wait. While I'm sitting in committee,. But I know I'll be a law someday.... At least I hope and pray that I will,. But today I'm still just a bill.. . }} {Gee, bill, you certainly have a lot of patience and courage!}. {Well I got *this* far.  When I started, I wasn't even a *bill* - I.  was just an idea.  Some folks back home decided they wanted a law.  passed, so they called their local congressman and he "You're right,.  there ought to be a law."  Then he sat down and wrote me out and.  introduced me to Congress, and I became a bill.  And I'll remain a.  bill until they decide to make me a law.}. . I'm just a bill,. Yes I'm only a bill,. And I got as far as Capitol Hill.. Well now I'm stuck in committee. And I sit here and wait. While a few key congressmen. Discuss and debate. Whether they should. Let me be a law.... Oh how I hope and pray that they will,. But today I am still just a bill.. . }} {Listen to those congressmen arguing!  Is all that discussion and. }}  debate about you?}. {Yes.  I'm one of the lucky ones.  Most bills never even get this far..  I hope they decide to report on me favourably, otherwise I may die.}. }} {"Die?"}. {Yeah: die in committee.  Oooh!  But it looks like I'm gonna live..  Now I go to the House of Representatives and they vote on me.}. }} {If they vote "yes", what happens?}. {Then I go to the Senate and the whole thing starts all over again.}. }} {Oh no!}. {Oh yes!}. . I'm just a bill,. Yes I'm only a bill,. And if they vote for me on Capitol Hill,. Well then I'm off to the White House. Where I'll wait in a line. With a lot of other bills. For the President to sign.. And if he signs me then I'll be a law.... Oh, how I hope and pray that he will,. But today I am still just a bill.. . }} {You mean even if the whole Congress says you should be a law, the. }}  President can still say no?}. {Yes, that's called a "veto".  If the President vetoes me, I have to.  go back to Congress, and they vote on me again, and by that time.  it's...}. }} {By that time, it's very unlikely that you'll *become* a law!  It's. }}  not easy to become a law, is it?}. . No!  But how I hope and I pray that I will,. But today I am still just a bill!. . }} {He signed you, bill!  Now you're a law!}. {Oh yes!}

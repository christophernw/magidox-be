Having turkey join the EU would help diffuse a lot of difficult situations for the EU, such as conflict with greece and the controversy over cyprus.  More importantly, it would help make the EU look more Muslim-friendly and could produce a stabilizing force in the Islamic world. Furthermore, Turkey is a very large country, population around 70 million, and could become a huge economic force that would only benefit the EU.  There are already many Turks living in Europe and it only behooves the EU to help Turkey join its ranks.

I went to my doctor and got them to write a reccomendation for a therapy pet. Maybe if she( your g-ma) sees the therapeutic part of having a pet then she would  enjoy one fo herself. But my personal and best answer would be to pray and ask God to make it happen. He doesnt need to write a note for you and he loves to answer prayers.  So get to praying girlfriend!God bless you!

I don't know if you have prefential treatment just because your grandfather was a member of the government.  I would think you would have to go through the same paperwork as everyone else.. . check out the governments website, I remember reading something about military and government workers but I don't think it pertained to family in the government,  just the applicants.. . all you can do is ask....

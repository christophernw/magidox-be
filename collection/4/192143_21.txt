Well, they certainly can't blame the drug problem on who is REALLY responsible: to name the two most prominent, CIA and the Bush family. CIA ran drugs, both heroin out of Southeast Asia during Vietnam (via an offshoot called "Air America") and cocaine out of Central and South America in the eighties. Why, after years of supporting Manuel Noriega, did they finally turn on him? Because he had a conscience attack about the drug traffic. That's just one of many examples. As for the Bushes, they are one of the biggest drug families in the country. I've read that back when George W was supposedly in the Air National Guard, him and a friend of his named James Bath spent their days unloading tons of white powder from planes inbound from places like Colombia. The Reagan-era "War On Drugs" was a sham, just like this current "War On Terror" is: subterfuges covering up the government's own involvement.. Minorities ALWAYS get blamed for the drug problem...they are easy targets, because the Honkies just assume that in their poverty, they're all boozers and druggies when, your'e right, the majority of serious drug abusers ARE white. . I mean, we'll never stop the trafficking of drugs, because it is a quintessential case of supply and demand. As long as there are people -of any colour- out there who want to turn their brains to Swiss cheese somebody will be happy to accomodate them.. Ever seen the movie "Traffic"? That is actually pretty close to the way it is.

The Bible is quite vague about thoes animals, so you could say they were there at creation and simply missed getting on the Ark.  The Bible does not give much on what animals were in the Garden of Eden, for example, other then they were there.. . There are at least two 'dinosaurs' in the Bible......The Beleomoph, and a sea serpent.. . Bri

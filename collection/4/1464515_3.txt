1st degree is when you go out to plan and then execute the murder. 2nd degree is usually as a result of something unplanned. Eg; You're in bar and get into a fight, in that sudden rage you pick up a bottle and smash it on the guy's head and he dies as a result.. . But I read somewhere, if you bring a knife on you (without planning to kill specifically just as a protection) but suddenly get involved in a fight and then use that knife and as a result kill someone, then a charge of first degree may be laid on you. The simple reason is that you should know, a knife can cause death if used. Although this is usually gets th offender off to 2nd degree in plea bargains.

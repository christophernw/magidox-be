As Penny G12 says, memories are the evidence that the past exists - the *evidence*, not the proof. In fact, *everything* I perceive, also the present (for these "memories", these visions of things which are supposed to have happened in the past, also appear in the present) may be a hallucination. Nothing and nobody can prove to me that he, she, or it exists without my mind.

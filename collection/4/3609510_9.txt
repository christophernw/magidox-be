You aren't insane but you need to control your emotions a little. Something tells me that there is something else behind your tendency to flip. Perhaps you are frustrated or angry about something but you couldn't let it out. Look deeper into yourself and ask yourself why. Try taking up lots of sports and games and learn relaxation techniques and meditation.

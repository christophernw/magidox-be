I can only add that my belief in myself to make determinations, to be discerning and have a conscience about my decisions is of primary importance. To believe in your ability to question.One thing that gives me some thought is when will humanity have the ability to realise what gives rise to the human mind.. having said that i believe you have answered your own question.. Keep asking. that's what makes us think further than the in doctrines we have forced on us as kids.. Take care my friend.. Take a look at http;//thebaldchemist.blogspot.com  Take a look at whats next.

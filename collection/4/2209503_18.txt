Your friend is only doing what she feels is right to do, once she accepted CHRIST into her life and seem all the things that GOD can do she only wanted to share this with everybody especially her best friend. If you are really her friend you would take the time to hear what she is trying to tell you. Tell me how long have you been friends, how much do you know about her past life, do you notice the change in her life, she only want the same for you, will it hurt you to listen, to give GOD a chance.

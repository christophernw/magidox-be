Imagine it this way.  At the centre of a "black hole" is a point called "singularity".  This is a point of infinite density.  The more dense something is the more gravity it has.  The gravity here is so strong it even pulls LIGHT in towards it.  Hence it appears to be a big black hole.  It is not a hole at all.. . This explanation is over simplified in the hope that it can be understood.  Strictly speaking it is probably not 100% accurate but it is near enough not to matter.. . You can not pass through a black hole.  Every atom in your being would torn from you and be crushed and ripped apart if you got anywhere near it.  . . It is created by a star imploding.  This means the star is no longer able to sustain itself and after a big explosion known as a supernova, the material that made the star collapses into itself.. . Now it is all getting a little less strictly accurate, but I think you get the point now.

well, friend..my advise to you is look at other things whenever you are presenting..for instance,when you are presenting try focusing in other objects such as the picture behind of your class, or the fan, or visualise that you are alone in the class..human mind have great powers, as you focus you can make everyone else disappear from you sight.. trust me it works..for me too..haha..good luck

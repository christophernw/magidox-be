If we open it to Canada, we will most likely have the obligation to open it to Mexico. If Bush is gonna spend $4 billion to keep illegal immigrants from Mexico, central America, and South America out (which is not gonna work, bet on it), why would he open it to Canada? We are having a population issue already. I don't think it would be fair, it would be racist against Latinos.

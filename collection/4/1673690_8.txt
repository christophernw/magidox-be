There's no real easy way because if there was then everyone would do it and even then it'd become harder with the competition. Becoming rich is a feat that's justified by the effort. (unless you mooch off of mommy and daddy). You should look into real-estate, or if you're creative become an inventor. But the richest people become that way by starting a business, so you might consider taking classes in economics.. . Also investments, futures trading, and stock market are a great way to go. If you're a savvy entrepreneur, try ebay bartering and selling. People make enough to put some bread and butter on the table and more than you could imagine doing that.

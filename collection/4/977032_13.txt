when you eat chicken what you're eating is the flesh or muscle tissue of the chicken.  this type of meat is comprised mostly of skeletal muscle and has a very organized protein structure.. . when you eat eggs you are eating a great variety of other types of proteins vitamins and minerals.  This is not to say that vitamins and minerals aren't found in chicken meat...they are, but in much different ratios.. . also, the egg's yolk has a much higher concentration of fat and cholesterol than chicken meat does.  fat tastes different than protein.

Charm quarks were first seen, and are most commonly observed, in the production of the J / psi particle, which is the lowest mass bound state of charmonium (a c/anti-c quark combination).  As with any quark, you'll never see one unbound (for reasons I won't go into here).. . If by 'seen' you mean 'observed', then the above particle was first seen in a particle chamber at SLAC and at Brookhaven - and any observation which provides information about quark composition of particles will also take place in a particle chamber of some kind, as only they are capable of tracking particle motion - and it is the specific forms of particle tracks which allow us to identify quark composition.

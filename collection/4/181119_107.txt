A good summer job is a lifeguard, a counselor at a summer program for YMCA or Boys and Girls Club.  At a big park like Sea World, Disney, Six Flags...etc.  Hmmm you've got many options.  Department store jobs are fun too.  Maybe one that carries summer clothes.  Good luck and don't forget to leave room for FUN!!!

The Einsteinian "curves space-time" answer is not an explanation so much as a model. It describes what is happening so you can accurately predict results. There is no actual explanation for why mass generates gravity, just as there is no actual explanation for why electricity generates magnetism and vice-versa. We just know it happens and we have an accurate mathematical model for it.

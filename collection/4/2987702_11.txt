I read an article in Reader's Digest that said that the fat that is between your belly button and bikini line is hereditary.  Does your mother or grandmother have the same problem?  The article that I read said that the only way you can get rid of that kind of fat is liposuction.  It is very safe these days.  I wish they had offered it when I was young.  The type of fat you are talking about can not be removed by exercise or diet.  You can reduce the size of the fat but it will never be flat and tight unless you undergo some type of cosmetic surgery.

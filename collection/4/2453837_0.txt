There is no point to racism/fascism and prejudice.  Humans who practice this are so insecure and miss so many wonderful things / people in this ole world...I think the only way to stop it is to not encourage it, not partake in its practices, and most of all not be afraid to show, speak, and pray for its demise.  I myself, try to show pity upon those who do practice prejudice and let them see how great it is to not judge our fellow human beings...race, culture, bred, etc has so much to offer to all of us!!

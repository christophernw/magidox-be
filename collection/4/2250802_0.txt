Pregnancy Diabetes, medically known as "Gestational Diabetes", is a form of diabetes that some women get when they are pregnant. It doesn't mean you will "always" have diabetes the rest of your life, but some case studies have been done stating that if you are prone to Gestational Diabetes, you may develop Type II diabetes later in your life. Just take care of yourself, watch your diet, and exercise-you should do just fine! Also, listen to your OB Dr., do everything they instruct you to do-and you and your baby will be OK!

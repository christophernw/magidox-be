Hello. . It will eat nearly anything edible to humans ... but you may need to focus on energy-rich food because as you know babies of all kinds needs a lot of energy ... like corn, wheat, barley ... whole or crushed ... and if you have some soy beans it would be great .. cause it needs protein too.... .

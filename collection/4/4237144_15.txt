"Roman paganism contributed the traditional "God bless you" or Gesundheit (May you have health) offered to one who sneezed.  The old expression was "Jupiter preserve you" or "Jupiter help me"  Its basis was the ancient Indo-European concept of the air-soul or breath-soul (Atman), which might be expelled from the body by a violent rush of air unless prevented by a verbal charm.  Covering the mouth during a yawn arose from the same fear of losing the soul.  Medieval churchmen accepted the superstition, and taught that both sneezing and yawning should be immediately protected by the sign of the cross, because "Ofttimes a man sneezed, and expired at the moment of sneezing...In like manner it often befell that man yawned, and fell dead."

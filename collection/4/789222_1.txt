Basically, the AKM is lighter than the '47 because of it's stamped, rather than milled, reciever. It has a slant muzzle brake on the end of the barrel, while the '47 does not. It's sights are graduated to 1000 meters, instead of 800 for the '47. And it has a rate of fire selector on the right side of the receiver, just above and in front of the trigger guard. It allows a shooter to select between a cyclic rate of fire of either 600 or 800 rounds per minute. The AK-47 fires only 600 rounds per minute.. . Why am I lucky, medic041282? We found more than enough weapons caches that we were able to screw around with all kinds of comblock weapons.

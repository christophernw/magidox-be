My son is a diabetic, when his blood sugar levels are normal and not running high he urinates just as much as a non-diabetic, when his blood sugars are running high he can urinate as often as every 5, 10 or 15 minutes. High blood sugars cause diabetics to drink more hence the fact they need the toilet more.  Hope this helps!

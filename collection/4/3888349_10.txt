though topamax is usually used off-label for bipolar & mood disorders, not really panic disorder (that i know of)... it's actually an anti-seizure med.  it's fairly expensive.  i'm discontinuing for that reason ($300/mo for 60qty 200mg for uninsured).  it made me see trails, doesn't ALWAYS make you lose wt (though you have a nearly zero chance of gaining), it will (esp for first cpl wks) have the effect of lowering your iq a bit (more than most psych meds)...it has the nicknames "stupamax" and "dopamax"...and if not discontinued under the careful supervision of med professional, you COULD have a seizure even if you are non-epileptic...so just be careful w/ some of these meds, k?

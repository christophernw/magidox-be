1. The college graduate, if their degree applies to the business they are entering, has knowledge of modern theories on what will work for the business. They get paid more for this knowledge and it is kind of a "reward" for doing the schooling.. 2. The college grad with no work experience can be molded. They don't have pre-established work habits coming in that may disagree with what the business owner has. There is no re-training, just training.

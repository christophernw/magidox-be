If you look at it it is only slightly round.  The Lake Victoria lakebed has not been connected to any impact, or volcanic events, rather the lake is a Tectonic Basin, much like many of the great rift valley lakes.  The basin the lake is in formed through structural upwarping of the land.  You can see eveidence for this in the uplifting around entire basin and by the fact that it is a large but fairly shallow lake.

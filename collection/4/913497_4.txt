If polishing didn't work, the next step I would go to would be a clay bar paint cleaner, like Clay Magic. The Clay bar when used correctly, even on a polished clean car, will pull dirt and debris out of the tiny pores in the paint. Do that then use a fine cutting compound on it, polish again with a buffer, and wax as needed.

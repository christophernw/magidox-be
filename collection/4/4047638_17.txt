i live outside the US, what will you think about me if i say there is no Michael Jordan in this earth?. . most of the people in the world talk about him, the news talk about him, and of course his fans around the world believe he is exist, even though most of them never meet him directly.. . so, why are people sticking to atheism? i think they are stupid, stubborn and bitter-hearted to God.

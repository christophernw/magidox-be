people are segregated for other reasons too, but the main stram thing is sexual preference...do you not remember back in the 60's? The Rosa Parks incident? because she was black?. . How about before that, when women are belittled because of thier unknown strenth?. . and both of these things still happen in today society... This sort of "segregation" thing, with gay and straights started back in the early 80's...and it still lingers.... . As more generations pass, they'll be more acceptance, but there is still racism and sexism, besides the homophobia...but it will always be at least a little of all the things i've mentioned, why? because people are just plain ignorant...

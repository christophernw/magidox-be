For many years the filters on cigarettes have been made of biodegradable materials.. I do agree that it is a filthy habit and people should get pulled over for littering and fines should be high due to the possibility of unintentionally starting a fire. . I quit smoking 7 &1/2 years ago! Now the smell makes me sick. Can't believe I used to walk around smelling like that!. . Great question,  Pandora

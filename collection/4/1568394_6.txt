Females are very aggressive and will bite any male trying to mate before she is ready.  I think you are being too protective of both of them.  She may have to bite a few times before she's ready.... . Also, if you don't alter your female before her first heat?  She is at increased risk of breast cancer.  Since she is far beyond the first heat, I don't think she's at any further risk other than what she would have gotten in the first place.

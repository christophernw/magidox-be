From Shanghai, find your way to Qingdao by train or bus and then take a ferry to Incheon. After you've arrived in Incheon, take a bus to Seoul. That's the cheapest way, I could think of.. . If you're thinking of getting there by airplane, I would recommend you to get a cheap flight from Shanghai Pudong airport to Busan, Gimhae airport and from Busan, buy the cheapest train ticket to Seoul.

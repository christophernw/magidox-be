The only appropriate way to handle this situation is to tell the Director to confront Matt personally. If there are problems between them it is not your responsability to "smooth the water" simply because Matt confided in you. You have already asked Matt not to bring you into the situation and if they contiue to put you in the middle you should speak to a supervisor as you have a right to not be put in a "hostile working environment".

You need to call your doctor.  There are many things that could cause that pain, the worst of which would be ovarian cancer.  You didn't state what sort of testing the doctor did to rule that out but you should know that young women with ovarian cancer are frequently misdiagnosed.  I don't want to scare you because it is rare, but that is the worst that could happen.

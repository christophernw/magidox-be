If you want to keep the water in the liquid form (as long as you stay below the critical temperature) it can be heated to roughly 374 degC under sufficient pressure (below critical press:218 atm) so that it does not boil.  You may keep heating and applying pressure but the material becomes a critical fluid and you will no longer be able to distinguish between the liquid and vapor phases.

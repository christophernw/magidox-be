Hey...the person I'm sure just cares for your future...you may not believe in God...but living according to the Bible is more beneficial than it is restrictive...it's just that humans wanna do whatever the heck they want. We all abide by rules...gravity...breathing...etc.. . Oh...and yes. Even if the person was "obsessed with religion"...no one should be so disrespectful so as to vulgarly insult them. No need to be rude...just say...I just don't believe...but it never hurts to just listen...hey...what've you got to lose? You have nothing to live for...right? Might as well be nice about it.

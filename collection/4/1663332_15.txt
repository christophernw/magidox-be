We muslim arent behaving like fanatic. But people tend to misunderstood us. Same like ur people (christian) there people who nailed them selves to a cross to feel like what had jesus felt (doesnt that fanatic???)... . Anyway stop being such a condemner. Learn the true of Islam then u will know. Like me myself i m educating myself to know abit about Buddhist n hindu n christian so that i know how to respect other people religion!. . Malaysian are educated to respect each others religion, n thus has made us a peaceful country. wassalam

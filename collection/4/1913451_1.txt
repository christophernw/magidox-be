The change in hair color is caused by the gradual decrease of pigmentation that occurs when melanin ceases to be produced in the hair root, and new hairs grow in without pigment.  This could be caused by malnutrition or ageing.  So far, there have been no methods devised to stop the decrease in production of melanin.

She does it because she can. Make her stop doing it. As soon as she even starts to do it, stop her. Be consistent. She will lose the habit. Pull her off of you and down to the ground while saying NO, firmly. Then let her go. Do the same thing every single time she even attempts to do it. That should stop her habit quickly.. If she tries again after some time, do the same thing. Neutering or spaying may lessen this behavior but does not stop it. Some say it happens because the dog gets excited or because it's a dominance issue. I say, I don't care WHY it happens, it's a habit I don't want and I don't allow.. Don't worry, it's a behavior you can stop.

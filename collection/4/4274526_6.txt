Legal immigrants pay income and property taxes, get valid identification, and participate in society.  They qualify to vote and take out loans and buy houses as citizens.  Their money stays here, especially tax money that supports things like welfare, roads, infrastructure, and schools.  If they came illegally originally, they have seen the error of their ways and corrected it because it's obvious they want citizenship and not just a free ride, so it's easy to forgive.. . Illegal immigrants practice identity theft, don't pay income taxes, and generally mooch off the welfare system because Mexico doesn't support its citizens with living wages or a welfare system at all.  They also usually don't spend their money here in the states, they send it back home to their families in Mexico.  So they use our tax dollars to live, spending very little of their income here, send the rest to their families, and don't contribute anything to the tax base.  It's putting a drain on our system.  If you think Medicare and Social Security are bad now, just wait until this impact has reached its full effect.  Don't even get me STARTED on property taxes and illegal kids in schools...  . . Really, I blame Vicente Fox and his predecesors for our immigration problem.  The people are trying to escape hardship because his government is corrupt and cares nothing about its people.  Haven't they done enough to their own Native Americans that now the regular citizens of their country have to suffer as well?  Despicable.... . We do need to tighten our borders to make Mexico deal with its own problems.  The illegals need to stop coming because they perpetuate crimes such as child exploitation, coyotes, identity theft, and violence.  Not that they themselves participate, but those that seek to take advantage of them do.  If they stop wanting to come coyotes can't make money or steal your SS# or sell children to pedophiles or rape and murder women.

It's interesting. Depending on the area and the circumstances, it would either greatly strenghten the family structure or be a deterant. . . For some, Poverty does add stress and pull to the family structure, thus adding to the chance that the family will break apart [divorce, incarceration, moving]. For others, and in a good percentage of cases, the lack of family structure is the reason for poverty. One parent families and their children consist of more then 50% of welfare rolls. . . In some parts of the United States, and in other countries, poverty holds families apart. Instead of breaking apart, families must rely on each other for support [both financial and emotional] and appriciate each other more.

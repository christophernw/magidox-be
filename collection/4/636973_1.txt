explain what you mean by weed out.. in the mean time i am going to assume you mean that they put people on academic probation then they have to leave if they don't get their grades up.  Well public or private colleges have a reputation.  Some schools may be a little easier to get into but  they  want to leave you there if your grades are bad.  The reason is they don't want to get a reputation of being a high school, easy school or party school.  So they have academic standards that you have to follow once you get there

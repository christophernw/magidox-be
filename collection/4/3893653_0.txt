i have a hunch that you have poor neck and shoulder posture?  stretch your neck backwards for a minute, opening your chest and then from now on force your shoulders back and down whenever standing or walking.  stick your chest out, like in the military.. . but in the short term i don't know... clean up your diet, limit sugar, eat garlic, zinc, and vitamin c, take a multivitamin with a meal, drink lots of water, get rest, take hot showers but turn the water to cold for a minute, that kind of thing. . (these people are right, though, you probably want a doctor.  hopefully the antibiotics don't screw you up too much)

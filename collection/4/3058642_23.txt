For the same reason women are Who*es if they have more than one man. While men are STUDS if they have more than one woman.    Life just isn't fair sometimes.. . To be honest with you, why in the world would any woman want to be married to more than one man?  . . NO, women don't need multiple sex partners, nor do men!!  Have you ever heard of STD's??   Get a clue!!

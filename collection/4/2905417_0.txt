Yeah, bad spelling is an epidemic that is sweeping across the vast forums of Yahoo Answer like the Bubonic Plague. It's disturbing how words are being chopped to pieces, combined with numbers and made into impossible contractions. Grammar too, the poor soul, has suffered as well, with most people outright ignoring the basic rule of placing words together in a logical manner to equal a sentence. It's a shame really.

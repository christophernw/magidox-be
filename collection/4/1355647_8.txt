I lost hair in spots above my forehead after both of my kids were born. (hormone changes) My hair dresser told me to get Nioxin shampoo, conditioner and leave in treatment.  I think it helped and it did eventually grow back. They sell it at Salons, beauty supply wholesalers, or JCPenneys salon. It's expensive, but worth it.

The writing process is a list of steps many people believe real writers go through in writing a text. In its most simple form, it has three steps: the "before writing" stage (brainstorming, prewriting, outlining), the "during writing" stage (drafing), and the "after writing" stage (rewording, reorganizing, proofreading).

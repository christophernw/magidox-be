There is always a criminal element involved with street racing, sideshows and other things.  They are racing for pinks, street cred or whatever stupid reason.. . Street racing is mostly drag racing, some canyon.  But any moron can pay someone to build a car and mash the throttle down.. . Anyone who has raced at the track knows that there are many rules and regulations, to be safe and make the odds even.  They also know how to setup the vehicle.  This is something I don't see with "night shift" racers and I laugh when they drive around corners very slowly.. . It's illegal mainly because innocent drivers and bystanders are hurt or killed when these "night shift" racers crash.. . By the way, the fastest drivers are the ones who have actually raced at the track.  The "night shift" racers would be humbled at a road course or at the staging tree.

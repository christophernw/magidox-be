Your timing is relevant because of the weather.. . Bali's weather is at its best now until say September. Phuket's weather is best Dec - March. The periods in the middle are changeable.. . Architecturally Bali is far and away the best. If you propose stopping in Bangkok on the way to Phuket then that would slightly change things.. . I like both places but they each have different strengths.. . . Regards Tony

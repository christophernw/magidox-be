I'm not sure, but I believe PTT causes pancreatitis by its molecules slowly infiltrating the pancreas. There is already a "P" molecule at one end of the pancreas, so that much of the work is already done. From there, PTT need only dispose of the "S" molecule at the other end of the pancreas, then insert its two (2) "T" elements. From there, they produce the "I" and "IS" molecules, thus creating pancreatitis.

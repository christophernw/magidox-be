Well it is weird that you need a co-signer for an apartment. If this person co-signs for you and you don't pay the rent there credit will be affected if they do not pay the rent. It works like this. for instance a telephone bill. If you pay the telephone bill nothing happens to your credit, but if you do not pay the bill your credit score is affected. I know it is bowl crap, but that is the way it works. So hope this helps you. If you have a good standing job and have been there a while and are reliable then I say they should co-sign for you. Well Good Luck

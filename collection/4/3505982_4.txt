Thats a matter of opinion. People were thought of as crazy due to the President's 'unique' personality and some of his extra-curricular activities. Look at any biographical info on him..what he did in spare time,ect. Yeah, there were unvalidated rumors, but they came from somewhere right? He also had a keen political mind, but was misunderstood often.

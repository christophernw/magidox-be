Eliminate the problem....the Human Race.. . War is caused by greed, jealousy, hatred, beliefs, etc.   .......All human traits.. . As long as their are at least two of different gender walking the earth, the seed of war is kept alive.. . Any and all attempts by Humanity to keep the peace is nothing more than another lesson in Futility.

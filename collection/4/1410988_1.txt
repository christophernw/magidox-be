I'm so sorry you saw those visual life moments.  You wrote that those visuals still vividely ''play in your mind" ?  You won't be able to erase those visuals from your mind but you can look at those events differently so your heart will relate different when those visuals return to your mind.  Try this thought...Those suicides were obviously from persons who were in very much life and heart pain (though to take one's life is not the way to go...but that's an entirely different issue).  Those persons took their life to end an emotional (sometimes physical) pain.  When those visual moments pop back in your mind visualize those persons releasing themself from the pain of their life and visualize their soul releasing lovingly into the the 'arms' of God.  Of course God will have a 'good talking to' with that person because they were not to take their own life, yet He is also a magnificantly loving God and what you saw was a person destroying their body so as to release their body to the other side and their soul is being guided on the other side.  We see buildings being torn down, dams being blown up to create new water ways, does this visual of a suicide hurt more in that you saw a precious human body being destroyed...yes...but for the distress that the visual you saw keeps coming into your mind...maybe try looking at the visual with the eyes of your soul heart.  You simply (though very uncomfortably) observed a human body, the 'shell' that 'holds' a persons soul, being destroyed...take your visual a step further and lovingly see that persons soul being released into God's 'arms'...that persons soul is being tended to on the other side. These bodies (these 'shells) are magnificant in that they 'house' our souls...to help you past this try and focus on the persons soul and visuaize them being lovingly guided and educated on the other side.  Hugs to you.

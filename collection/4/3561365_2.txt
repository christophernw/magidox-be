Technically, they have never been seen, since they are extremely small, just like top quarks, bottem quarks, anti-charm quarks, up quarks, and down quarks. As far as I know (if i'm wrong, tell me...), no atom has ever been directly imaged. Now the subatomic particles that make up an atom (neutrons, protons, electrons) are far, far smaller than an atom. So there's no way to see these. Therefore the ability to see a quark is far, far beyond current technology.

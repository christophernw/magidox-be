The best way to get back at him is to show him it DOESN'T hurt you.  When he humiliates you, just laugh and say "Oh you're getting better," or "It would have had more effect if you had said..."  Eventually, he'll get bored with your challenge, and forget about hurting you altogether.  If that doensn't work...sleep with one of his ex girlfriends ;-)

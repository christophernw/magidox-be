I have a friend who lived in Germany for last couple years and he was so ashamed of being an American. If someone asks him where he's from, he would say Canada. We Americans are generally not liked for our ignorance and biggotry. Face it, the world is a big sand box and we're the big bully. Am I ashamed of what my country is doing to the rest of the world? Yes. Many people say I'm unpatriotic because I bash this war. Well, putting a flag on your porch, a sticker on your bumper and believing everything the President tells you doesn't mean you're any better. But you know what, I'll keep playing my Xbox, eat my hamburgers, drink my Bud light and talk shiet about this country because I fcuking can.

I agree with you that war is unnessesary, but war's objective isn't to kill the other person.  War is generally used to persude another country that "my way is best." They have war rules to prevent like mass murder's and stuff like that...To prevent another Holocaust.  I believe that one war rule is not to harm cilvilians intentionally if they pose no threat.

Consulting tends to have more short-term projects that you take on and then you move onto the next project, especially in "freelance consulting" (aka unemployed).  You might help one company with a project for a few months and then move on to another company after that.. . Self-employed might mean you're doing your own thing but it's more long term and steady.  For example, you might open your own doctor's office and keep on doing the same thing for years.

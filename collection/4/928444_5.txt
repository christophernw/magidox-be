First....stop acting like he was busted smoking crack.  . Second...wait until the facts come out...Rush's side of the story is that the prescription was for him, but was labeled with his doctors' name for privacy purposes.  If you were famous and needed Viagra...would you have it filled under your name?  Probably not.  What ever happened to innocent until proven guilty?  . Third:  Rush is a radio talk show host...not an elected official (ummm...Kennedy..)  so who cares?

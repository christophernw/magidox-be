I live in NB Canada, and people here use their fog lights NON-STOP! I can't stand it! Sure, fine, use them for fog, but for goodness sakes, turn them off when there's none! They are blinding on the road coming at you! Especially when you're driving a car, and there's a lifted half-ton coming at you with their fog lights on...why not just high beam me???

In John 14:6, Jesus said, I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No man comes to the Father but by me.. . Pretty simple really.. I struggle to think how criminals of any kind could go to heaven whilst people who have led good lives wouldn't, but Jesus really is the only way.. It also says. "the vilest offender who truly believes receives an instant pardon from Jesus"

No. As you alluded to they're just muscles that are in the same area as the fat. Some people say that ab exercises can firm up the area after the surrounding fat is lost, but even the degree to which that can happen is thoroughly exaggerated. . . In fact, doing squats will technically go much farther towards a 6-pack than situps ever would. They build more muscle which increases metabolism, and low bodyfat is the key to seeing abs.

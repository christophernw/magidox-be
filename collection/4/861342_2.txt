Most pet dogs have rabies shots. If you know the dog that bit you (your dog, neighbor's dog) find out if the rabies shots are up to date. If not, you should get them yourself.  Rabies is no joke. You could die.. Infection can be pretty bad too.  A guy I knew got bit by his own cat and it got so infected his hand swelled up like a balloon--it had to be lanced (drained of pus-yuck!), he had to go on antibiotics, have his hand in a sling and bandage, the whole works.

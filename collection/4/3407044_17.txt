First you need a nuclear fission device.  Doesn't matter how many Kilotons, it's only the catalist.  Now you need about a ton of Cobolt, or Cadnium... which are nuclearly reactive.  Wrap the cobolt or cadnium around the nuclear fission device.  Doesn't matter where you set it off, the chain reaction of the fission will heat the cobolt or cadnium to a degree that it will cause nuclear fussion on a mass scale, causing the atmosphere itself to join in on the chain reaction... burning away the entire atmosphere of earth at an exponential rate...

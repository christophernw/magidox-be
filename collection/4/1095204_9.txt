Yes, it is very rare now days for people to use their turn signals, or for that matter other's to let you in if your using your turn signal. Is like they are useless now days. People do not use them because they are too lazy. And they think oh i'm going to be turning and there going to be seeing me turning anyways so what's the point of using the turn signal. . . But really we don't know when they are going to turn and we need to know when they are going to.

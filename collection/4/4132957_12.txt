It's called asymmetric warfare.  One side (Israel) has a clearly superior military.  Because of this, they choose to use their technology to minimize their own potential losses in an attack.  That usually means sending in missiles, or rockets, instead of assassins.  Explosives, even when they hit the intended target, aren't yet precise enough to only kill a single person, so there are usually unintended casualties. . . If, by your question, you're asking why Israel attacks Palestinians, the answer is simple.  They're at war.  The Muslims and the Jews have been fighting since at least A.D. 622, when Muhammad was driven out of Mecca.  Regardless of who started what, BOTH sides are shooting.

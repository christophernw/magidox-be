I think most do it out of habit or watching their family members doing it when they were young.  Or they don't want the stale smell of cigarette in their cars (funny, isn't it?).. . Many cities have littering laws and have been cracking down on cigerette butt throwers.. . I freak out when someone throws the butt out the window and sparks fly on the oil slicked highway.  I have this fear that the road catches on fire - I know this is not probable but it still freaks me out.

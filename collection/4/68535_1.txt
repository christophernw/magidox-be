Actually, it is because the major gold veins in the world are running out. Just like the natural diamond mines, the gold is becoming harder to get to & harder to find.. . Though I don't think mining has begun yet, I did hear a few months ago that a new gold vein had been found & that it was undergoing testing for purity. If the results are good, we may see prices go down a bit in the future.

My suggestion would be to clip it out with a small pair of scissors when she's very relaxed.  (Perhaps sitting on your lap, being petted would work?) Take it slow, and just try to get a little bit of it at a time.  The mat is probably pulling on her skin and hurting her, so this may be very delicate going at first.. . Once the mat is out, make sure she gets regular grooming.  Persians really do need the professional attention.

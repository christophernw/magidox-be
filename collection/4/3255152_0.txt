Priapism is when a man gets an erection that lasts an unusually long period of time and it won't go away. It also can become quite painful. It's often mentioned as a side effect to watch out for with Viagra and the other ED drugs. It is a serious condition which can leave lasting damage if not treated, and so a man should seek medical help if this should occur.

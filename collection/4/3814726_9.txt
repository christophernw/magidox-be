My favorite way to cook asparagus is grilling it on the bbq; us foil to make a little plate (fold up the sides), put butter or olive oil, garlic, lemon and salt and pepper or season all. . . Or you can saute it the same way, steam, stir fry, boil. They are all good. Make sure you snap off the ends and seasoning is always good.

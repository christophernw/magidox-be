i give all 4 of my cats baths about once every 6 months.. i stick them in the tub (it has shower doors) and scrub them down with cat shampoo and rinse them real well, then dry them with a soft towel. i usually cradle them while drying them and it helps keep em calm.  been doing this for a long time, so their pretty use to their baths now.

Write letters to the stores. Or you can go into the stores and ask to speak with the managers. Have a letter or an outline about the project ready. Also, you might try hooking up with a local church or bank or place where people in the community can drop off donations. Be specific that you want new toys, etc.. Good luck! Sounds like a great idea!

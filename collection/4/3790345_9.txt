Well, a terrorist is anyone who uses Terrorism.  Terrorism is the act of using fear or terror to get recognized or accomplish a goal.  To say that anyone wearing a Turban is a terrorist is quite racist.  I suppose anyone of us could become a terrorist even if it is to an extremely small extent.  Have you ever threatened to beat up someone if they didn't preform some certain task, to an extent that is terrorism, and most of us are guilty of it at one point in our life or another.

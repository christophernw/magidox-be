Man I feel for you buddy. Even if there is not much you can do to help out her depression, you have to at least make an effort to open up and talk to her. Try and get her to talk to a GP, they could maybe arrange a chat with somebody who could help. You have to face up to it and talk. Seek help if necessary.

Every religion most certainly does NOT think their way is the only way to heaven!! Judaism never said that only Jews go to heaven, Judaism always believed that one is judged on one's behavior, not one's faith. So, regardless of one's beliefs, your choice of how you behave will determine Gd's judgement of you when you die.

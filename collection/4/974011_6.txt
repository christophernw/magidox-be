Did both of u think about religion before falling in love??? if No.. then why are u thinking about it now??? True love needs no religion...If ur GF think her religion is more important to her then i guess she is backing out.. I have personally seen so many intercast marriages.. and both the couples having no problems with the respective religions.... because their love was strong... U need to ask some serious question to yourself and your GF.... If ur love is true no point in chickening out...

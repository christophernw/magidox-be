There is no difference between a lease and renting. The term can be month to month or whatever you want it to be. You can write anything, sign it and the lessee signs it and it is legal.. . NOW, I speak from experience. I have a Realtor's license and I managed 300 apartments for twenty five years. Here is my advice:. . You don't say how long your house has been for sale. The usual reason a home doesn't sell is it is over priced. I do not tell many people that I have a license, because I don't know any Realtor that is not thinking only of their pocket.. . I would also NOT rent out my house. There are too many problems you can encounter. There are too many problems to go into here......Lower the price and sell it...You will not be sorry and like I said, it's probably over priced anyway..

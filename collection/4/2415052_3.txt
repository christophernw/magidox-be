You can range from a random misfire.....on cylinder fires when it shouldn't........to a small pinhole in the evap system. auto zone will say well you have a code P04016......do you know what its means? I have a book that has a list of codes. anything could give you the light, with the exception of oil changes, that why you have a change oil liight in the car. We call them idiot lights. YOU WILL NOT BLOW UP YOUR ENGINE!! You'll just run like a junker

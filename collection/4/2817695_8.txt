A good strong whiskey toddy...hot, lots of lemon and honey. Of course, if you've been taking lots of medicines, probably not the best solution. . . Those Vicks inhalers work really well, and fast. They look like a little tube of chapstick, and I found mine by the cough drops at the store. They clear up congestion like a charm.

One reason is money that should be going to feed the "hungry" Americans is helping  illegals that are abusing the system and getting the free stuff. I don't agree with welfare  and feel that there needs to be a time limit placed on how long a person can use welfare and all of the social services unless, they are our elders. No SSI for brain dead drug abusers, no free education for illegal alien children... no free welfare check. if you are capable of holding a pencil, then there is a job somewhere that can be done for that check. NO running off to the casinos to try and "make" more money. I am sorry but I have seen the abuse of illegal aliens and now you will ask how do I know they were illegal. Well, I will tell you, Because they were in the jail where I worked and INS was too booked to come and pick them up to deport them, so they got released to go and get drunk an other night.. . Sorry more of a rant than your question deserved.

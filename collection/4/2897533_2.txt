Says who?. . Do you trust your skepticism or are you skeptical of what/who you trust? Are you even skeptical of your own skepticism? It baffles me that you would even think about rating one over another in terms of which is better. Both are needed in life and you need a healthy dosage of skepticism so that you are not gullible and you also need to trust in people/things so that you are not paralysed by your own skepticism. In life we have to take a certain measure of risk, so long as it is acceptable and you know the consequences of your choices.

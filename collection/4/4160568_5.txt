Its cause they think that they have no culture.  why the cheokees in particular?  becuase of the land grab in OK.  newspapers put out ads saying "is your last name, so and so, cause if it is, you may have free land in OK".  What they did not know was that alot of cherokee families (mine included) had adopted white names and the confusion started there, so Smith for example, is not a Cherokee name, but there may be cherokee fdamilies with that name, get it? OK.

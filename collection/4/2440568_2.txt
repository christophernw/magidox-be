buy tylenol for pain, take hot coffee to keep your throat warm, rub your chest with vaporrub before going to sleep, also put some on your nose, don't expose to changes in temperature, and lastly very important, keep your throat warm, use a scarf if it is cold. Also very effective for me,  Dayquill or Nightquill.

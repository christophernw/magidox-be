The first thing that comes to mind is to drive it, but I will admit from past experiences that driving a Tracker on the highway is a bit scary. The second is to hold out until your uncle fixes the truck. The third is find a friend or someone with a trailer and see if they will give your car a lift.  I know that they are a lot of people around that area that have a trailer heavy enough to haul a car. If all else fails, you may call someone like A&M Repair or someone that has a tow truck..... . Good luck...

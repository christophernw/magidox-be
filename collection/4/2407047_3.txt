Do U remember 9/11. I do and I don't like Bush. I would not vote for him ever!!!! He was fully aware of 9/11 before it ever happened. He didn't care.   Our children are over seas not to fight a war. But, to induldge Bush. After all that war could have been over in a matter of weeks if Bush wasn't holding them back..   He doesn't want to win this war because he has to much invested in the oil companys.

Depends on the situation... above answers are correct.  It can also mean creating a future financial forecast, cash flow, budget, profit/loss statement, balance sheet, etc.  Basically it's taking the financial numbers you have (client has given you) and trying to see if you can work with them (example - if you are a banker and they want a loan -- you figure out if they qualify).

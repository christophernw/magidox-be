Here's a link on the best way to chop onions. It's quick, it's easy, and you'll be able to finish chopping before you start crying.. . http://www.deliaonline.com/cookery-school/how-to/how-to-slice-and-chop-onions,65,AR.html. . Also, be sure to use a SHARP knife. It will make your life in the kitchen oh so much easier. One thing I don't like about the photos is that she's using a really small knife. Use a good chef's knife instead.

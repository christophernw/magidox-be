Cooperatives, system of economic action and business enterprise, characterized by the absence of the profit motive and involving, as its primary function, the distribution of goods and services. Traditionally, it is a movement of consumers who unite on the basis of their mutual interest in reducing living expenses and benefiting from the ownership and control of production facilities and of accommodations shared by all. Some cooperatives, however, serve the interests of people functioning as producers, not as consumers. Producers' cooperatives include associations of workers who cooperatively own and operate factories or farms. Producers also form associations for the purposes of economically purchasing supplies and of profitably marketing their produce. Such associations have been important elements of the cooperative movement in the U.S., especially among farmers. Should social changes result from the operation of consumer or producer cooperatives, they are usually regarded as by-products of an economic motivation.

When  Christians "conquered" Europe, they decided that the body was made only to procreate. Public baths which had been founded by Muslims in the South of France were closed because the Church believed that bodies were not meant to be shown to other people. Etc... It's our Christian upbringing which is responsible for it. And it is worth in America than in most part of Europe because, as someone else pointed out, America was founded by Puritans.

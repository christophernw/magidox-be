Your vet will give you "REVOLUTION". You don't need an exam for that. It will take care of the mange. You just apply it yourself to the back of the shoulders. That stuff is magic, new on the market and safe. You don't have to have a regular vet for that.Just call any of them and ask until you find the nearest one that carries it.

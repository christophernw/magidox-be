I wouldn't call allowing a man to preach hate in public and advocate, condone, and support the killing of "infidels", putting him up in a 5 bedroom house while allowing him to own a flat, paying him benefits, buying him 2 cars unsupportive at all, would you?.. . Until the Muslim Council of Great Britian take an active and public role in verbally condemning these people (which they haven't) I feel they don't deserve any support at all.. . Quite simply put, they don't deserve our support when they're leading Council have such contempt for our country and culture.

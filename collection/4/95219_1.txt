One of two things, either tell her your feelings and ask her to stop the behavior, or give her something to talk about! Next time she pops over when your man gets home tell her to "Get away from him, he's mine and I don't like you coming around sniffing him up everytime he comes to town!" or tell her to be sure she doesn't let it slip to him about the guy that was over the other day and when she looks at you like WHAT? you can say ,"You mean you didn't see him? My bad!" You know, give her a reason to be nosy!

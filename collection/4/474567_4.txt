this is true for cocktails only, look under their wings and if there are dots, (the dots are light colored like white) then it a male, if it is solid color then it is a female. The birds need to be at a mature age to know for sure, not baby chicks. For sure 100% take it to the vet, but the blood work is very expensive.. good luck!

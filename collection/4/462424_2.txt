Why are you asking us when you should really be asking your doctor. Sight is very important, and needs to be checked out asap. You may want to make an appointment with your optician too. Your eyes would not be doing this for no reason, there has to be one. Do you get headaches at all at the same time, if so it could be signs of a migraine. But you should go to your doctor so they can sort it out  for you.

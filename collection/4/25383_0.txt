at any age, babies love it. I put my son in the stroller at 2 months, It was summer time and we went in the early evening and he slept better, just make sure they dont get chilled and it is enjoyable for both of you as well as great exercise. the way they make the strollers now, they make them for as early as right after birth, so whenever you want to is the real answer.

In fact, the priests in the earlier times had to be married to prove they understand and exercise responsibility in their own family in order to be given control over a church. God created Adam and Eve and blessed their marriage, and this was, let's recall, in a perfect conditions. Should we be inclined to imperfection? No. And just check what Paul has to say about this subject in his epistles. Only if a person has the gift of abstention (the lack of sexual desire), it is ok for him/her not to get involved into relationships or get married.. And as for marrying inadequate type of women, priests-to-be must be informed on what Bible tells about characteristics of a virtuous woman. Working harder to overcome one’s (natural) sexual desire can be a waste of time and obstacle to complying one’s priestly duties and tasks. Anyway, how would you do it? Praying to God to remove it when He was the one who gave it in the first place?

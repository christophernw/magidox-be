Typically, many of the things that are "forbidden" are things that we naturally tend to desire. Sexual desires, particularly those that one's culture or religion have deemed taboo, rise from the essence of our being. Yet, most cultures and religions have a vested interest in controlling us as much as possible. The punishments for violating a taboo can be quite extreme in some countries. We all are aware that adultery can result in decapitation in some countries.. . The fact that so many of our cultural and religious taboos forbid things that we are, by nature as human beings, bound to desire is quite problematic. This alone creates much allure and attraction to the forbidden.. . There is also the issue of individual will. Many people wish to assert their individuality, their sense of self. They wish to affirm, "my will" over the oppressive imposition of "Society's will" or even "God's will". We are attracted to the forbidden as an affirmation of our own life force and our uniqueness as indviduals.. . The real question has to be then, "Why does that which brings pleasure to consenting adults need to be forbidden ever?" Where no harm is caused, it would seem the imposition of punishment upon those who find pleasure in what pleases them is itself the evil.

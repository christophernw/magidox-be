Long story short :  https://edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_user. . Two ways to delete your Yahoo Account. . (1) Get it deleted by inactivity. (2) Terminate your account manually. . For the first method, just don't login to your account for 4 months, and your account gets deleted. But the waiting period is quiet long. It is a good policy by Yahoo, as it helps maintain an accurate number of users. I remember, when Hotmail used to brag about in its initial days about its huge userbase, most of its accounts were never used by users(who had registered themselves to get a taste of what email is called). Yahoo always gave an accurate picture. Also, for common usernames like amitgupta, emmacooper, etc which are never available (due to large no of people having these names), a chance is available to the new users to get such usernames from users who are inactive( which generally have to be registered as emmacooper1232005 due to unavailability). . For the second method, I gave you the link above. The advantage is that your account is terminated instantaneously. You can read the explaination at http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/edit/edit-23.html

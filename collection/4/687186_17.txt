Before you go to bed take a minute to down 2 Tylenols and a Gravol (anti-nausea medication) with 2 Huge glasses of water.  You can't beat the tiredness without sleeping but you can wake up without the headaches and heaves.  If that doesn't work just buy a tent because for some reason when I'm camping I can wake up early the next morning ready to go again!! :o)

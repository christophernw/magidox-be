I agree with sparky39fire. The Victorians beleived that putting RIP on a gravestone it would help the spirit to be at peace and not haunt the living. They beleived that restless spirits would walk the earth forever in torment and wanted their loved ones to "rest in peace". . Also it cost to carve per letter and RIP is cheaper that Rest in Peace

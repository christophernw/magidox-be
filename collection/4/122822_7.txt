My experience is not something that I create, but rather something I seek.  It is one-on-one time in His Word, in worship, sometimes even in driving the car and praying for those inconsiderate drivers around me, ya know?  It is so awesome to see that He can turn my thoughts around in the midst of someone cutting me off or turning unsafely in front of me.  I believe it is the complete giving of yourself to a personal relationship with Jesus that starts your path of experiencing Him in a greater way.  With that, opening up to the invitation of the Holy Spirit and a prayer life that is unceasing.  I would love to read your book, please give me an update as to when you have it ready for distribution!  Blessings!

Most patients who stick it out and wear their CPAP are really glad they did.  I know it sucks at the beginning, but if you get used to it, your symptoms will be much decreased--better sleep at night, less snoring, less AM headaches.. . Take your CPAP machine with you to your next doctor's appointment, and they can make sure it fits you properly and the settings are correct.  That may help you.  . . But stick with it--you'll be glad you did! :)

According to Heidegger people, compared to things are open, which means they are not finished or done being what they should, Things instead can not be more than what they already are (dogs and rocks can be no more than dogs and rocks) Persons are humans but also protects, you can die being more than what you were at the time you were born.. So if you kill a human, you destroy that possibility.

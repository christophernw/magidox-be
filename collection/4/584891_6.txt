I really want to believe that there was an alternative reason for Snape killing Dumbledore.  It could be because Dumbledore told him to do it.  That might have been the argument being overheard by Hagrid.. . There is one part though that keeps whispering in my ear, and I can't get it to stop.  When Dumbledore says "...I make mistakes like the next man.  In fact, being - forgive me - rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger". JKR - Book 6 HBP chapter 10. . Maybe he paid for his 1 very huge mistake with his life.

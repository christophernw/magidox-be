SS is service ship, meaning government owned commercial vessels. Like when they take over ciivilian airliners to transport troops, they take over civilian ships in the merchant marine to transport tanks & such. Liberty ships were never in the navy & were not for the most part armed warships. There were armed in some cases for self defense, but still were not US Naval combat vessels.

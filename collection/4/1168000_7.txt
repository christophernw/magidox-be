on here, people probably provide the answer cuz they want their two points. plus, why not? i mean, if the person asking the question really cant figure it out for themselves... *shrug* yeah they are going to have to learn it eventually, for the test, for life, whatever. but if you can help them understand how to do it and they dont get it, idk. its good to be helpful sometimes.

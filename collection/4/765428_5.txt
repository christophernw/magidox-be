Take a yo-yo or a wieght on the end of string. . Spin the weight around like you are going to lasso something.. You will notice that the weight as you spin wants to move away from you.  Since gravity on earth pulls down and an object spinning around the earth pulls away there comes a point where the forces are equal and the object just does not move down or away but just around.

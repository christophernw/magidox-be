Researchers have tested foods to understand their antioxidant capacity. One test called Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity or ORAC for short showed that strawberries are packed with antioxidants, most notably anthocyanins, the pigment that makes strawberries red. The only problem, researchers warned, is that we don’t know if the antioxidants get into the body efficiently. . . Well, preliminary results from a study on strawberries conducted by Dr. Gene Spiller of the Sphera Foundation show that 30 minutes and 60 minutes after eating strawberries antioxidant levels in the body peak markedly. This reveals that the antioxidants in strawberries are efficiently absorbed. Once antioxidants are absorbed, they are able to fight free radicals—rogue compounds that wreak havoc on the body. . .

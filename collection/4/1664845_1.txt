They are the medical ingredients and they are cough suppressents/ expectorants.  They are suppossed to loosen secretions to make them break up so you feel the need to cough less and when you do it is more efficient.  However, many studies have show that these ingredients work no better than a placebo.  I personally like herbal tea with honey for cough and sore throat.  At night tylenol and 50mg benadryl.  The benadryl will usually lessen your cough and make you sleepy, so you can rest.

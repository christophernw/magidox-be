It is never a good thing when there is any form of fratenization at work.  I understand that you probly dont act unproffesionally at work but at the same time you and your compnay should have never put you in this situation.  . . I would take action.  Even if he is your spouse that ten times worse.  Covering for a co-worker is bad enough.  Definately if your in Finance or Banking.  You situation can easily be mistaken for a conspiracy.  Your lower staff knows so its only time before your upper management knows.  Show some integrity and ask your husband to do the same.  Your job is your job and honestly if it was some one else..... Tell me you wouldnt have taken more action??????

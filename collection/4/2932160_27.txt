well first of all try to pay attention to the class you're having trouble with so that way you already know what you're going to search for when you're home. do not try to do you're home work until you had a good rest of all day school,in this period try eating you're favorite fruit and through that time think every thing that's most important to you and accomplish it therefore you'll have nothing else to daydream about ,if that does not work you must be thinking of a girl.. another thing exercise is priority to.good luck buddy. from ;hikury01@yahoo.com

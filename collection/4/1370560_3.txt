This myth of death and Mummys curses is a falsehood, which Hollywood and Writers have perpetuated for entertainment. 'The Mummys Curse' was written circa 1830, and first brought about the idea of Egyptian curses, though as the Jews plundered (though, in the Bible they use the term 'borrowed') the graves around 750BC and haven't faired too badly, it can be dismissed.. As another answerer has already hinted, the King Tut Curse is probably the most famous, yet this too is a myth. Howard Carter died over 10 years after entering the tomb, Lord Caernarfon (who funded the excavation) died of blood poisoning, and in fact the final member of the group to die, lives to the age of 93, and only died in the 1970s.. Great fun, all these Scarab Beetles running around, Osiris laying claim to souls, etc. but pure fantasy.

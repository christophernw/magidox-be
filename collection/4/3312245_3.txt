if you have had a heart attack your goal LDL goal is <100, if it said "LDL calc" then they atually didn't check your true LDL level.  they used a formula to estimate it.  good LDL is <130, they won't put you on medicine for it until it is <160 usually, unless you have other risk factors or disease states.  call your doctor to learn more.  by the way, HDL is good cholesterol, you want it as high as possible, >40 for men, >50 for women is the goal.

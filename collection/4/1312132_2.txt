Concern is a better answer. Not only the church but also christians should be concerned because the book has not only misrepresented the church as a murderous institution and that christian faith is utterly false. . . "Brown writes about this mysterious and holy reality as if it were the Kiwanis Club with a somewhat longer and much nastier pedigree. Given how Catholics understand the Church, it was inevitable that his painfully false portrayal - despite its being fiction - would to be taken personally, for in a very profound way, it is personal.. . By way of analogy, imagine what your reaction would be if a novelist were to tell you, "I am going to write a novel about your family, in which you will be portrayed as a band of criminals and perverts. I am going to use your real name and the names of your parents and grandparents. All the information regarding your family - a fair bit of which will, in fact, be true - will be presented as if it were the product of careful historical research. But - not to worry - it's only a novel, and afterwards I'll give you a chance to respond to the falsehoods in my book.". . Of course, our imaginary author has every right to publish his novel. The question to be raised here is another: would anyone with a sense of decency or responsibility write such a novel and then - when the novel is an international success that is taken far too seriously by many readers - make a movie of it? I find it hard to believe that this is the kind of thing that Sony and Dan Brown are eager to be seen doing." -Fr. John Wauck

Any time a black or Spanish person does not get their way, they cry racism.  Am I a racist for saying that since we all are created equal, we all should pay our own way?  Keep in mind that when I say that, I mean everyone, blacks in the ghettos and white trailer trash too.  Am I a racist for saying that since Germans, Italians, French, Hungarians, Russians, and any other non-Spanish speaking group of people can and do learn English when they come to the US, I think Spanish people should learn it also?  Now, if I said they are too stupid to learn the language, and that is why we have to cater to them, that would make me a racist.  But I assume they are equally intelligent.  Does that make me a racist?

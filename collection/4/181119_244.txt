Ok ...alot of ppl have answered your question and my answer is the same...an . Amusement Park you get to ride the rides for free and eat for free and still get paid to have fun and watch the excitement..especially one the large rides for adults that are scary just to see their faces...Trust me So Much Fun to see Adults scared out of their socks and hear them screaming, then laughing afterwards...so go ahead and try it..... something you can share with your friends at home.:)

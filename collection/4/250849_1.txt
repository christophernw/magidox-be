the body adapts to what you eat.. if you eat meat the body adapts to burn fats and protein for energy. if you eat grains the body adapts to use carbohydrates, starch and sugars.. if you eat them together or alternate them frequently, the body doesn't use one of them and instead stores it as fat.. . it takes a few days for the body to adjust to a new diet.. . if you want to build muscle then you must eat protiens,. also you must exercise to the point that it hurts.. the pain tells you that the muscles are tearing from usage. the body will automatically repair the muscles. the repaired muscles will be thicker this makes them harder to damage the next time. ie. you'll need heavier wieghts.

Well, . . Its another loan usually at a lower interest rate so that you pay off other loans...The company you borrow from actually sends the money to the accounts you are in debt to. There fore in theory you have only one payment to make.... . the problem there is that if you default on even one payment they will jack the rate up to 19% if you are lucky.. . As for what the poster above said about the smaller payment? Well, you actually pay a larger payment in the end. You always do.

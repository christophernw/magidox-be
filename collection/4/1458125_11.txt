A woman asked confucious, "When should I start training my child?"  The question was answered with a question, "How old is your child?" and her answer was "five years." Confucious almost paniced: "Woman, hurry home, you are five years late!"  Old addage, as the twig is bent, so grows the tree.  As a past foster parent of 16, I know the importance of constructive instruction from the genesis.  No 'beatings' with rods, but INSTRUCTION as does an orchestra conductor with his 'rod.' An intelligent child will know how to handle "peer pressure" as a duck does water from rain. John Schoonover, knightsindirtyarmour@yahoo.com

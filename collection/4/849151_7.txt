Using the Newton's First Law of Motion: . Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it. Inertia.. . So in this case, the ball is at rest and will want to stay at rest unless there is a external force acting on the ball. The friction between the surface of the ball and the floor of the wagon is very small. Thus the force acting on the ball due to the friction of the floor is negligible to cause the ball the roll towards the direction of the force.

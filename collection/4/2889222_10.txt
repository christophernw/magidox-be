never hit or physically "punish" any animal. anyone who does this thinks this is the only way to communicate. pulling the tail or sticking your finger in their ear hurts them and makes them either more aggressive, anti-social or fearful! with a cat, a spray bottle of water is a deterrent for most unwanted behvior. also a firm "no" or "ah-ah" when he goes for you hand will help. consistency and patience will do it.

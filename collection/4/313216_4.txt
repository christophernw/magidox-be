People probably piss you off due to a lack of patience or willingness to tolerate other people.  I would state that you are probably in your early 20's and still think that you more than likely are in the right at all times. Fortunately you will learn as you get older that you are not, and you will begin to empathize more with others and have patience for ideals, morals, and philosophies that different from your own. . . Why cows don't fly?  Probably because of one of two reasons. 1) God didn't make them that way 2)Evolution found it useless for them to fly.

Do you mean the 39 steps? If so it is a movie by Alfred Hitchcock. As regards the 49 steps there are various possibilities including instructions in the art of Wudang Taichi sword or a Jewish guide to awakening or even how to make a rose out of paper, to name but three. Can you give any more information about the possible subject matter??

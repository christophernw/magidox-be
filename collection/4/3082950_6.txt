One mile is not that bad, even though it was horrible for me to run through the whole thing for the first time. I highly reccomend a gradual process, increasing your enurance a little eah day. For example, the track I use to run was 12 laps for a mile. I would knock out 6 or 7 before Im exausted, then I would try to run an extra lap untill I made it to 12. I also reccomend that you run with music, keeps your concentration off the exaustion. It also helped me when I ran with a friend, because it created a type of competition, and you'll get a motivation to win.

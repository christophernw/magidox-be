Misplaced envy. I say misplaced because I know of few nations or cultures that don't deserve to feel pride in who they are and where they come from. But all nations have one of two things, resources or a stable government. Most of Europe have stable governments but few resources. Most of African, on the other hand, have lots of resources but corrupt governments. The US alone has both. That puts us in a very enviable position, since we are able to more fully utilize our resources. But Japan competes with us vigorously, in spite of her lack of resources. So does Europe, on occasion, but more often than not, they choose to whine about us. Europe should learn from Japan (and North Korea). . Third world nations have rulers who horde or waste the resource and deprive their people of a future. The solution has always been to somehow blame America for the problem rather than acknowledging that greedy despots make for oppressed people. . . One basic rule of reality is that it's not always bad when something good happens to someone else. That concept seems lost on much of the world.

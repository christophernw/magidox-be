"Truckers" are the major goods transport of this country. Trucks move more goods from coast to coast and border to border than any other form of transport. (some correct me if I am wrong) At restaurants(usually at truck stops) they rest and converse with outer fellow truckers.they are required to spend a certain amount of time not driving.

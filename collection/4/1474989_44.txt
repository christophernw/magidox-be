I'm sorry about how you feel about your friend,... about this question you have, you'll have quiet lot of different answers from every one who believes in God but I encourage you to take your time one day and ask God the same question you are asking everyone. He has the perfect answer for all your questions, and don't feel bad for your friend, She is at peace with God, you should be asking yourself that when your time comes, what are the things that pleases God that you would have done for Him. Remember, you are here for a purpose. Are you doing things for the love of God or you doing things for the world? God bless you my friend, search Him while He still can be found- don't delay

Their is no answer to your question. These atheists have a right to believe anything they want. With no proof it just makes them  look  wrong. They have no morals or principals to guide their life. . Let them dig themselves into their pits of despair. In the past I have met those that don't believe inGod and have turned out to be horrible people. They don't care about anyone but themselves and even that isnt always the case. However, Atheists have every right to believe what they want without proof,.... some might say christians do the same... no real proof of god but they believe non the less.

The government realise that when you have the knowledge to make moneym why don't they take it all away from you before you are wise enough to actually realise what they are doing!. . I think its wise to not go uni and allow getting into all of that debt and get some work exp and then start from there.. . Me, however, i am going to university to study Architecture to become an architect. I would need a degree by law to practice as an architect, so its a bit different for me you see.

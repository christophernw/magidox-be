If you wash, comb, and bath your dog on a regular basis and apply a good flea repellent after bathing you can keep most fleas and/or ticks away.. Also adding garlic to their food helps a lot in keeping fleas away.. The best repellent currently out there is "Advantix" or "Frontline" that you apply on the skin along the backbone.

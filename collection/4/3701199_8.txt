Its garbage as long as you also believe that you are OK in the eye of your "higher power" However many religions say the exact opposite, that we are NOT "OK".  That we need to do something to be OK. . . However this is also one of the main points that separates Christianity from other religions.  Scripture shows that there isn't anything we can do ourselves that ultimately makes us OK with God.  This is seen in both the OT and NT scriptures.  While sacrifice was necessary in both cases(the priestly ones OT, Christ's ultimate priestly one NT)  ultimately the only thing that makes us OK in God's sight is simply his grace and and our faith in it.

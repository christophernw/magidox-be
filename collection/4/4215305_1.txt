extra virgin olive oil isn't suitable for friying because it has a strong destinctice taste that is more for flavor than texture. as for health, "EVO oil" is probablythe healthiest you can get.  As long as you eat some healthy foods with your fried foods and keep everything in balance, you should be fine.  as for th difference between the olive oils, Extra Virgin olive oil is what comes from the olives the first time they are run through the press it is the best quality, the most colorful, and has the most flavor (making it unsuitabl for frying!)  Virgin is the second time through the press, and regular is the most bland, the least colorful, and the cheapest because it is the last times through the press.

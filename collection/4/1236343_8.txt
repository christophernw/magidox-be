Non-religious people can be "spiritual". Not following an organised religion does not automatically make one irreverent or unappreciative of spirituality. "Spiritual" is a way of life, and spirituality is much, much too broad to be encapsulated by the word "religious". They are not synonymous. Not by a long way. That's why this place is named "Religion & Spirituality", and not simply "Religion".. . Non-religious people ask questions here because they are curious to know what others feel about religious and spiritual matters. They want to broaden their own knowledge and test the knowledge of others. Have you ever considered that it is out of respect that we seek to understand your viewpoint, instead of mindlessly ignoring/attacking it? Sure, some people here are close-minded enough for this not to be the case. But most questions I've encountered here from non-religious people reflect a genuine desire to know, and comprehend the thought process of religious people like yourself.. . How can you say we are "empty inside"? Have you ever been non-religious or atheistic? Every person I know, who fits this description, has an incredibly profound sense of self and spiritual awareness. They are lovers of life, and see beauty in all things. Before you accuse us of being judgemental here, I urge you to reflect on your own rash judgement of us.

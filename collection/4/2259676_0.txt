I'm in Hampton Roads, VA and we're having one of those gorgeous Spring thunderstorms.  My apartment complex is real junk so none of the gutters work very well and water is overflowing and shooting everywhere.  Of course all the trees are a really nice soft green color, I think because we had a unfortunately mild Winter.  It's so dark, but the lightning is hard to see through all this rain; however, there's some really excellent thunder.

I'd need more info to answer... But i figure it is not an ipod because it has an usb port. So if it has screws it can be fixed, you just open it pull out the broken piece and replace it with the usb port of an old pen drive you no longer like. If it sounds too complicated take it to your nearest computer repair shop, they know how to do that.

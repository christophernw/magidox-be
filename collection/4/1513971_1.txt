It depends on the call. Public intoxication is a midemeanor and if the Officers are busy they will abate it (let him go if someone else is there to take the person home etc). In some localities the Police force is short handed and officers will try to focus on more serious crime (Rape, Armed robberym Murder etc) so some folks can catch a break. Really, they are supposed to arrest of course but officers use their discretion a lot.

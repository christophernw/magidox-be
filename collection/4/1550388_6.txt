This is a very complex question.  You need to start with the history of Anti-Semitism in Germany and Europe before Hitler.. . You need to study the history of German philosophers and anti-semitism as well.. . Then you need to study politics and propaganda.. . As far as mexicans and puerto ricans (I guess) there really are none in Germany.  For this you need to look at a map to understand.

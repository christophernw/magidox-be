Try a drop or two of mineral oil. Put the drops of mineral oil in your own clean hand and rub your clean hands together. Then rub your hands all over the cat. Use mineral oil,USP, found in the pharmacy in the digestive aid area. Cats lick, so that is why it has to be safe to ingest. Somebody in the pharmacy area should be able to help you find it. Good luck.

The Cold War is generally believe to have begun around 1946 in the aftermath of the Second World War and ended in 1991 with the dissolution of the former Soviet Union.. . The origins of the Cold War lie in the power vacuum that was created with the defeat of Germany in World War II and the decline of Great Britain and France as world powers due to the economic and military costs of the war. That left the Soviet Union and United States as the only two major powers and they came into conflict in terms of the terms of a post war peace settlement. Both sides also had different objectives - the Soviet Union of increasing it's security with a buffer zone of satellite states in Eastern Europe and the US with creating the basis of a long lasting peace and spreading democracy.

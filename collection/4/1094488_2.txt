They have a certain amount of momentum which slows their descent, but they are actually falling all the time. They are just falling around in circles, like a marble if you drop it into a funnel. The forward progress of the marble keeps it travelling laterally, but the travel downwards keeps its speed high enough to keep it travelling laterally. Eventually it will fall, but not before tracing out large circles around the edge of the funnel. Gravity is comparable to that.. . Good Luck!

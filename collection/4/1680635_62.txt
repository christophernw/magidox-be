Personally, I like eating something light before I get into the heavy and/or rich food. It gives your tastebuds time to get working, and (in the long run) it's easier on my stomach. Others felt the same way as I do, and thus the appetizer was born. Each culture has their own favorite appetizer (Tex-Mex has chips and salsa, for example), but the one of choice for most Western European food was the easy-to-make salad. And there you have it!

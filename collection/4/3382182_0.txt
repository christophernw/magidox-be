Males are usually easier to train than females for women, but your dogs (regardless of their sex) have to see you as the aplha, aka leader of the pack, since dogs are pack animals they look for a leader, and if there isn't one then a dog will try to become the alpha.  Every dog is different and some dogs are natural alpha dogs, others are just content to be part of any pack, so it may be that you have a male who is naturally driven to be a leader and a female who just wants to be loved.  Try to find a reputable training school where they can help with different techniques for different dogs (if they are teaching the same thing for every dog then find a different plkace).  Dogs are just like raising kids, what works for one child does not necessarily work for the other, but the more time you spend working with the dogs, the more you will know how to make the dogs and you happy!

In some cases, I think this is a regional thing. In NJ, where I grew up, everybody used to bag their own groceries. In Ohio, we never do. On the other hand, while traveling in NJ last summer, I got out of the car at a gas station, without paying any attention to the sign on the pump. This guy came running out to pump my gas. I'm not even sure where you'd find a "full-service" pump in NEOhio anymore!

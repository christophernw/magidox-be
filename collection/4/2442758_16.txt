They aren't totally the same. They did start from the same place though. Catholics pray to Mary as well as Jesus & God. Christians don't pray to Mary. Also a Catholic priest isn't suppose to ever marry, where as a Christian preacher can marry. They have a few other differences too, but I don't remember them all.

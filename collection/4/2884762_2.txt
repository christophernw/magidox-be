We're not frightened, just intimidated.  We're used to having to impress women with high-powered jobs, flashy cars, and the like.  The intelligent woman can see right through all that flash.. . We're also bothered by the possibility of appearing stupid.  No man wants to be one-upped by another man, much less by his own date.. . Finally, it could be the men you associate with.  Maybe you should look elswhere.  Good luck in your search.

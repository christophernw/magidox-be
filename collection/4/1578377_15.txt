Very easy, once you've realized what actually needs to be done it'll become your favorite bit in fractions:. . if you've got 2/3 .                    ------.                     5/9, . what you have to do is take the bottom fraction, and turn it upside down, and * multiply* by the top fraction.. So in this case the bottom fraction is 5/9, . you turn it upside down, that's 9/5. you *multiply* with the top fraction, i.e 2/3*9/5  = 2*9/ 3*5 = 18/15. and then you reduce it like you always do, in this case to: 6/5

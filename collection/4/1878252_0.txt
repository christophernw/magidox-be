read the preamble to the constitution. It gives a clear detail of what bad Governance is and what the american people can do about it. Seccession is mentioned. If you look in american history you see certain people have been trying to correct this along time. the civil war was the second fight for american independence. If you continue to read the constitution you will see that taxes are illegal and the whole government is corrupt not just the republicans. we need to be united and strong and vote in people who will be for us not against us. someone with thoughts about the future of our children and for all humanity not just their own personal gains. I am a free american and will stand for the flag and the constitution for all time.

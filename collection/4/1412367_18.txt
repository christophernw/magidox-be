It's very simple.  He knew that in order to get elected President you had to have a certain number of Electoral College votes, like we've all known since the day that system was developed.  And so he went to the people of the United States and told them what he thought and what he'd do as President, and enough people agreed with him, twice, that he won more than the necessary number of electoral college votes to become President.  You must be very young in order not to know that.  I hope you learn, in the very near future, the simplicity of it all.  Remember, the next election is only two years away, and it's so very simple to get yourself registered to vote and then do so.  And that's such a simple process, that even, as the tv commercial says, "It's so simple even a caveman can do it."  Good luck, and God Bless you.

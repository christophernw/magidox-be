Cats and dogs actually perform this little ritual because of evolution. Millions of years ago, the animals of that time would circle the floor they were about to lay on in order to soften the dirt, as to make it more comfortable when they are resting.. . Millions of years later, a lot of animals do this mostly because it's programmed into their brain, but not for any specific reason.. . I researched this question a long time ago because I have both cats and dogs and they strike me as odd creatures a lot of the time!

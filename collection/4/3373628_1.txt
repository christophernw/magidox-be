Canadains sometimes pronounce certain "a" vowels differently. For instance, in the words "pasta" and "drama" they pronounce the first "a" as an American would pronounce "a" in the word "at". Also, they call Macaroni and Cheese "KD" which is short for Kraft Dinner, but that doesn't have anything to do with their accent I suppose.

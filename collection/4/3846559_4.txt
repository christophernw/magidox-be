Studies show 72% of people feel asleep faster and had pleasant dreams after eating cheese just before bed.. . Studies also show you sleep better if you stick to a routine before bed. Try doing the same things every night in the same order, and, if possible, at the same times.. . Listening to soft, quiet music with little to no drum or base in it helps some people, as well.. . Oh, studies also show smelling vanilla helps people sleep better.. . Hope it helps. ;)

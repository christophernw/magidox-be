I will recommended a walk in the Central Park and in the Fifth Ave., The Empire State Bldg.and Brian Park. The following museums: Metropolitan, Guggenheim, Natural History with the Planetarium,  The Soho, Greenwich Village and Rockefeller Center. I personally don't like to go to site of the World Trade Center and China Town. If you have Kids don't miss the American Girl store and The Toys Are Us at Time Square. There are plenty of restaurants. I also recommended a trip in the Subway is essential part of the City. I love New York.

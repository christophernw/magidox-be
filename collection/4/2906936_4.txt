Well obvisiously you are too ignorant.  You shouldn't even be alowed to own animals.  Anyone who can mistreat them is cruel.  It's one thing to do it to yourself.  You have the choice.  Does the dog choose to do it?  I seriously doubt it.  Stop mistreating your dog before he/she could have serious health problems from it.

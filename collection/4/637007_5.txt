don't you remember the story about the old man and his grandson. he made the grandson a great jacket of a marvellous fabric, but the grandson tore it. He then made the son a tie of the fabric, but the grandson tore that as well. Finally, he made the grandson a button from the last of the fabric, but the grandson lost it. The grandson cried at his grandfather, "make me something else with this marvellous fabric," but the grandfather simply stated "You can't make something out of nothing."

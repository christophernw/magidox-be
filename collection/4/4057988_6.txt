I don't believe they do - they're just more comfortable with each other because of familiarity.  If different races spent more time mixing together and accepting and respecting each other for who they are, then "separation" would eventually fade.  We would begin to adopt various cultural habits, activities, etc. from each other.  It would be enriching for any culture to do this.  -Peace

i really don't know but i can tell you this which is abit wierd....i used to work in a day centre with mentally and physically handicapped people. and this lady that had autism she would only say a few words. but when she counted she would count to twenty and miss out the number 13 i asked her mum why and she told me as it was evil and it was unlucky too. and yes it freaked me out even more than usual......hahahahaha

Hiccups are caused by a baby's immature muscles and occur quite often in some babies. There is nothing you can do when your baby gets the hiccups except to let them run their course and understand that they are normal and no cause for alarm. If hiccups last for a long period of time and interfere with feedings, however, check with your babyâ€™s doctor.

Although it is weird to keep chocolate in your pocket, why don't you try wrapping it up in some plastic wrap or tinfoil, tinfoil usualy works because it helps keep the chocolate cool,I wouldn't even suggest putting it in your pocket though, because most likey it'll melt no matter what you try, you could also try to eat it before you put it in your pocket lol

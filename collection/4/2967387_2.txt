Giving person traits to non-persons...eg.  Saying the sky was crying tears, or having animals in literature behave as humans do (though that specifically is referred to as anthropomorphism). Saying your computer is in a bad mood, your pen lept off the page, your keys got up and walked away.. . In essence...giving human traits to nonhumans.

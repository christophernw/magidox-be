As a technical matter, the reason dogs bark is because people bred them to. None of the ancestors of dogs bark - wolves, for example, which are the wild animals that people domesticated to become dogs, do not bark. Dogs were gradually selected for making noise - vocalizing is more human, so dogs that did it would tend to be the dogs people liked and bred. As dogs started to make noises, the ones that made noises at intruders were valuable as a sort of ancient burglar alarm. The trait of barking gradually became part of the modern dog over several thousand years for these reasons.

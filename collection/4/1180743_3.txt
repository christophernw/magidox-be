I am finally, FINALLY, debt free.  It is the most teriffically, awesome feeling!  . . We sold our house last year & paid off all of our cards with some of the money left over after we bought the new house.  I called & cancelled every last one of them.  Melted them in the fireplace.. . I had been through a bankruptcy 6 years ago, and was headed down that same road again.  The problem was that I was not making enough money to make my house payment, utility bills, and still buy gas & groceries.  So the gas & groceries were going on the Visa.. . I now have a new, better paying job, no mortgage, and best of all-no credit cards!  Woo Hoo!

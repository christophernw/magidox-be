Although not one of the best beaches in Australia in terms of surf (in fact very poor on the surf front, mainly due to being located on the north-eastern shore of Port Phillip Bay), it does have many colourful "boxes" that are used by families to store everything you could want at the beach. From beach furniture to towels, bar fridges, eskies, boogie boards and warm clothes. (It is melbourne after all, it gets pretty cold) Brighton as a suburb is quite well-to-do, and boasts some of Melbournes prettiest and most expensive homes. The beach boxes themselves are expensive to buy due to the limited number and the fact that they are infrequently sold, instead tending to remain within families for a long time.

Hello, I have a theory. Maybe those particular car owners are simply so busy paying for those cars that they don't have time to take care of them. Or, we could just blame the government and say what I've been thinking for a long time. The U.S. government should require a national auto test annually, just like in other countries. I've done some traveling, and I've noticed that you don't really see a lot of crap cars in places like Ireland and China. So, basically what I am saying is that people are too busy, and our governments crap. :)

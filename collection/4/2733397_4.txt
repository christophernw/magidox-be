Well to start let me know what the source of income for the Iraqi government is......ooohhhhhh thats right its oil and not much else so to quickly defeat and then fix their government they will still need a source of income (oil) so instead of cryin about us protecting a valuable resource do some thinking and try to understand why.  In regards to not confiscating the weapons we didnt do that for a very good reason.  Guns are a very important part of their culture and when you come in and cause cultural problems you would see even more problems then you would now.  So no the people that run this country are not idiots contrary to popular belief they are doing what they thought best.....last time i checked most people thought we would be in and out and we should disrupt their lives as little as possible.....kinda what you have to do when you are trying to win the hearts and minds of others.

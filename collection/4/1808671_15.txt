a hangover is simply dehydration. if you can,, try to drink a glass of water with every drink,,,since no one does this,,,,at least try to drink a lot before you go to bed,,,the more you drink,,the less you hurt,,,,,but once you have a hangover,,the only cure ,,is 24 hours,,,,,and hey ther,,,Boriquany or whatever your name is,,,,,take a valium dude,,,,you seem reaaly wound up !

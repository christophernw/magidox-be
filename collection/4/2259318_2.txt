All hair cells are dead - colour not important. They grow because new cells are always being produced in the hair's root, which pushes the old cells further out.. . If hair cells weren't dead it would hurt when you cut your hair! (okay, technically that's not true but it's the explanation that convinced me when I was a kid).

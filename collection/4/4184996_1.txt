. Yahoo's new technology, has  a glitch ... banning IDs. ... this doesn't mean you violated TOS. Many are getting chat bans for no reason. If you got booted / disconnected ... then can't loggin click this link to learn more and tell yahoo > http://www.freecreed.com/userid.html ... . . Perhaps if enough people tell Yahoo and they get enough complaints....they will do something about it. ( keep in mind yahoo work on a VERY delayed response). . But if you have done any of the below expect to be banned. Yahoo has changed the "goalposts" to try and stop the sex bots / scrollers / booters / abusers / cheats...If you scroll ...or..send multiple invites...jump lounges or tables ..click kibitz multiple times...you will be BANNED....Yahoo thinks you are up2 mischief doing these things..... If you run a booter ..spamm..... violate the law ... cuss or abuse chatters among other things ... and Yahoo recieves an abuse report ... and recieves a copy screen shot of the past chat session , Yahoo has the USA courts legal permission to deactivated or ban accounts.. . Use another ID till your bann has finished

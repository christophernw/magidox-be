I would quit and file a complaint with the Human Rights Commission.  Get all the details down and go see a lawyer.  If they owe you any money, go to Labour Standards.  It might also help to go to see an Employment counsellor and ask for some advice about your situation and what you inadvertently might have done wrong.  Make sure you don't have communication or behavioural problems.. . Do not work for people who dislike you, are ridiculously demanding and make vague complaints about your attitude.  If I complain to someone or about someone, I do the following:. . ! write down two examples of the behaviour along with dates and times.  If I am not able to do this, I write my general impression and list at least two specific displays of behaviour and attitude problems.  I give my feelings on the matter and not the person.  I separate my feelings about them from the issue.  I say why it bothers me and what I want from them in terms of improvement, temperament and behaviour.  Attitude is a useless word.  Talk about moods, actions, comments, temperaments, impressions, anything but attitude.

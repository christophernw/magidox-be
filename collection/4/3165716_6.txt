First, check the brakes while the vehicle is parked. If they are spongy, you may need to take a look at them before driving. If your driving do the following:. . If it is the front brake lines, use the emergency/parking brake. They utilize the rear breaks. It will be a longer, slower stop compaired to the regular brakes because of loss of brake pressure.. . If it is the rear brake lines, use the main breaks to stop. They will feel spongy due to loss of brake pressure and will be a longer, slower stop.. . If you have complete failure on all brakes, lift the foot off the accelerator and head for the shoulder of the road or an open, un-obstructed area (grass median or shoulder). This is to slow down as much as possible before stopping. To further slow the car down, move the car in a slight 'zig-zag' motion to create more friction on the tires and the road.. .

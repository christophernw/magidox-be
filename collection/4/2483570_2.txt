The answer is the same for all institutions, industries, companies and that is to refine, enhance and innovate new processes, products ("weapons") to improve your game.  In the military's case that is by developing new weapons that replace older more expensive and most likely more dangerous to the solidier using it (not necessarily to those receiving it).. . We are America we don't lose in the war games we got the best toys and hence the best toy makers (plus the Israelis help us a lot).

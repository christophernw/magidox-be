If it's a male cat, get him fixed if he's not already.  Get it checked for a urinary tract infection.  Cats with this often time pee on the floor (my female cat did it).  If medical is ruled out you can buy special plugins that are supposed to stop this behaviour.  I personally never tried it.  Also some cat foods seem to make it worse - I stopped feeding mine Meow Mix because it seemed to make him do it more.  Problem is, once they do it once it's hard to make them stop as they can smell it no matter how hard you clean it.  I tried using special "odor removers" - they don't work.

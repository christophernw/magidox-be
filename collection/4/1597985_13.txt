Well I don't know what state you live in. I live in Texas so your question is a little wierd to me considering we have a death row express lane. But if you do some research and compare states with a death penalty to states without one, you'll find that the states that do not excecute people  have lower murder rates than the states that do excecute people. The death penalty does not deter crime because you either 1. commit a crime in the heat of the moment when you are not thinking about the consequences, or 2. you are a professional criminal and make your living off of it in which case you have accepted the consequences and don't care. . . But here's what I finally used to determine whether the death penalty was right or not: If I was faced with life in prison, I would try everything I possibly could to kill myself. Enough said.

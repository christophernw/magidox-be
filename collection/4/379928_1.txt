You have broken piston rings, or a hole in the top of a piston. If you have blow by, the rings are shot. But I would lean toward the first statement. Run a compression check on all cylinders. If below 100 psi, your engine is shot, done for . A good reading 160+psi per cylinder.. An engine with fuel in the crankcase, can blow up. One cup of vaporized gas is equal to 3 sticks of Dynamite. Could be someone put it there?

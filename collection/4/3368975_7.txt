Catholic is a Greek-derived word which means "universal." It is not a separate religion from Christianity. It is an original form of Christianity, preserving, along with the East Orthodox, the worship and piety practices of Christians from earlier times.. . We do not worship Mary, statues, or the Pope. We ARE sacramental, traditional, and liturgical, however.

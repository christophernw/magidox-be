to make the story short... Catholics don't have to ... they go to a priest if they want to. No body make Catholics, do anything. the priest doesn't give any punishment.  I guess you don't believe in religion or at least Catholics. Just think what could have happend if were not for the Catholics. I may remind you that most of occidental laws are based on roman law and make some research and compare roman law with roman church.  I am sure you will ask for fogiveness when you needed it. don't worry you will not have any problem  if you are truly sorry. Even though you don't need a priest you may seek counsel or guiadance from them. Being a priest doesn't make you a perferct person. So if you have a problem because one made you wrong or something like that... you know what i mean... well i hope this help you.

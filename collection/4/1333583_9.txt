a good brand of feed, that has the nutrients that the horse needs--there are feeds made for young horses, old ones, those who can not eat hay due to allergies, etc. You can find the specific grain that will suit your own horse. Most people feed a timothy hay or mixture , some feed a timothy and alfalfa hay mix, which is what I fed to mine. In other areas, they may feed costal hay and oats, it also depends on where you live and what types of hay are available to you in that area. If you purchase a new horse, you should always find out what feed and the amount it was given daily so you do not change the food too rapidly and cause colic or other problems. Overfeeding can cause founder and problems too, so you should always weigh your feed..... a coffee can of oats is not going to be the same weight as a coffee can of corn, nor a coffee can of sweet feed, and you want to stick to the same amount of feed daily in graining them. Hay can be fed free choice, which is the healtiest way to hay them as in their natural enviroment, they do not get grain and eat grasses all day .

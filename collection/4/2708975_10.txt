Your dog is still young.  The best way to slim down a Lab is to take him swimming as much as possible.  I wouldn't take the food away so soon, as a general rule puppies will only eat what they need.  By taking the food away so soon you will teach the dog to gorge himself when the food is down.  I feed all of my Labs Iams dog food and they don't eat as much but they maintain a solid, muscular appearance.  At 8 months I wouldn't worry about fat, the dog will grow into himself and burn all of that excess off.  It is when they are 3-4 yrs old that you need to start worrying about their weight.

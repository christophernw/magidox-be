The deal with component cables assuming you are talking about the Y, Pb, Pr is that they are designed for progressive scan signal. The letter i in 1080i stands for interlaced. The best resolution for use with the component cables is your 720p which is actually better then 1080i. You see the lines of resolution on a interlaced signal are refreshed at 1/60 of a second and alternate every other line so the entire screen does not refresh all at once but more like half and half. Of course this happens way fast. The progressive scan refreshes each line in sequence from first to last at a rate of every 1/30th of a second so use them components and set your DVDs output to its highest resolution ending in p such as 480p or 720p and you will be on the road to great movie experience

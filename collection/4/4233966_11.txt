If you had to live on this border you would understand.  Wanting to keep the illegals out is not opposing the free flow of labor, it is opposing the free flow of illegal alliens as well as illegal narcotics.  It also opposes (as you put it) the free flow of violent and sometimes fatal attacks on United States Border Patrol Agents as well as other local law enforcement officials, and innocent civilians.  Have you forgotten about the railway killer?  He was recently executed in TEXAS for the murder of several innocent civilians in the United States.  God I love Texas.

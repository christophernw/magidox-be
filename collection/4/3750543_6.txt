Rap is a genre of music that tends to promote the degredation of black people. The artists lack any real muscial talent, the lyrics are vile and speak mostly of sex, drugs, or gang violence, the music videos depict nearly-naked women in seductive attire while dancing provactively--shall I go on? This is what BET chooses to air all day long, and this is what young black children all over the nation are constantly exposed to: this ignorant, crass, vile, and degrading music that's broadcasted as "entertainment". I can't stand it. Songs like "It's hard out there for a pimp" or "I'm in love with a stripper"--are absolutely offensive and disgusting to me. How are we supposed to promote better standards of living and working for African Americans if our TV role model is 50 cent and  Snoop Dogg?

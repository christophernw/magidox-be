Put your shoes up where your dog can't get them.. . Yeah, I know you werent looking for a smart@$$ answer, but after owning my dog for a year and having him destroy some expensive shoes and work gear, I started learning that the best way is to keep it out of his reach because he always did it when I wasn't there.. . And they say you cannot punish a dog for things he did more than x amount of minutes ago because he doesnt remember. Who knows? . . Also, he may be doing this out of bordem or is angry at you for leaving him alone. I don't know when he tears up your shoes or any other circumstances, but that might be something to look into.

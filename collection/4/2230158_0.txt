I'm guessing your dog is the one barking? =0) Pet stores sell bark collars that either beep at a really high pitch when they bark to annoy them or there are ones that beep first to warn them and then deliver a mild electric shock if they don't stop. We had a sheltie puppy that barked all day but the collar worked. Eventually we only threatened to put the collar on and he would be quiet

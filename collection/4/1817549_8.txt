I am a italian love machine.  I eat only pickled pigs feet and moose ankles.  I am the greatest alive just ask my grandma.  I have to retort with a response.  Most of my italian familia couldn't fit through a door unless they go sideways.  Nobody can tell my grandma is my answer for me baby yeah.  Don't tell me how to live.  If I want to eat let me I will not be skinny for you.  . . Love me grandma. Merle Lee Lee Hirt

k.. i just asked this question to my pastor.... he told me that in the bible it says that ppl do have this gift .... BUT... in order for it to be true there must be a person to interpet it...  ( if God puts this gift in someone at church he will also put in someone the gift of interpetation )... this is God's way of letting us know wut is real and what is not...

Many people of the Christian faith are convinced that the Jews murdered Jesus.  The Bible plainly states that a Roman Judge sentenced him to death and his Roman soldiers carried out the execution.  I could never figure this out myself.  A lot of it might have to do with the treatment of Palestinians by Israelis.  This is a very complicated subject.  I could go into it further, but this is not the place for that.

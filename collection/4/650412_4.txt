It depends on how bad the sprain is and if there was any tendon damage.  It is best to stay off of it when possible and put ice on it, if you don't have a ice bag a bag of frozen peas will work.  It takes a sprain several weeks to start mending, I sprained my ankle in August and it still swells even tho the pain is gone.

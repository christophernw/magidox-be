we can all agree that women have as much right as men when it comes to practicing polygamy, but it still would be sneered at in any society. It ofcourse has a biblical background; it was always like "take the woman you like, as long as you gave her father the proper dowry, and you kept your other wives satisfied"; and "if you found your daughter/wife/kinwoman committing 'adultery', take her outside the town's gate and stone her behind". So even The Almighty [who is a Male by the way] is prejudiced against women. I've heard it being said that it would hurt a man more than it does a woman if he found hiswife cheating. Which has something to do with his.. you know.. role as "the man of the house", "the provider", the "head of the house" etc etc thing (which, again, has a biblical background) - implying failure in his duties (as a man and the wearer of the "trouser" in the house). What we can safely conclude, therefore, is the bible is responsible for centuries of ill-treatement of women. . . Which is why i stopped believing in it!

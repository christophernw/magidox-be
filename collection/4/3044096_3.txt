Acquire a box of Bisquick at your local grocery and there will be instructions on the back of the box. Follow these instructions. I like to substitute Buttermilk for normal sweet milk simply because I find it makes the pancakes fluffier for some reason and they taste so much better. Don't mix your batter too thick you want it to run when you put it on the griddle. Allow enough batter to run outwards to make approximately 6-8 in flat pancakes. Stack your pancakes three high, top with a pat of butter while still hot and finish with 'Vermont Maid' syrup. YUM!

Or if you mean your background (not round), I would assume that you mean one that fits your personality and lifestyle.  Then the way is to STUDY about the different breeds and their personality types.  Call breeders of breeds you are interested in and ask them for advice.  You may be surprised at some of what you find.  For example, people often think that a Greyhound, because they are so fast, will be a hyper freak of a dog.  They do need to get good exercise, but otherwise are just big skinny couch-potatoes.. . Search the web, including the AKC site and you will find lots of info about their personalities and their needs.  Some require much more maintenance than others.  It requires a big commitment to get a dog.  They are going to live anywhere from 7 to 18 years, depending on breed.  . . I think the best dog is a mixed breed (mixing seems to undo some of the problems caused by bad breeding and in my mind makes a smarter healthier dog) and the best place to get one is the local animal shelter or Humane Society.  You get to save it's life and often you get to give them their first GOOD home.  Some may just be runaway pets but many are abandoned or abused.  They are due a break.  . . Go and spend lots of time getting to know them.  If you choose based on cute alone, you will probably regret your decision.  Just like with people, cute doesn't last--the right personality match does.

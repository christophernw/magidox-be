ear candling is fine. I've done it a bunch of times. Get a set that has instructions with it, and maybe ask someone working in the store for advice on if they are the right thing for what you have. they are usually used for getting the wax out, but they are used to treat ear aches and infections as well. if you don't feel comfortable doing it at home, you might be able to find an alternative heath practitioner in your area who does it.

I think that he would just OMIT the part about being an executioner, because the number of executions  in a given state are few and far in between. The chances of this person being executioner for the entire U.S. is not realistic.The position of executioner is a part time position, and the person is probably  retired, or has a regular job, possibly in the corrections system.

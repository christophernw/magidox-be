Whether it behaves like a wave or like a particle depends on what you are doing to the photon to make it behave in such a manner. Early experiments displayed the results of such duality behavior. Einstein first postulated that effect back in the early 1900's. Below is a link to a site that will explain in more layman's terms the theory as well as other theorems built upon the work of others. Good Luck.

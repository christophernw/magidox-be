We have taught our dog "key words" that mean things like when I say "num-a-num" that means food or a treat and "go bye bye" means we are going somewhere in the truck and he goes straight to the truck and waits for us to open the door. When I want him to stop doing something I say "no more, that's all" and he goes back to his resting place.. He's funny because he loves to chew on ice and I'll go to the freezer and say "are you ready?!" and he hunches down and waits for me to throw him a piece of ice. I don't even have to have the freezer door open.........he's ready!. It wont take long for your dog to catch on.

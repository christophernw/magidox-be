a dative covalent bond is basically the same as convalent bond where electrons is shared among the atoms. However, in a dative bond, both the electrons come from the same atom or donor instead of the normal type of convalent bond where each atom donate one electron each.. . One example is that of NH3-BF3 where the lone pair of electrons from the nitrogen is donated to the boron which has a vacant orbital or shell (since boron has only 3 e- on it outer most shell used up already with covalent bonding with 3H)to accept the two electron in the process forming a dative bond.

Ok, lets look at what diabetes does to the body.. . I will assume you are talking about diabetes insipidus (high blood glucose).. . When you have high blood glucose the osmolarity of your blood increases (More "stuff" is dissolved in your blood). Water will always travel from a low osmolaity to a high osmolaity down its concentration gradient until an equilibrium is established.. . When one has lots of glucose in their blood the osmolality is increased and water enters the blood. This INCREASES its volume.. . If volume of the blood increases pressure increases within the blood vessels. Thus your blood pressure goes up. . . Your kidneys usually help regulate blood glucose and volume. Yet often the proteins in the kidneys which help filter substances are overloaded by the excess glucose. People who have diabetes insipidus also lose excess water in their urine because it contains increased concentrations of glucose. Thus the body loses water at a greater rate.. . When the body loses water it releases a hormone known as ADH. This hormone causes the kidney to attempt to retain the water it is losing and also causes vassoconstriction of the blood vessels. This amplifies the high blood pressure effect.. . P1V1=P2V2. . When the blood vessels constrict volume decreases increasing the pressure. . . This is a cycle that unless controlled can lead to serious health complications.

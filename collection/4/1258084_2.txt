The words for hell and sheol in Greek simply mean the common grave.  Exekial 18: 4 says the soul that is sinning it itself will die.  There is no firelike place of torture after death.  If you do your best to obey God's commandments you will experience the words of Psalms 37:29.  If not, you will simply die, done, over, non-existance.  No shadowy thing leaving the body.  That is not a Bible teaching.  You live forever on earth after Armageddon, or you die there.  If you die before Armageddon you will be brought back to life, whether you were good or bad.  Then you will get the chance to live under God's Kingdom (Dan. 2:44, Matt 6:9,10).  There you will be judged.  Then you will keep living or be permanently destroyed.

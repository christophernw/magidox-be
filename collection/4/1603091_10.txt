I looked up this verse, and another translation says, . . "and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge". . . This is a good statement.  Perpetual motion machines are impossible, yet, many bright people keep trying to invent them, even though they contradict knowledge that is well known.  . . I think this is a statement in support of being a skeptic, and to not believe things that do not make sense.  I see it supportive of good science, and against bad science.  . . Buddha says, “Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, no matter if I said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and common sense.” – Buddha. . The bible says, "Keep my commandments and live.  Get wisdom!  Get understanding!" -- Proverbs 4:4-5. . Galileo says, “I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason and intellect had intended us to forgo their use.” -- Galileo Galilei. . However, fundementalists cause people to feel like this, “Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise.  During almost fifteen centuries, the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial.  What have been its fruits?  More or less, in all places, pride and indolence in the clergy; ignorance and servility in laity; in both, superstition, bigotry, and persecution.” – James Madison, 4th President of the United States . . or, “The Church says that the Earth is flat, but I know it is round.  For I have seen the shadow on the moon, and I have more faith in Shadow than in the Church.” – Ferdinand Magellan. . I always worry about any fundementalist or evangenical, who wishes to impose their ideas on others.  However, the issue is not about science and the internet.  It is about control.  . . Take care!

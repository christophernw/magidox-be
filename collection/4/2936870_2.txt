The confederate flag is all about context. Many Southerners would consider the flag a symbol of pride in the Southern way of life. Few outside the South recognize this, since many outside the South believe the Southern way of life involves inbreeding and missing teeth, which it does not. It usually involves Southern hospitality, REALLY good cooking (not necessarily healthy cooking), and in many cases a deep devotion to religious beliefs.. . If used in a hateful context, such as to celebrate slavery, the flag may be considered offensive, but it's display, to my knowledge, would still be protected under the First Amendment in this context.. . If used in a violence-promoting context, like encouraging revolt against the government or promoting violence against minorities, First Amendment protections may not apply. Consult your local constitutional expert.

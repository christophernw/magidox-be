There is lots of history of real countries, cities, dynasties, laws, cultures, customs, people, deities, faiths even other than Judaism and Christianity recorded in the Bible. Even certain people who were recorded in the Bible who were said to not really exist, later archaeologists have found they really did live. More has been found to prove the Bible than disprove it - and people have tried to. That is why even today globally the Bible has such an impact on people.. You can shut your eyes, your choice but the Bible is the most fascinating book that no other surpass and factual.

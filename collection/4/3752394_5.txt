Good point u came too, . Why? , . i think because for The prophet cartoons, these cartoons were a direct insult for most precious person for any muslim in the world,so how ever how the person is educated he&#92;she will understand the insult and will protest against it. . . then why this doesnt' happen for terrorism?... i think this have many reasons,. 1. the most remarakable terrorism action is 9/11 and it was against americans, and many muslims dont like americans, so they didnt care that 2000 americans were dead, then the question why they dont like americans? for this answer check this : http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=Ah3tUGeQCVPkY2mLcZSIecjsy6IX?qid=1006041322001. . 2.Many islamic leaders already objected on the terrorism actions and trying there best to stop it. . . 3.For the muslim youth (at least as i see them in my country), why protesting against terrorism which kills americans and israelians, in the time those americans and israeilans are killing muslims in afganistan, Iraq and were killing then since 50 years in palastine and STILL killing them there till now, so we do they protest ?, by their way of thinking, it's just justice! . . That doesn't mean that terrorism is accepted at all, just when u r attacked and killed and your land is taken and occupied dont expect that those occuped people will go and protest for the occuper rights ? that doesn't make sence right ? . . 4. For me ( I am a muslim girl) i would like very much to go and protest against terrorism , but you dont undestand that protesting and making demonestration is something very hard in here, and would lead to many bad results, it's not easy at all to go and say "No for terrorism" the way the police and government deals with demonestrations in here still needs great developing to be really modern.. .  I hope you got the others point of view about the whole matter.

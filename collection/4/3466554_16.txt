dog find stuff to chew on when they get bored....so after a long walk...he will be tired....get him a kong toy and other toys and bones....and alternate the toys once in a while so the toys will stay interesting to your dog....good luck!. . whenever u know that your dog is going to go get a shoe...say no assertively when your dog is walking towards the shoe..... . do not buy toys that look like shoes or give her old shoes to play with...your dog will start chewing any show because he wont know the difference between a new and an old shoe...for him its just something nice to chew on.... . good luck!

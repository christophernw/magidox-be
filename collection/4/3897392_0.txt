The bubba's are racist and homophobic.  I live in GA and our republican governor Sonny Perdue got elected because  he promised the rednecks they could vote to get the old flag back, which was offensive because it had the old Dixie flag on it.  He lied by the way and there never was a vote on changing the flag back.

I think it's because no one cares about their fellow man anymore.  The idea isn't to help someone to get to their location safely, it's to hinder them as much as possible.  People want to drive 5-10 miles under the speed limit and not get out of your way when you want to pass, until you actually start to pass, then it's their job to speed up and get in your way again.. . It's either human nature or it's because everyone is brain dead due to radiation all the ^(*^&*% cell phones are zapping into their heads while they're driving.. . If they're on a cell phone...definately empty the entire magazine into their brain pan.

Evolution does not disprove Adam and Eve. It doesn't disprove God it confirms that He exist by the pitfalls in its own theory. It is proven that life cannot come from no life or from something inanimate. The search should be of Bible truth and the prophesys relating to this time we live in which is nearing the end when Jesus will come again.

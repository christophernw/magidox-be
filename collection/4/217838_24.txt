I don't really believe what the Bible says. But you know what? I don't rag on people who do. People have a right to they're own beliefs. If you don't want to be a Christian, then don't be a Christian. But leave people who want to believe alone. How would you like it if they constantly hounded you just because you don't want to be a Christian?

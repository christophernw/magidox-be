well the recruitment process must be delt with accuratly, as they need experienced, wise, and trustworthy staff, they also need to ensure they employ ethnic minoroties, i do not see alot in banks in the uk, and that is strange. and with the advertising, it is important as to attract customers, because nowadays, banks dont only offer current accounts, savings accounts and loans, NO they also offer mortages, insurance, and other services.. so their advertisments are really important as to deliver the correct information to attract more customers.

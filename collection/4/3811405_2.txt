It means that I will be down in San Jose, Costa Rica celebrating it at the Imperial Brewing Company Park where the Americans living in Costa Rica throw their annual 4th of July shindig and that I will be drinking that fantastic Imperial Light beer and having fun with all of the beautiful ticas (Costa Rican women)!. . VIVA LA PURA VIDA!!!!!!

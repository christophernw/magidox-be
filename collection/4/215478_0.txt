Physics is the science concerned with the discovery and understanding of the fundamental laws which govern matter, energy, space and time. That is, physics deals with the elementary constituents of the Universe and their interactions, as well as the analysis of systems which are best understood in terms of these fundamental principles. Physics is a study of the inorganic, physical world, as opposed to the organic world of biology, physiology, etc. Chemistry concerning the electro-chemical interactions of substances overlaps with physics.

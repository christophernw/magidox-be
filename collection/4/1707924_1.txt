The idea is that they are so mentally disturbed as to have no moral code and therefore did not commit the crime willingly or intentionally as they would have if they were of sound mind.  It's not that easy to be declared insane, though.  Example: Jeffrey Dahmer (about as nutzo as they come, look him up) attempted to make insanity his defense but it was denied.  It's not like courts accept every plea of insanity.

you know i wish i could tell you because i have the same problem .. all i know is take weight gainer and increase your daily intake of calories by 1500 calories on top of the 2000 you are supposed to have.. however this didnt work for me because i have an over active thyroid.. if you are worried about this then go to the dr and they will do a blood test and prescribe you a medication to help regulate it

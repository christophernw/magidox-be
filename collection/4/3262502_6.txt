It releases your emotion. When your sad, you cry. Its like when you have to go to the bathroom, YOU HAVE TO GO!! Then you feel better afterwards. When you need to cry, you need to cry, and the effect is being in a better mood. It also helps to have a big bowl of your favorite ice cream in front of you when you're sad. That always makes me feel better.

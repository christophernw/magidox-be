could be a lot of things.  The "check enginge" light means that something along the way isn't exactly right.  If you checked your oil, try checking your trans fluid.  Its the other dipstick on the engine block.  Try checking your air, fuel (wait till the car is TOTALLY cooled off), and oil (will require changing your oil) filters.  Could be one of those.  Check your brake fluid, as well as your radiator fluid and resevoire.  Also, check the fuses, both under the steering wheel and under the hood, for any burnt out fuses.. . Its hard to tell what it could mean if something is not OBVIOUSLY wrong.  If its not doing anything funny, then just call a mechanic or the dealer and see if at sometime in the near future you can go get it put on the Diagnostic tester.  It will cost you a chunk of change (especailly if you go to the dealer), but they will defanitely be able to tell you what is going on.  Also, give it a week or two, it might just be a glitch, it might just simply work itself out.

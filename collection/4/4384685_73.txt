Truffles/Fungus are common all over the world.. You have to do a little work for them.. In France they use the Hype of a Pig rooting them out (Fungi is a favorite food of all Swine), give it a fancy name, restrict it's distribution, charge an exorbitant price, and Viola it's a delicacy.. Mushroom/Fungus harvesting is a cultural part of Appalachia and various Wild Fungi appear at different times of the year.. In reality truffles are cultivated today, much like the Common White Headed Crap you find in stores.. Not to long ago, PortoBellos were not readily available and today appear in their cultivated form in your supermarket.. The most expensive would be the one you harvest yourself.

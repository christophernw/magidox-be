Well, I know quite a few stupid people, and they've done some crazy things.  For instance, I was on a school trip to San Antonio, Texas with school one time, and a group of my friends was trying to cross a busy 4- or 6-way highway.  One of my friends just walked right out on the highway and crossed it at a leisurely pace!  I thought that wasn't the brightest thing to do!  Oh, by the way, she made it across OK.

Ah yes. Med school and lots of it. Becoming a pediatician is a long gruling process, but hey when deal with kids medical needs the education process is very much needed. I suggest that you start taking advanced chem and bio classes, because as I was told when I stupidly wanted to be an ER doctor, if I couldn't hack those I had NO business getting invovled in any kind of medical school.

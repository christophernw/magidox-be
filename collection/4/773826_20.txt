If you hate the world around you , maybe you missed you're calling. Try to find a way to correct what you hate, try to get others interested.Get rid of the baggage that caused you to feel this way, and get on, otherwise you will only make the relationships with other people of significance run from you, or Is It you want to be alone, and do nothing?????????

Same here I work by myself in a room by myself staring at a computer over half the day by myself...  I usually move the desk around, try to do something differently, try to find a faster way of doing something so I can get done with my work and walk around the plant and make human contact.  Luckily I have a radio but it gets boring.  Sometimes I will actually go find someone from mgmt and ask if they have any interesting work that needs to be done, just for something different to do.

homosexuality became the fashion of this age, there is linkage between civility and homosexuality, i will not discuss the matter from religious point of view, as far as i know it is damned in both Islam and Christianity.. my own point of view, it is against human nature, but, if people like to do it politely, away from disgusting actions, like moaning in the street, trying to attract other people, it could be OK then.

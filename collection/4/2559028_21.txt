Technically, etymologically, it just means someone "without God.". . But to me, athieism means not believing in the supernatural.  The natural is what it is.  We may never undestand it all, but we don't have to ascribe what we don't understand to a magical being.  Magical thinking has done enough harm in the world.. . I don't hate Christians any more than I would hate someone who believes in Astrology, the Easter Bunny, or the Loch Ness Monster.  They are just deluded.  I pity them a little, but not too much - we are all fools at one time or another.. . I don't want to destroy religion.  I do wish people would come to their senses.  I don't think that it would help to try and destroy religion - history shows us that when society tries to force progressivism on believers, fundamentalism is created.  This is a step that they have to take on their own - they cannot be forced.. . I don't believe in the soul.  I do believe in the brain.  I do believe in the abstract concept of the mind, even if it is only a useful delusion (like the "windows" on my computer screne.)  But the soul?  No, I see no reason to believe in it.  I'll have to use the Razor on that one.  For some, it may be a "useful delusion", but if you don't believe in life after death, that what is the soul?  It is just the mind.. . Peace,. Kevin

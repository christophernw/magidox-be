There is just so much evidence behind evolution.. For decades people have been gathering fossils and researching DNA and all paths seem to lead to evolution. . A lot of people believe in evolution because there is hard evidence to back it up, as opposed to religion, where there is no hard evidence to prove the existence of GOD. It's just blind faith and a lot of people need to see things to believe them.

You don't have to run from bill collectors. There are laws to protect consumers in this country, specifically the FCRA and FDCPA that tell bill collectors to leave you alone. . . All you have to do is send a "cease and desist" letter (C&D) to them and they are barred by law from contacting you again via phone or through mail. Just write: "Based upon my rights via the FCRA and FDCPA I am demanding that you cease any and all communication with me regarding this debt.". . That's it.

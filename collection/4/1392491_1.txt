That depends on your definition of communism.If it has anything to do with what happened in the soviet union and china then i'd say :bad.If you want to keep an open mind and believe that all people should be paid the same and a generous amount then :good.Communism can be whatever we want it to be we can take the old ideals that were good about it and leave the bad behind.Or start over from scratch.There's no law that says we can't.To those who would have a knee jerk reaction to the mere mention of communism and dismiss it altogether I would ask you;what do you know about it other than what other people have told you to believe?Are you ready to think for yourself and actually read the manifesto and really try to understand what Marx was trying to accomplish?Are you open to the idea of social democracy?After intense scrutiny of Marx's work I've come to . the conclusion that what he really wanted was a system of social credit.Unfortunately some very bad people took his ideas and distorted them until they were unrecognizable and called it communism anyways and it got bad rap.In a democracy I think it's important to think creatively and critically about the choices we make politically and consider all the options if we are to have a sane and fair system of government.Communism is a viable option if we do it right.

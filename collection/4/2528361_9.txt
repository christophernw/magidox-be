To say we close our eyes when we sleep is to say we have something to do with it but we don't. Our eyes close automatically. Whether our eyes are open or shut is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. The condition is involuntary. Although while awake we can close our eyes voluntarily as soon as we stop thinking about it they openand we do not have to think about keeping them open. As soon as we lose consciousness they automatically close. Closed eyes help us sleep and also they are less likely to dry out. . There are people who often sleep with their eyes partially open.

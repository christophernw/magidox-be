I don't really think they're essential to the global eco-system. If you could magically turn all deserts into plains or something, there are certain animals that you would drive to extinction, but I don't think the Earth would suffer because of it..... BUT humans would then populate vast areas (like the Sahara) that were previously uninhabitable, and pollute the Earth even more... so if you look at it that way, they're important because they limit human expansion.

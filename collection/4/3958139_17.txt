Ugh!  Just because a small handful of people insist on "nagging" or being negative in anyway doesn't make us all that way.. . In fact, I've seen more Christians on here bitching about us Atheists than vice versa.  If anything, some of you need to take some Prozac or something!!. . I'm not negative, I'm not depressed, and I'm not mean to anyone on here who asks real questions for real answers.  I respect your beliefs, and I really wish that you all would respect mine and stop generalizing.. . It's getting extremely old, extremely quick.

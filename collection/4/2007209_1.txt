The red hues of the sky at sunset and sunrise are caused by the Rayleigh scattering of blue light by statistical fluctuations in the density of Earth's atmosphere. This also causes the blue diffuse sky radiation. Relatively little red light is scattered in this way, and so the sky often takes on shades of red, orange and yellow.

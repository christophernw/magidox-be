It might be the tie rod is worn and about ready to fall apart.  At the very least your tire will wear unevenly; at the worst you could end up dead.  You better get to a mechanic as soon as possible. Although if it's new, that's unlikely... maybe they left out a few bolts when it was assembled.  Get it to the mechanic anyway.

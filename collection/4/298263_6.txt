Hopefully by studying a manual, reading it PLEASE, then going down to the Department of Motor Vehicles in your city and taking a test of your written knowledge as well as your driving skills.  They will also do a vision test to make sure you can see well enough.  Check your local phone book for the address and number for more info.  GL

Meat is floured so that when you brown it the juices are sealed in and also whatever juices come out of the meat the flour also is a thickening agent. To me the less work when the meat is finished the better. I prefer to flour my meat so it takes less time to make the gravy and then you can sit down and have your delicious meal faster.

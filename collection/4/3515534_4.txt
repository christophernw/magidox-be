Contact the orthodontist that put them on. Most likely taking them off  is part of the all ready paid fees for the braces.  Don't try taking them off yourself--You might crack your teeth that would be much worse & painful.  . Don't even consider this unless you are thinking of wanting dentures in the near future.  I use to work as a dental assisant & this is not a good choice. You could really cause some dental problems in the future.

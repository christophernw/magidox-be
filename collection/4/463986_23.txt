Actually they are not the same.. . Catholics believe Mary was born without sin. A principle faith of Christianity is that everyone was born with sin.. . Another difference is that the Apocrypha (5 books of the Catholic Bible including the Macabees) are not in traditional Christian Bibles.. . Based on these differences, it sets the two religions apart.

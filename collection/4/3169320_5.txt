it sounds like you need to do a little more research on your topic before you go ranting about things you dont fully understand.  there are so many dimensions to an issue like this, such as. adaquate public education, or the lack there of,. being a product of one's environment,. fear of the unknown,. reclaiming of the name,. narrow-mindedness,. ect., ect.. and i'm talking about every race, religion, and ethnic backround.. i suggest you research these things to gain a better understanding of why people tend to do the things they do, and try to look at things from another person point of view and life situation before you start throwing around blanket terms.. and remember, you must BE the change you wish to see in the world.

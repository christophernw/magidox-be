you would start out by baking the chocolate cake in the pan by itself. bake it take it out of the pan and let it cool.. . Make sure you dont use a small pan ....use the bigger rectangle pan and only one box of choc. cake mix, that way when the cake is done baking, you have a one inch think cake.  let it cool completly. put it in the fridge as cake is easier to work with and the icing wont melt when you put it on.. . Bake the white/ yellow cake the same way doing the same thing.. . Now....if your really good...... . cut both of the cakes in half....dont cut down the longest side....cut down the middle on the short side.... . frost one half only of each color...so you will have two peices of dark and two peices of yellow.....only frost one of each coler..... . stick the yellow on top of the yellow and the choc on top pf the choc.. . this gives you one yelloe layer cake...and one choc. layer cake...now..... . take a lot of icing and ice one edge on each cake....put the cakes together to form the original size of the cake pan..... . this results in one,  two layered, two flavor cake...and when people notice that you did it yourself.....you will be praised!!. . dont worry...i know this is long...but its actually very simple....and no..there isnt anything you can buy that will bake a cake in seperate colors...your gonna have to do the seperating..... . email me for further assistance...i do this all the time. . -------- MELD1707@YAHOO.COM----------

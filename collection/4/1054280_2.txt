Zionism is pro-Israal, I believe.  I know more about Nazi-ism.  Nazi-ism refers to the National Socialist party of Germany which was elected in 1933, and then Hitler became Chancellor and turned Germany into a fascist state.  In German, National Socialist would be abbreviated by the first two syllables of the word National--pronounced, Natsionaal in German, hence the name Nazis.

Definitely cut out table scraps and extra treats that you may be giving your dog (or that others in your family may be giving your dog). Feed a premium quality kibble (one that doesn't have a lot of fillers like corn that are just "empty calories"), and feed only the amount specified on the bag. Don't do free feeding -- feed your dog in two scheduled times a day. Or, if you are going to do free feeding, set out only the amount of food allotted to your dog each day (don't just fill the bowl freely). . . Also, very important, make sure your dog gets exercise. Just like humans, you need to increase exercise while decreasing calorie intake. Give him an extra-long walk each day when you have time (e.g., after work). Play a session of fetch that you wouldn't normally do. Good luck!

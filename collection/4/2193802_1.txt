Honey take ADVIL.. . 1st. Sex wont help all. . 2nd I dont care how you spell.. 3rd Heres why advil works... . Advil, unlike other pain meds and midol, is a blood thinner. you have cramps due to clotting, and what not. . . My suggestion is to take two to three advil. Start with two, and if it doesnt kick in soon take a third. Gel caps work faster. . . Next, take a hot shower/bath directing the shower head to your lower back. If you have a jet tub, thats better. Or use a heating pad  on your lower back. It will help relax your muscles and your cramps to pass. . . Good luck.

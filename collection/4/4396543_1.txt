Typically you will asked questions such as: what are your strong points, what is your biggest weakness, how did you handle a conflict with a co-worker, what are some of your greatest accomplishments, what is your ideal work environment, where do you see yourself in a year....practice your answers.Do some research on the company. Dress professionally, get a good haircut. Skip the cologne. You're going on an interview, not to the club. Smile, look your interviewer in the eye, give a firm handshake.Best of luck to you!

When in doubt, try something natural to combat nature's smelly things.  Find a store that sells essential oils and find one that you like (maybe something citrus or earthy so it doesn't smell too girly or sweet).  Get some baking soda) and mix it with many drops of the oil.  Sprinkle it inside the Explorer and let it sit for a while.  Then vaccuum it up and it works like a deodorizer (only better).  I found that this works on my carpet at home where the dog peed or rubbed her butt. You can also combine an oil with water and spray it inside (being very careful not us a lot of oil that can damage things).

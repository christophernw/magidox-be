I like non-fiction, because it can definitely relate to something real, something that happened to you in eal life, so there is a way of communicating with the realistic story element. I also like fiction, but I feel that it is never touching or you might not be able to relate to it in real life. My favorite non-fiction book is called The Kite Runner, which I can definitely imagine and relate to better than my favorite fiction book called Lord of the Fies. I can put my self in a realistic situation and think back to the non-fiction book, and say "This is how it happened in The Kite Runner." I cannot put my self in a fiction story Lord of the Flies and say "This is how it happened."

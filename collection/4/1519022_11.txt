goverment makes to much money , the answer it not because it is a gateway drug , there are many of us that wouldn't consider doing drugs but do partake in a natural plant now in then , in a way it's a gateway drug because if the situation it puts you in , if you go to buy weed odds are they have some coke to , weed itself does not make you want to do drugs. but if they legalize it you wouldn'tbe put in that situation and then it couldn't even be considered a gateway . that's like saying cigarettes is a gateway to beer

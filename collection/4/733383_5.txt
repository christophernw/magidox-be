First, regardless of your religious affiliation, there is a comman ground.  That ground it faith.   All religious persons have faith in what ever they believe in.  But the real test is love.  Faith without love is a car without gas.  The religious may be empty and not full.  Full of God's love and as one who experiences God's love I can proclaim that God's love only comes through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  Other may be religious or believe in what they have been tought or their heiritage in a religion but unless there has been a true relationship with Jesus Christ then we are just religious no matter what title we put on our belief.  Muslim, Christian, budest etc.  Only truly personally knowing Jesus is there true love.  God is Love and He gave His only son to us to pay the price BUT we must chose to believe and trust Jesus and accept Him as the living son of God.  He shows us the way and the Bible is the map.  We follow Jesus in His example of love and we base our walk on the living Word of God.  So Rude, no Love is to be shared.

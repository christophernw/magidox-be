Kinetic Energy is defined by the equation . . E = .5*m*v^2.. . I assume the last part of the question says that they are traveling at the same speed.  So take the ratio of the energy of one car to the other.  If the numbers given are the weights of the car then you would have to convert that to mass by using the equation . . F = MG. . where G is gravity's acceleration and F is the weight of the car(750kg and 1500kg). No matter if the given info is mass or weight the ration will turn out to be the same. So you really dont need to convert but to be more accurate I included this in the derivation. Thus . . M = F/G.. . Plug this into the ration of the two car's energy and you have . . .5*(750/G)*v^2         I dont know how to put a line between. .5*(1500/G)*v^2        This is the top divided by the bottom. . The .5,G,and v^2 will all cancel and you have 750/1500. So the relation if they are going the same speed will be the mass or weight of one car over the other.

An order that forces you to hand over some of your property for use by the government. For instance, during the Second World War, the government requisitioned the iron railings that surrounded many parks and gardens. The railings were carted away and used as scrap metal to make tank and aeroplane parts. (At least, that was the story told at the time; it turned out that the railings were never used for anything and the government just threw them all away.)

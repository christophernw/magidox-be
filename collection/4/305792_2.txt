I'm "assuming" you are talking about a piece you've made right? And you want to get the hand oil off the edges? Put a little dishwashing liquid (or mild detergent) in a pan and add warm water. Using both hands, take the cross stitch piece and dip it into the warm water. Don't scrunch it up or crumple it, just dip it in and out of the water and swish it around. If there are "spots", use an old toothbrush and gently scrub the spot. Then gently run clear warm water over it until all the suds are gone. Then hang it up to dry.

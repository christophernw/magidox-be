I am so sorry to say this but you don't. It is sad and depressing to see this to happen to your parents but it takes 2 to make it work. I rather want my mom and dad to be happy instead of being miserable, stressed, and have full of hate living in the same house and could end up hurting each other(violence, or something bad). I'll pray for you and your parents.

Don't be confused my friend.  The standard for tipping used to be 10%.  Some where along the line, somebody decided to give you guys a raise and nobody informed me.  Having your tips raised by 50% is quite a pay-raise if you ask me.  . . I mean, lets be honest with one another...  Its doesn't take alot of skill, knowledge, talent or insight to pour Vodka into a glass.  You my friend fall into that unfortunate group of people whom have their hands stuck out looking for other folks to supplement their incomes.  . . Waitresses and waiters are another...  They carry a plate to the table give you a glass of water and expect 10 dollars for a serving of four.  Their time spent was about 4 minutes of service.. . I say, if you want better wages, go to college, earn a degree and get a better paying job.  For that fact, buy the phucking bar where you are currently working.  But don't be judgmental on others for "failing" to tip you.  Any tip, is a gracious tip.  It shouldn't be looked down upon.  Believe it or not, most people are just about where you are at... Just barely making it.. . So be kind bro and not too judgmental to low tippers.... maybe that's all they can afford.. . Peace.

This observation is not true for all fresh immigrants from Asia.  But for the few to whom it could apply, I think it could one or many of the following:. 1.Greater exposure to other cultures heritages. 2.Pre conceived notion that most people in this country are dumb probably due to Hollywood, TV or political editorials in foreign press.. 3.Inferiority complex and a scare set in their minds coming from east that they will be conned in the west and they have to always stay on top of the game and keep people at bay â€“ so they try hard to sound smarter and up to the game.

An Anthropologist wouldn't say so (this is in the Anthropology section, so I will answer you in that capacity.) a human is simply an animal with a.) opposable thumbs (though most primates have these) b.) bipedality (though of course birds are better at it) c.) culture (although many other animals exibit culture) and d.) the ability to use tools (though many other animals do this as well.). In short, we are nothing special. I would say culture and tool use are the most important, as bipedality isn't anything special and neither are thumbs, it is, as they say, how you use it. And while other creatures do use tools and exhibit culture we have evolved to a point where it is the main focus of our survival. That is, we don't rely on instinct to do just about anything, in fact, we generally ignore our instincts for the sake of culture. Other animals may use tools and have culture, but instinct is still #1. . . For better or worse.. . Whether or not humans or animals have souls is beyond the realm of Anthropology, but since humans are just animals, then why should we have souls when other animals don't?

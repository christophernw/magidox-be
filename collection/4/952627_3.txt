If you were baptized Catholic (and for the person earlier who said get "baptized again" - Catholics believe in only ONE baptism.  Also you may need to have a copy of your baptism records sent over to your new church if you are not attending the same church you were baptized in), you have to make your communion and confirmation.. . Remember, though, before taking Holy Communion again, you may need to go to confession, speak with the priest of deacon of the church for more clarification.. . Welcome home.

Are you two happy with it? Some people are. But it looks like you are not satisfied (no pun). How does your partner feel about it? How long have you been married? If you still love each other, it may be an emotional or physical thing for one of you (pain with intercourse, for example). If you have kids, are you just too tired? See a doctor or counselor. Really. It's one of the best ways to make progress here. . . If it's just that you are bored with each other, then go out on a few dates and act as if this is your first time together. Try some dress-up and play-acting, or try some erotic videos. But both of you must be willing to work on it. . . If you aren't in love with each other anymore, that's another issue. First you have to decide if you want to stay together and work on it. If not, you'll have to determine the best way to split up. If there are young children involved, you must take their feelings into account, and both of  you must be willing to be fully participating parents even if you are no longer together.

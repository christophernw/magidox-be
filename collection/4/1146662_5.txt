NDS Lite is more comfortable to hold. It's more comfortable than the previous version. NDS Lite's light is also brighter and it has 4 choices of brightness, so you don't have to squint. The first NDS has only 2 choices. The stylus in NDS Lite is much comfortable to hold too. It's slightly bigger and longer than the first NDS which is smaller and shorter. In other words, get the newer version because the newer and improved ones are always much better than the older. Hope this helps.

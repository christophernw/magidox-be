It's self explanatory.. They search, find, then rescue some one.. Search and recovery is the searching for, finding of, bodies and recovering them from where they happen to be.. "Rescue" tells us that some one is alive and needs to be saved.. "Recovery" tells us that some one is dead and the body needs to be found and recovered.

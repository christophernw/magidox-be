I think you wrong people don't hate Muslims, I think the reason you think that way is because of all the bad press they get, just because there are a few rotten apples in the barrel doesn't make them all bad. I know some very nice Muslims who I would consider amongst my closest friends, they sit and listen to me when I talk about my views on God, and I listen to them we never say the other person is wrong because we all know we have the right to believe what we want. I must add I have wondered why with the very large number of Muslims around the world they haven't done something about the bad ones who disgrace with the good name and faith of the Muslim people.. Love & Peace

liberals wont assume power in the states. usa is a conservative country. more so now, than ever before. for example, look at your two most "liberal" states. they both have conservative governors. id hate to see what the "real" conservative states look like, if new york and california is your idea of "liberal". at the same time, there is still some hope for usa. for example, al gore is doing alot to promote environmentalism. if the liberals go into power (not likely to happen), i think we will see more steps made to clean up the environment to slow down pollution. i, personally would like to see high taxes attached to petroleum so people stop driving so much.

i love your point. =) this is actually the point of media today. =) some cross the lines and kill people with insanity. =) anyway, like what the other person said, "freedom" is correlated with the self, thus if people think that everything they say, right or wrong, is always right. it's rather inhuman and very insensitive. plus, people today interpret a lot of things literally.

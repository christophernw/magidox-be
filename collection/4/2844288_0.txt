Its always handy to buy a symtoms and cures book. Sometimes symptoms can come before you get seriously ill, like if you feel chronic fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite those can be symptoms for anemia. But its always good to get a check up to verify because a simple migraine and fever can be a serious tumor...always be careful

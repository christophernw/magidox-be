If I understand your question, a functionalist approach to the law states that it is better to interpret the laws so that they work efficiently, even if they don't quite allow such an interpretation. A formalist approach would require you to interpret the laws as they are written and not try to inject any subjectivity into it. In other words, the judge is stuck with the law as the legislature has written it.

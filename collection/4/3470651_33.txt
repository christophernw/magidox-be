I too am facing the same problem... But I try closing the door consciously by touching the window glass. Alternately, I avoid touching the metal surface lightly and put enough pressure in one go to avoid the jumping shock!!! Try it.. while putting in the key for closing the door lock, hold the key firmly..that should solve your problem...Good Luck!

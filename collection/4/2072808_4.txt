Means you don't get what you want just by thinking so you have to go look for and do something.. . It's the reverse of this example.. Guy 1: I wanna buy a Ferrari.. Guy 2: So dude, what are you doing about it?. Guy 1: err,..  nothing at all. I just want one and I'll.. Guy 2: Yeah, right! pathetic loser.. . The guy 1 is expecting the "mountain"(success) to come to him just by doing exactly nothing.. . Did I make myself clear? :)

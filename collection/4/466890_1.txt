Just follow the instructions like any other game... but if you're having problems while trying to install it, then your pc probably doesn't meet the requirements.  Make sure you have at least 256MB of RAM, but at least 512 is recommended to have a better performance, and make sure that your processor is fast enough.  Also, I think the most important thing is the video card, I'd say that a geforce fx 5200 is fine, you can get them for a reasonable price now.  sorry if i made this too confusing.

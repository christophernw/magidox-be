On your W-2, there is a spot for additional tax withholding.  Put a little extra out of every check toward your Federal Witholding.  Also, claim 0 and Single...they will take out the max.  Other than that, buying a house gives you both the mortgage interest as well as the property taxes as a deduction (if you itemize)

I PRESUME YOU WANT TO TURN IT ON AND LIGHT IT ALSO.. JUST A TAD BIT OF OXYGEN, THEN A TAD AND A HALF OF ACETYLENE. THIS MIXTURE SHOULD RESULT IN NO CARBON SOOT WHEN LIT(WILL TAKE PRACTICE)  THEN LIGHT AND ADJUST FOR THE AMOUNT OF HEAT YOU NEED.  LEAVE A SLIGHT EXCESS OF ACETYLENE SO YOUR FLAME IS NOT OXIDIZING THE METAL DUE TO UNBURNED OXYGEN.

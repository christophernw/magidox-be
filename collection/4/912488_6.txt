Such men need to be told that this may, in the long run, affect their sperm count as tight underwear increases the temperature around the testicles.. The scrotum keeps the testicles at a temperature slightly lower than that of the rest of the body. For the human, a temperature around 34,4 degrees celcius seems to be ideal, whilst a temperature of 36,7 degrees celcius may be damaging to sperm count.. This temperature is controlled by moving testicles closer to the abdomen when it's cold, and away when hot. So men who put tight underwear may be ignorant of this fact and live to go through a low sperm count which could lead to impotence.

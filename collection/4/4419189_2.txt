I don't think there is any ONE reason for it- lots of different relationships have lots of different dynamics. . I will, however, say this: If he is cheating you you while you are pregnant with his child, he will continue to do so. This is behavior that is deeply ingraned in a person & it's highly unlikely that he will change.. Good luck to you, sweetheart! Stay strong for yourself and your baby and do whatever is right for the two of you. It's time to start thinking like a "Mom", instead of a girl.

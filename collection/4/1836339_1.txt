take your dog outside to go every hour and after drinking, eating, playing and sleeping. when he goes outside, praise him alot, if he goes inside, dont say nothing, dont get angry, just clear it up. u have to be patient! if hes gets alot of praise and attention and affection for going toilet outside, he will gradually get the idea. some dogs learn fast, others take time, just remember not to get angry with him and take him outside regularly. got out with him, directly he starts to go, praise, praise, praise!! good luck!

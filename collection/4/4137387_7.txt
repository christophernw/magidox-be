HIV is carried via blood products. Blood, semen. So with an-al sex the an-al lining can get little cuts or tears . (easily repaired by the body happens with large stools (poop) all the time) so when penetrated without a condom and not enough lube (water based only for latex condoms and don't use spermacide treated for an-al sex)  and ejaculated into. the virus has many easly blood contacts to enter. . . The vagina is naturally lubed and still a very high risk for condomless sex, their partners generally are not as high risk. AIDS is growing in the straight community but no where near the numbers in the Gay Community percentages.

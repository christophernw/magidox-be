They can't.  The date of Creation is 4004 B.C.  Dinosaurs were long gone by then.  I asked once if Christians believed in Dinosaurs and was told they were named in the Bible . . . as "beasts".  Then I was told that lava aged the bones to give false results on carbon dating tests.. . This proves that Dinosaurs were Atheists.

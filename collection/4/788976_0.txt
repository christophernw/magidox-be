I've not heard that there was a cover up.  But I'm sure Bush haters came up with that one.  Let's face it, Clinton is to blame for 911m after all he had 8 years to take out OBL which is when the 911 planning was being done.  Bush inherited a mess from ole Bill, slow economy, a military in ruin, and lost respect for the oval office.. Bush has made his mistakes also, but we have record low unemployment, more new home owners, and a military that loves their commander in chief. (I live in a military town)

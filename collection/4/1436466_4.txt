if you are correct that the US gov't is considering defending your home as terrorism, it's total hypocracy on the govt's part.  We have the right to bear arms IN THE CONSTITUTION in order (and i expect you to look this up) to defend ourselves from our OWN GOVERNMENT if they are attempting to seize our property illegally.

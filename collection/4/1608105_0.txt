I know Pi to a thousand places, dont have grilles but still wear braces.. . I do Pythagoras just for fun, Whizz at Minesweeper, Stephen Hawkings in my Library.. . I could sure kick your butt at a game of pingpong, ace any trivia quiz you bring on, fluent in Java Script as well as Kling-on.. . . oh, and I edit Wikipedia,

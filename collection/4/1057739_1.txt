Larger rabbits will typically have more babies.  Also, as a rabbit gets older towards the end of producing baby rabbits she will produce fewer babies.  Cottontails will normally produce 6-8 babies from what I've seen.  The rest had either probably left the nest or were eaten by predators such as cats.

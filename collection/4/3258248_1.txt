Go here : http://www.z-spec.com/catalog.htm. . and click on 'Grand-Am' and then 'Performance' .. about 2/3 the way down the page you'll see a supercharger kit. Will work on your 3.4L motor, but is pricey ($4000). . . As far as cheaper speed, intake/exhaust is the only decent option. Combine it with improved plugs, better motor oil (full synthetic), and you'll see a decent if not amazing upgrade in smoothness and performance. Watch out for excessive noise from your exhaust mods, some people like it, others don't. . . If you're really crazy, and don't mind shortening the life of your engine somewhat, have a local tuner drop you a 50 shot of nitrous... . If I were you, I would look for another vehicle if performance is what you're after :)

If you have the option to do so, try keeping him in his stall during the sunniest parts of the day, and letting him stay turned out all night. During the winter we do the opposite.. So they basically get the same amount of turnout. . . Another option would be to put it on a supplement. "Blackenall" by HorseTech (it's got the NASC seal) or "Black as Night" by Cheval (no NASC seal)... These supplements are supposed to help bay/black horses stay dark and not get the sun fried hair.. . Hope this helps!

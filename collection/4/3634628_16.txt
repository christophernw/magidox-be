I believe in Jesus Christ, He has saved my life many times.. He has been my strength when I felt the weakest, when I wanted to give up all hope, He  would send just the right person to help me  hang on, He helped me see beauty, when I was surrounded by ugliness. When I wanted to give up, on Him, He would send someone, that needed to hear truth, and in doing so, I fed my Spirit as well. He is just awesome.

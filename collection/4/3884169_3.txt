Dear Sir/Madam: the best way is to go too a few Christian churches and first listen and see if the church practices what our HOLY BIBLE says. The talk to the ministers of that church and see how they react to you and don't forget to ask as many questions as you can. I believe you will find that church. . . P.S. Before you do any of that go off by yourself and do some praying that the holy Spirit will direct you to that special church.. . Very Sincerely,. . Ray Logan

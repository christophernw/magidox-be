I trained my rotty and my bulldog to stop by letting them do it and while they are up there lapping all the attention the person they are jumping on steps on their hind paw and at same time pats the dogs head...eventually the dog will associate standing up on his hind legs with pain in the rear feet....do not grind the feet, just firm enough to make him jump down.  same as when dog chases cars...owner gets into a friends car and when your family lets dog go and it chases the car YOU get out of seat in back where you were hiding and give him heck..do this a few times and he will associate you with the next car going past and forget the chases in future too.

not being blameless doesn't make unnecessary force OK... there are many "riot" techniques and materials (tear gas, less lethal bullets.. that sort of thing) and if they weren't equipped for the situation they are mandated to call for backup, not to open fire.  people are going to be t'd off for a while to come over that... granted the mob went overboard on their protest.. but it in no way warranted being shot... you can rebuild a building.. dead is dead.

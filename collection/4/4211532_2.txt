"Bons baisers" used to be used at the end of letters to say "love and kisses".  However, French friends now won't allow me to say it and I have to say things like "bisous" instead because "baiser" is now associated with sexual intercourse.  The James Bond film "From Russia with Love" was "Bons Baisers de la Russie" in French.  Maybe it's his fault!

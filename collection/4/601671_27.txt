We want immigrants we just dont want the illegals. Has nothing to do with them doing the jobs. I could ask you this question. Why dont Mexicans get an education and make their country better instead of coming here and doing it illegally. Cant they see they are breaking the law. DO they care that they are? NO! .   THis has nothing to do with working in the hot sun. It does not give you the right to come here illegally. Why is that so hard for you to understand. It doesnt mean we dont like mexicans; all it means is that you are being disrespectful and breaking OUR laws.

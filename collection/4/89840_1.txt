What exactly are you asking about Israel and what it is doing in the middle east.. I might be the wrong person to answer this as I am an Israeli.. . If Israel did nothing then what... peace and harmony who are you kidding, the situation in the whole of the middle east is not down to just one country Israel, but it gets the blame regardless.. . As to what do I think of it what does anyone think of their home though I am living abroad due to my job situation I will be going back in 2 years for good and I visit 6 times a year.

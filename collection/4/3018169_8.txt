I don't recognize the type of rabbit you're referencing, but if it's a wild rabbit, PUT IT BACK OUTSIDE!!!  The nest will appear like a small, fur- or grass-covered depression in the yard, usually under a bush, but not always.  . . If you found a baby rabbit (eyes closed, ears flat, cottontails have a white stripe on their head) outside, put it in exactly the same spot you found it.  Use your head, though, if there are predators (cats, dogs) about.  Wait 'til they're gone.  Mother rabbits attend their babies just a few times a day, notably dawn & dusk.  Rest assured (unless you see a body in the roadside out front) that Mom knows where the baby is & is in control of the situation.  If the little rabbit has eyes open, ears up & you spotted it grazing, but it simply appears too small to be out on its own, put it back outside & enjoy the show.  Baby rabbits leave the nest pretty early for mammals.. . The care & feeding of wild buns is VERY specialized & is illegal for those without a license.  That said, if the baby is in obvious distress, is injured, or you pulled it out of your dog's mouth, you need to get it some care.. . Call your local 24 hour Animal Emergency Hospital (in smaller communities it may only be open off hours - check your phone book), most of them have vet techs on staff who rehab.  If all else fails, call around to local vets for guidance.  . . But you've probably stumbled (literally!) onto a napping baby who's really just fine & Mom is nearby.  Isn't it cute?

Get plastic ornaments and keep light strings off the bottom. My cats have played in the tree for years and haven't gotten hurt (thank God). Just kitty proof your tree (hang ormaments with yarn instead of wire hangers, and remove tinsel and icicles, tie the tree to ceiling so it doesn't tip over). This is how my kitty looked one morning after a romp with the tree. I just couldn't be mad at him! Good luck! http://good-times.webshots.com/photo/244...

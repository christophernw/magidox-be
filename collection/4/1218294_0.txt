First, sleep with a fan on, it will take alittle while to get use to it, however, it drowns out other noises. Also, call a doctor, I take Ambien, not all the time, just when I need it. If you haven't taken a prescribed medicine then you haven't really tried a sleeping pill. Most over the counter sleeping pills are a joke, they do nothing for me.

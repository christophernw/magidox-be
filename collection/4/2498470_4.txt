They don't. They arrest the primary aggressor , whoever it may be. I have a friend with 20 years law enforcement experience and I'm always asking him these kinds of questions. He says he's worked hundreds of domestics in his career and about 8 or 9 times out of ten it is the male who is the primary aggressor.

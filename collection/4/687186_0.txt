drink alot of water before you go out and when you get home dont eat bread.  eat something greasy before you go out it will coat your stomach making less alochol in your sysytem ie you dont get drunk....if you have a bad hangover choke down 2 pieces of DRY toast this will soak up all the liquid in your system making you feel better. . oh yeah dont take aspirin it causes stomach bleeding

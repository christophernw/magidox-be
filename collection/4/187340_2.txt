you will need to eat a lot of fiber, any carbohydrate will make u put on weight...  eat a diet of cabbage soup, although u might feel week after a few days of this because u wont be getting any nutrients...  eating meat will make your body burn the fat also, but u will not be able to expel the fat from u as soon as u want...

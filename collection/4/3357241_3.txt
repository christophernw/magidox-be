Leave your lips slightly open so as to allow the burp to escape without inflating your cheeks.  Always keep your teeth together to catch any chunks that might otherwise be expelled.  It's a good idea to place your hand in front of your mouth to keep any spittle from flying across the room.  If you are enjoying a meal at the time of your burp always follow the burp with an appropriate compliment like "Woo Wee that was some good eatin'!"  If someone else burps say "If you bring that up again we'll have to vote on it."  By the way in some cultures burping at a meal is considered a compliment.  There is a scene about this in the movie "Lawrence of Arabia".  If you really want to impress a guy give one of those really long loud growly burps followed by shaking your head violently and stomping your foot while you shout "Yummy!  That tastes even better the second time around.  How 'bout a kiss darlin'?"

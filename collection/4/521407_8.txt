I ask myself this question all the time! I have dealt with more tragedies in one life, then many will ever see. I feel that things just happen for a reason and that with things like death that when it is your time, that you will go and have no power over it. . . My parents died in a car accident almost eight years ago and I felt like it was the end of the world. But, tragedy has made me stronger and more accepting of how things are in life. You have to know that life goes on and that you are still left with normal life with family, friends, work and everything else.

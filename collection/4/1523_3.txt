to be balanced. when two opposing forces are equal and opposite, they are balanced and therefore in equillibrium. same can be said of opposing charges. if the positive charge and negative charge cancels each other out, then it is at equillibrium.. . *edit*. just noticed this was in the economics portion. i can't say how this applies to economics, besides having inflow equaling outflow.

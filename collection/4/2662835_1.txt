Mainly induction, that is to say, the power lines are actualy inducing a charge (voltage) into the air, which expands, and contracts, at a rate detirmined by the line's frequency, It can also be caused by the lines themselves actualy moving/vibrating, but this is not usualy the main cause... if you ever want to really hear them hum, or even SEE them ACTUALY MOVE, just watch the lines feeding a large mill, smelter, or anywhere else that might have a HUGE motor (like >2000Hp), when such a large load is brought on line, if it is large enough, and started "acrost the line" the lines will shake, and hum loudly (kind of creepy)... you can (usualy) tell if the line is AC, or DC, by how it reacts to a large load, AC "shakes", and DC "stiffens" (and somtimes shakes a little, and yes, there are still a few HV DC lines)... another cool thing that might intrest you is "corona", which is high voltage trying to leave its line... some HV power lines actualy fainly glow due to corona, when the voltage tries to travel through the air, it creates ions, and frees electrons, thus releasing light (via photo-electric effect), arora is usualy most easily spotted when lines are heavely loaded, and where lines make sudden turns, as HV does not like to turn corners, and can actualy "shoot out" from the ends of a sharp corner... also, household current can hum, in fact, some people (myself included, sometimes, but it MUST be SILENT, and a signifigant load), and most other animals (including cats and dogs) can actualy hear the hum in the walls, for most people to hear it, it has to be on a circuit drawing a lot of current, like a dryer, or air conditioner, anyway, try turning on one of those, and go to your circuit braker pannel, and if you listen real close, and it is very quit, you may be able to hear it.. . High voltage is a horse of another color, and does some VERY strange things, when compared to household 120/240!

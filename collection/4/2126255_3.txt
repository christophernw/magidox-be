I think there are multiple answers to the question.  First, sex workers are a threat to the partners of the Johns.  As such, they are dehumanized as enemies.  Second, rather than enter into a relationship, the workers and the Johns enter into a transaction degrading both parties in an act that should be part of a healthy relationship.  People feel guilt over bad relationships, no one ever feels guilty about a transaction.  Just go into a bank and see someone yell at a teller over a bank error that the teller had nothing to do with. If they were worried about the relationship with the teller they would be reasonable, they want a transaction fixed not a relationship.  Additionally, because sex workers are among the weakest members of society, they are easy to abuse.  This attracts the abusers who futher degrade them.  They are also a source of fear for potential Johns who don't want to enter into the transaction, but fantasize about it and so fear their own weakness.  It is easier to reject the person than put theirselves at personal risk.  Finally, sex workers are much like the Jew in the ditch from the story of the Good Samaritan.  If no one takes responsibility for their well being, then its easier to turn away and pretend they are not there.. . Lastly, many sex workers have broken lives and their own behavior gets in the way.  Sex workers are not the only degraded people, but they are among the saddest group.  They are the true failure in society to protect its weakest members from manipulation and abuse.

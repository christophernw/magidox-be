Cats usually don't just attack out of the blue. But they do have to play- which sometimes leads to using the claws. I had one do that once, and this feline had some large claws. I had to swat his backside to make him let go.. . Keep in mind, too, that a cat is by nature a hunter- and some movements will remind them of prey, on an instinctive level.. . Also, was your kitty scared or perhaps abused in the past? A scared kitty will fight if she feels threatenned.

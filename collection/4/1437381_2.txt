Baking soda is a good solution if you change it regularly. You can also buy activated charcoal, loose or in prepackaged refrigerator filters that will really do the job. They are more expensive than baking soda, but they last longer and work even better. I'v seen them at Lowes and Home Depot. You might also try Bed, Bath and Beyond.

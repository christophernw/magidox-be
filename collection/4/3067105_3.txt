I had the same problem for many years after college.  I heard an adage years ago that it takes three days to form a bad habit and three months to create a good one.  But the real answer is discipline.  I started a schedule where I would go to bed an hour earlier every week and get up an hour earlier.  Not that I am necessarily a morning person.  Still gotta have my Diet Coke!

actually, freeways don't have toll booths either.  I think these are regional differences.  When I lived in CA we called all multi-laned, limited access highways "freeways".  In the Midwest, they are referred to as "innerstates" (spelled Interstates--but I hear innerstates")  I've never lived somewhere where they were called expressways in general (The Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago is referred to as the "Dan Ryan").

It could be emotional reasons. Are you treating her right? When my dog is feeling unloved, she does the same thing.. Is your dog getting the right diet? Maybe you should see a vet and talk to him/her about your dog's food, and if it's current food  is the right choice.. Also, maybe she isn't being let outside enough. She probably just REALLY had to go and couldn't hold it in any longer.

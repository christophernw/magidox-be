I have heard that the squatting exercise is the exercise to use to get that J-Lo booty--Hhhmmmm....  It's the one where you can take weights(dumbells of any weight)and place them in both hands, positioned just above each side of your head, and then squatting down repetitiously. Go down for about 3-5 seconds and then up again; do about 10-20 or more, if you can, for each repetition.  Try it out for a month and see how it works. I know my Booty is Bootilicious because of it!!:)

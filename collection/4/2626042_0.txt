One of the tricks played on newcomers in the space stations is to grab them as they are flying from one side to the other and somehow get away, but leaving them still, with nothing to push on. Being in air, they can swim a little and eventually get back to one side. In space I guess you are out of luck. Venting your suit is not a good idea.

the h1 gas probably gets about 12 or 13, the h2 (suv and sut) get right at 12 for overall mileage, and the h3 gets around 20, with the 5 speed manual and remember the h1 production stops as of today (ends in june) so no more h1's, only humvees from the h1 plants...mileage also depends on the driver and their driving ways and the regular maintenance of the engine and tires and other fluids

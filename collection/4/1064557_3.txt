I have only ever heard of the reference Vagabond meaning somebody who did not (or would not) have a settled home.. One who traveled about doing menial tasks to support himself.. . I believe the term may have come about through the Biblical tale of the Wandering Jew.. . In current time, it means a bum, but do not mix the terms or meanings.. A hobo is one who travels about in an honest manner, albeit, generally hitching a ride on a train without a ticket.. A bum is one who will resort to thievery and dishonesty to move about.

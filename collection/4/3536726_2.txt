While most who mentioned there wasn't enough evidence are right, it's a little more than that.. . There IS evidence that he disclosed the information.  The problem is proving that he did so knowing it was secret etc.. While common sense would tell us it was, it's pretty clear that it is another case where probably even the prosecutor believed he broke the law, but believing and proving something beyond a reasonable doubt are two different things.. . The Republicans accepting him back with open arms just shows again that they do not feel that they have to take responsibility or owe anything to the US people...

The best summer jobs prove to be ones that you can call "seasonal". This would include your snowball stands, lifeguard positions, amusement park jobs, camp counselors,etc. Anything that you can make clear to your employer that you would want to do for the summer only. Ask around and look in community papers and things. One thing you won't want to do is take your time...from past experience summer jobs get taken quickly.

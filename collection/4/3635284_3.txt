Labcorp is a national company that does testing.  Its about $300.  They swab the inside of the child's mouth, the potential father's mouth, and the mother's mouth if she is available.  It is most accurate when all three are present.  It takes several weeks to process the test.  I work with foster children so I have seen it done many times.. . Good luck, I hope this helps.

Ann Coulter attended Cornell University, but i couldn't determine when or if she  graduated.  Attending college doesn't necessarily  make you intelligent; George Bush went to Yale.  She is on television because she is a white, blond, moderately attractive woman who spews the kind of unintelligent drivel that Americans love to watch.  It's basically the same reason Rush Limbaugh is on the radio.

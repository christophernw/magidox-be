in days of old when knights were bold............... from the earliest times, leaders of men in battle had some kind of indicator [flag] to ensure that their men knew where they were, and that they were still there.  . sometimes it was the flag more than the uniform that separated one group from another.  . it was a natural progression for countries to do the same thing.

It actually has been a good hedge against inflation. Gold is considered a safe investment bc it's a hard asset. The dollar is only valuable bc everyone in America says it is. For the long-term gold hasn't been very good, but it can make some money in the short term, I wouldn't buy it right now, though, since I think it's been going down. I'd wait.

Being an Iranian, in particular, won't have much to do with it.  First and foremost, you will have to have the grades and achievements to obtain a scholarship to a university of that magnitude.  Being a foreigner, you will have a better chance than a US citizen and forgive me, but THAT is a major sore spot of mine.  But for the most part, you need the grades and extracurricular activities to win a scholarship to a high end university like that.  Connections don't hurt either.

Look, the best way is to cancel the darned escrow.  They are jacking you around and there are too many houses out there to be going through this.. Is an escrow already opened?  If not then since they have not accepted the terms of your second offer, withing a "reasonable" time, all you have to do is call your realator and tell him to cancel the offer..........it's really simple.. If escrow has opened and deadlines are not being met, you are within your legal right s to cancel that contract, escrow because the terms of the escrow are not, have not, been met within the time specified...............

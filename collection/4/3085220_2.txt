The pink portion of the nail is covering the skin as well as has nerve attached to it. The white portion is "dead" - Please understand it is not attached to the skin and does not have the nerve endings as the pink portion does. As a nail grows the white portion becomes hardened and that is the part of the nail that is the toughest. . . It protects the other pink part from becoming injured.

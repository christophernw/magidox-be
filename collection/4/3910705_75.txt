I don't know but they should. I saw that you got a comment saying that the airplane is too high up. Well this is true but I feel in an emergency situation they could at least go down to 15,000 feet so that way we would have a chance to at least try. I definitely think they need to make more safety features for airplanes because when you are on a place you cannot go anywhere except down and usually people die .

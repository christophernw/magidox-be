And many ancient texts refer to horses as "snorting fire," yet no one wonders if horses really do snort fire when we're not looking... I personally don't believe Leviathan was ever a whale, but rather descendant from the Mesopotamian dragon myths. But even if you were to believe the reference was to a literal creature, there is still no reason why "smoke" pouring from his nostrils couldn't refer to the spray that a whale exhales when it comes to the surface to breathe.

Hmmmm.... . Well if he has a cell phone, check his recent calls.. If he goes to work, get someone you know works there (if you know anyone) to see what hes doing.. If he is capable of telling the truth, ask him.. You can also trick him into telling you if he is cheating on you but its not recommended unless you can garuantee it.. You can do all sorts of things but just remember that in a relationship, honesty and trust are the downfalls.  If you can't trust him, then how are you ever going to be able to be with him?  If you can't learn to trust him, then you shouldnt be with him.  If he didn't give you any reason not to trust him, then you should trust him anyways.

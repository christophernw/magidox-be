The answer to your question may very well be that there is no answer.  The United States considers Israel to be an ally. Israel is a westen style democracy with close ties to the U.S.  The problem lies in the fact that the Palestinans have been goverened by what the U.S. considers to be terrorist organizations, first the PLO, and now Hamas.  While we agree that a solution to the abject poverty and social problems of the Palestinans needs to be found, we are not willing to do it when these same organizations blow up buses and cafes and kill innocent people.  There are those who will argue that Israel does the same thing when they encroach onto Palestinian territory.  The government of the U.S. considers that to be Israel defending itself.  Currently you have a new government in Israel and a new government in Palestine.  The two governments will not have relations of any sort until Hammas agrees to renounce its stated position of the destruction of Israel.  Because of this position and prior terrorist activities, most western nations have cut aid to the Palestinian government.  As far as Israel having alot of weapons, that is because if you look at the map you will see that they live in a very rough part of the owrld, not only do you have the Palestinian government calling for the destruction of Israel, you also have Iran calling for its destruction.  Israel has to remain well armed and tough to survive.  I am sure that thee are those who will disagree with much of what I said, as I stated in the beginning, there very well maynot be an answer to your question.

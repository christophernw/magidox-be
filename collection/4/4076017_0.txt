It's not true!  All subway systems, everywhere in the world have their yards above ground and the rails in that system connect to regular surface rails ... somewhere in their system.  When a new car is delivered to a subway system, it's delivered in a regular surface train to the system that ordered it, it gets switched on the that system's tracks and can be put into service.

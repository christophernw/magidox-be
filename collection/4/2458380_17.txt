If a lot of people are talking good about it....Then they are all stupid!!!!! It is dangerous and can and most likely will kill those who use it. To buy meth because they are to hillbilly ish to buy coke is stupid too, That crap is no better!! It is all bad. Meth is something that you would rather not have ever heard about and is something that should never have come into existence!! Any one disagree,,, then I hope that you learn your lesson the hard way!!!!!!!!!!!!. Its effects are similar to those of cocaine but longer lasting. Crystal Meth can cause erratic, violent behavior among its users. Effects include suppressed appetite, interference with sleeping behavior, mood swings and unpredictability, tremors and convulsions, increased blood pressure, irregular heart rate.. hope this changes anyone's mind who is considering using or trying this product, Chances are you will try it and will be addicted from the first time.

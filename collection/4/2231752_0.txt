I can't necessarily say that salaried always comes out better paid than hourly, though you're more likely to find high-ranking positions being salary.  The biggest advantage to hourly pay is that you have a right to overtime, and because of that, are more likely to have very set hours.  The disadvantage is that it has less flexibility.. . Salaried positions, on the other hand, are *generally* more flexible in hours - some days, for example, you might work 8 - 5, others 9 - 6 or 7 - 4.  The major disadvantage is that you *generally* don't qualify for overtime, and many large businesses will take advantage of that.  Many high-powered salaried employees work way past the standard  5 day, 40 hour work week.

What did you want them to say?  To say "sorry" is a shortened way of saying you have feelings of sorrow.  If you tell someone a relative died, it is appropriate to express the idea that your feelings are understood and shared.  It's called sympathy.  Sure, sometimes it is only said to be polite or to avoid hurting your feelings, but even then, it is the right thing for people to do.

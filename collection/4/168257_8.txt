Caffeine is the number one draw back there...caffeine is actually an amphetamine like nicotine or crystal methadrine...except it is a milder form of speed than some or of those.....but because it is so widely accepted and actually cherished as a stimulant/relaxant it makes one wonder as to the complexities of this device...now no one will tell you that coffee is dangerous...but I used to drink it and I suppose I have one of those "if it feels good do it" personalities...which can be a good or bad thing...in any event...I had to stop drinking it because I drank so much of it everyday that I couldnt sleep well at night...we all walk our own road so not everyone will experience this yet it happened to me...so I guess the best thing I could say is be carefull...

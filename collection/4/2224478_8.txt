Belief in god is absurd.  Belief in god depends on faith but faith is either belief in something without any evidence or belief in something contrary to all of the evidence. That is patently foolish and no mature person can seriously rely upon faith to guide them through life. Sadly, very many people do rely on faith and too often it drives them to acts of aggression and hatred. Belief in humans, on the other hand, drives people to acts of compassion and love. Go figure.

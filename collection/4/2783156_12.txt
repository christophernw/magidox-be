The vibration on the floor shows them a frightening sense of power.  The noise is loud, the machine is terrifying. They fear the worst and imagine their own owner is controlling this uncontrollable monster,of power towards him. I put my dog outside when I vacuum. I have never seen a dog that didn't quiver at the sound and motion of a vacuum except for one. One of my dogs allowed my mother to vacuum his long hair.  He came running when she turned it on.

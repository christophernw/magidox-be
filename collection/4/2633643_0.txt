One of the best questions I have seen on here yet,  My opinion, because the government makes money off of them. For each pack of cigarettes sold, the government gets about $1.00 (probably more now) If they were considered a drug it stands to reason that they would be an illegal drug and the government cannot make money off illegal drugs. (We could argue seizures of such but it still wouldn't balance the scales)

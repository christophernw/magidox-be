Hmmm, there are different trends here. . The first one is eating. People need to eat (moderately) throughout the day. If you're trying to lose weight, three small meals is probably better than two big ones.. If you're tired all the time, you could have anemia - a deficieny of iron in the blood. Check with the docter.. (Or eat more red meat and/or other sources of protein.). . I would also suggest doing some moderate exercise to keep yourself fit. Walking, running, situps, pushups will do wonders, and they're all free. . . . As far as being shy, etc. That's a toughy because there are many possibilities here. Without knowing anything else, I'd say, try to find some activities you genuinely enjoy and join a club or group that does them. Once you're with people with a common bond, it is easier to talk to them, regardless of how you look.

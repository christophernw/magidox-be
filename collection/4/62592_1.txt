Some folks swear by zinc drops...some studies (I'm not sure where to get the particulars of these 'studies') indicate that taking a certain form of zinc reduces the timeframe of common cold symptoms.. . Some folk like drops by the brand name Ricola...they're okay.. . I like drops by the brand name Fisherman's Friend...I think they kick butt.. . At night, I'll take a full dose of NyQuill (yeah, the stuff's nasty, but it works!) every night until symptoms are gone.  If I'm coughing a lot, I'll stay in the shower and breath in steam for a long while...to loosen up the junk.

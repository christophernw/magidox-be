Non-organic food is mass produced on mega-farms. Preservatives and pesticides solve the problems that go along with growing so many crops at one time and in one place, not to mention allowing for a longer time from harvest to consumption.. . Organic food is more expensive because it is more challenging to grow and usually done on a much smaller scale.

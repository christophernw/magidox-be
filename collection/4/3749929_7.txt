I agree with most of the posters before me. Find out what kind of things he/she likes to eat. And bring them over. Being a supportive friend and having patience is very important when you're going through tough times. Usually when people are having problems they tend to isolate themselves from the world to not feel like they are being a burden, so checking up on him/her would make them feel important and possibly be more pumped up about making changes in their life to get out of the rut they're in. Like a poster said, if there's an addiction problem, you might want to take different measures, but remember, pride before downfall. Sometimes we have to put our pride aside to move forward.

I have often wondered this, and I don't know for sure, but I have a few theories.. . 1.  Shower water contains human skin oils/salts which make it tasty. . 2.  Shower water is well oxygenated (because it has been spat out as droplets) and hence tastes different/better - more similar to stream water. . 3.  Cats in the wild tend to drink water from flowing streams - this is because stagnant pools (eg like a water dish) are more likely to have disease causing bacteria growing in them.  A shower therefore probably seems "safer" to the cat.  This is probably why they like to drink water straight out of a running faucet.

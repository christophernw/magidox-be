Someone once told me that some people who are afraid of heights aren't afraid they'll fall; they're afraid they'll jump.. People like that (maybe like you, definitely like me) are drawn to heights, even though those heights are so scary. . With books and TV shows, you get some of the thrill, but none of the fear.

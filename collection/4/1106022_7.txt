Pour half water/half orange juice in blender about half way to the top.. Add frozen strawberries and blend until smooth.  Also delicious to add is frozen blueberries and/or frozen mangos.. . When all is fully blended, spritz in some lemon juice and a little sweetener, not much.  Honey or maple syrup is best.  Only add sweetener if the smoothie is not sweet enough.. . Blend until fully delicious.  Serve.. Happy Smoothie Drinking.  Good Luck.

The area or footage of a perfect square is found by taking the length of a side and multiplying that number times itself.. . So is one side is 3 ft. then the square footage is 3 times 3 = 9 sq. ft.. . If one side is 5 ft. then the square footage is 5 times 5 = 25 sq. ft.. .  If one side is 9 ft then the square footage is 9 times 9 = 81 sq. ft.. And so on.

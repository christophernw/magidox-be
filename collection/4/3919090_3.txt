I can't believe you started crying on the phone.  I understand that it is really hard to take rejection, but you have to be able to control your emotions in the workplace.  You want to be a police officer, if you have had the proper training, then keep trying.  Build up your confidence, and figure out what you could have done to make it work.  . . Make a list of your strengths, and weaknesses!  FOCUS ON THE STRENGTHS, and build your weaknesses up into strengths.  . . Be positive, and don't cry to potential employers.  If they were thinking of hiring you in the future, they are no longer going to.  . . GOOD LUCK -

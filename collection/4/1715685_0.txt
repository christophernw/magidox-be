Oh what I would give to have a man with a hairy chest. mmmmm. But if you insist on removing it, you can also try electrolysis. To permanently remove hair, but I think its a couple of sessions you have to go to. You might be better off waxing, its faster and not too expensive. I know women can also have their face waxed, so you can try waxing your face also. Go to a salon that specializes in that for the best results.

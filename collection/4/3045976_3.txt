There is one basic problem:  selfishness. i.e. somebody else wants what you've got if whatever you've got is worth having(and sometimes even when it's not).. . It's that way between toddlers at home or toddlers in nursery school.  It's that way all the way through school, and even into h.s and even in college where cheating for grades is just another example of somebody trying to take shortcuts to get what they don't have.. . And there are those who choose not to go to school or work so they can steal from those who do.. . Some just like to break things and hurt people.. . If we can't fix such problems on a local level, e.g. the gang-related problems in our homes, neighborhoods and cities, how can we expect to not have such problems between nations?. . You can talk all you want about differences between cultures, etc.  The basic problem remains the same:  You give me what's yours' or else:  selfishness.. . Can this problem of human nature ever be resolved?  Only on an individual level...but each individual can do a lot of good.  . . Jesus started such a selfless movement.. So they crucified Him for His effort.  . Nothing changes, does it?

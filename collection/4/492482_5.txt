Nobody aboved mentioned that the Soviet Union were poised to attack Japan in August of 1945. The United States didn't want the Soviets to attack because the Soviets would have wanted a piece of Japan and it would have been carved up till Germany was.. . The beginning of the Cold War began before the end of the Second World War. The United States wanted a quick end to the war to keep the Soviet Union out of the Asian front.. . I agree that dropping the bombs saved lots of military losses and a lot of time but incinerated 100,000's of innocent people is never justified.. . If an enemy of America denotated a bomb inside the US and killed millions, would people call that justified? Of course they wouldn't. It'd be the greatest crime in human history.

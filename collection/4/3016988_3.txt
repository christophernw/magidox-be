Both f**k and s**t have been in the English language for thousands of years.  Both words are reconstructible to Proto-Germanic, the ancestor language of all the Germanic languages, about 2500 years ago.  In Proto-Germanic, *fukan was a euphemism replacing an older vulgar word.  The euphemism was based on Proto-Indo-European *pug- 'to strike'.  Neither word was ever an acronym.

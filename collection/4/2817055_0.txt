NO, there is not. I have severe sleep apnea and frequent urination as well. But there is no relationship between the two. Just a coincidence. If you are sleeping better because of the CPAP machine, perhaps you are also losing weight, or getting into better physical condition because of having higher energy levels. If this is the case, then that would explain why less trips to the potty at nighttime.

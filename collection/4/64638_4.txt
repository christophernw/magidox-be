stevieboy is wrong, the world could end right now, in the blink of an eye, when you least accept it.. . Just know that, if you truly believe in Jesus, that he loves you, wants to help you, and paid for you with his life, you will go to heaven, but if you don't, you will be in hell for eternity.. . think about it.. where will you spend eternity?. it's your choice.

a tsunami travels at a speed that is related to the water depth - hence, as the water depth decreases, the tsunami slows.. The tsunami's energy flux, which is dependent on both its wave speed and wave height, remains nearly constant. Consequently, as the tsunami's speed diminishes as it travels into shallower water, its height grows.. Because of this shoaling effect, a tsunami, imperceptible at sea, may grow to be several meters or more in height near the coast.

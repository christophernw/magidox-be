We can't, hence the debate over truth, and if any truth besides "I think therefore I am" exists. Therefore you can't determine any true statement based on your surroundings, a true statement must not rely on any assumptions based on the world.. . By the nature of human interpretation, you can't rely on anything based upon the senses, including instrumental measurements, because you're still interpreting the results. At the same time, you can't prove that there is NOTHING outside of your consciousness, so you sort of just have to assume that to some extent there is a reality outside of yourself, because that makes more sense than the opposite at this point.. . That's my answer based on my limited understanding of philosophy.

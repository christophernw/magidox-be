Would greatly help to know the source of the chart. I am guessing your "rainfall radar" chart are estimates of rainfall which has already occurred using radar and the "forecast rain" chart is that which an algorithm forecasts based on radar trends. Both can include fairly large errors in some circumstances - especially the latter. Nothing beats the ground truth of an accurate rain gauge.

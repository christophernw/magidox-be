Apparently you didn't hear. People that watched the Daily Show were more informed on the Presidental Race then anyone else in the country. The did a test among people who watched all these shows and average americans. People on the Daily SHow kicked the crap out of everyone!!! By a big margain. The Daily SHow is very informative and alot more enjoyable to watch. They give you what you need to know and not the other stupid stuff, like birds on the loose. Every so often they ask "why was this on the news?" and show stupid stuff REAL!! news shows that don't make sense. I can't speak for the other shows. But the Daily SHow kicks the crap out of any other news show.. ........................................................ modified right here!! . . Rank: 44 of 15735 . . The Daily Show also delivered cable's best rating among 18-34 year olds and placed second only to Fox News Channel in total viewers and 18-49s, according to Comedy Central. . . Television ratings show that the program generally has 1.5 million viewers nightly, a high figure for cable television. In demographic terms, the viewership is skewed to a relatively young audience compared to "real" news shows. A 2004 Nielsen Media Research study commissioned by Comedy Central put the median age at 35.. . "THERE YA GO A HIGH FIGURE FOR CABLE TV!!!" . (thats for all the daily show haters)

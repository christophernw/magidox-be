More bleeding heart liberals, WTF?  I am glad he is dead.  And even if he did survive the bombing which is now the story, I applaud the soldiers who were there and beat the holy hell out of him, good for them, they should be given a medal.  If in fact some soldiers beat him to death, I think they saw what a  cluster f--k it is with Saddam Hussein in court, and decided there will be no more of that bull sh-t.

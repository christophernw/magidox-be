One of the reasons that states have to spend a good part of their budgets on education is because the Federal Government keeps passing unfunded mandates.  No child left behind, but the states have to pay for the program.  This is often the case; the Federal Government makes laws demanding certain actions but does not provide the funding.  This is one reason why property taxes continue to rise.

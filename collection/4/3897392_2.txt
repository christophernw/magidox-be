Nice stereo type. I am not a bubba and I vote republican. I live in the Southwest. Many people here in the southwest are republicans as well. . To each his own. We all have our own preferences. We agree and disagree with various things. Just because you don't agree with the republican party does not mean everyone else has to hate it. . . People do as they do and they have their reasons just as you have your reasons.  So respect others in what it is that they choose to do. :o)

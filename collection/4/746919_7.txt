Oh well you can certainly use the computer for MANY things.. . 1. Communications. Although it's not great communication, it beats calling long distance every day right?. 2. Research. If you have the internet you can reach all sorts of sources that you could maybe not find in your own local library.. 3. You can use a computer to type up things instead of handwriting them. Imagine hand printing a 10 page essay!. 4. Entertainment. You could use a computer as a dvd player or a cd player. Or install computer games or play the games provided for you.. 5. You could use the programs to help store information that would take a lot of space and paper.. . . Yeah well I've run out of ideas, but you get the basics. Good luck.

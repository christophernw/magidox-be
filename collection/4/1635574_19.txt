If you meant "huh" I would say just REMEMBER a nano second before you say it, and think of how bad you will look for others.. . If you meant "ahh" , remember a nano second before you blurt it out that THAT'S what you dont want to sound like when speaking in public. LET YR BRAIN REMIND YOU, our brain is usually right when telling us the very first things we think of in our mind. MAKE IT A PRIORITY in your brain not to say "ah" right before a public speech and that is what your brain will tell you right before you blurt it out.. . TRUST YOURSELF THAT YOU WILL NOT SAY IT! The rest your brain will do it for you.

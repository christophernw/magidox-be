there is no proof. if there was a god then why do most of the wars religious based? if god does live then he/she is the meanest thing in the universe. how many people were murdered because they did not believe in god. what kind of god would allow that. and if they think we are the only living beings in the universe than think again. mathematically it is impossible for us to be the only living beings. i can go to Hollywood and find a dozen people who claim to be the son of god. there is no way i am going to believe anyone that claims to be born of god.

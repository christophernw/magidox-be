Most often children are born with it....a lot of the time, from parents who thought it was okay to smoke during pregnancy.....more often from mother who suffer from second-hand smoke. you can contract it, but it is rare, and usually it is because you were born with the ability to contract it. it has a lot to do with small breathing space in your body, and because it's so small, it cuts off air intake from time to time, and it needs to be opened.. . So yeah, born that way.

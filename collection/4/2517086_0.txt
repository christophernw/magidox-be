Sadism and masochism.. . Sex play wherein one partner intentionally causes the other physical pain. It is different from B&D or bondage and discipline because the latter often only involves restraint and no more pain than a playful spanking. S&M involves actual sadistic harm to the masochistic partner who derives sexual satisfaction from being hurt and humilated.

You have entered the twilight zone. This happened to my neighbor at the beach. Mama Racoon entered tore up the heating ducks...had a litter and moved in to stay. She found out about it when some eyes were staring at her through the inside grates. The fumegator came out and set up the traps using canned cat food. The racoons didn't fall for it...it cost over 4K.... That is nothing if the skunks decide to take over...lotsa $$. The only wild animal protected is a possum.. When you get rid of them do not leave the dog's water or petfood out. Racoons can be dangerous. Good luck!

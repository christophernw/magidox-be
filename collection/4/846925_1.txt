Light never stops moving because it has the properties of a wave.  It continues in a straight line until it hits something which reflects or absorbs it.. . (It also bends slightly when it travels through a gravitational field, however, one way of thinking says that the light is not bending, rather, gravity causes space-time to warp and the light is travelling straight.). . And yes, light can travel in reverse.  Just point the flashlight the other way.  It keeps moving in whatever direction it is sent... send it the other way and it goes in reverse.

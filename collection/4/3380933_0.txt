There's the Facial Feedback Hypothesis which basically says that when you laugh naturally you use the orbicularis oculi  and zygomatic muscles (a fake laugh just uses the the zygomatic muscles). When you laugh, the muscles are stimulated and it sends feedback to you're brain where it will make a physiological change, such as produce more (or less)  neurotransmitters.

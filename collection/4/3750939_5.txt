I know that with lugnuts on car wheels the standard advice is to thumb-tighten all of them, then tighten them to full torque doing opposite bolts in pairs. With four you would do them in the order:. .  ...1. 3....4. ...2. . with five it's a star pattern like:. . ....1. 3.....4. ..5..2. . I'm not sure how one would do six but my guess would be:. . ....1. 3.....6. 5.....4. ....2. . I think the basic idea is to try to keep the wheel centered by doing nuts on opposite sides alternately.. . I suspect much the same principle would be the ideal way to tighten screws. However, I don't think it matters for most things: usually any order will do.

you know, if you just stop and think about it, there is no need to add a higher price to a product in order to pay for some Kosher mark, or kosher seal of approval. The reason is that by increasing the sales of an item, because now Jews and others who keep kosher will be buying the product, the company makes more money and that, alone pays for any costs of certifying the product as kosher. This means the price of the product to the consumer stays the same, but the company makes more money, because they can sell more of the product.

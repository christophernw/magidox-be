Why do we keep getting questions about why Americans characterize "all" of this or that as being a problem from Mexicans?  Show me ONE American post that blamed ALL the drug problems on Mexicans?. . Drugs are one of those things where people are being saved from themselves, so the fact that there is complicity in the protected class doesn't make it right.  . . In this case, my concern is children, although the drug runners tend to be a much more unsavory type than those who use drugs recreationally, as well.  Keeping out unsavory types, generally, is a good idea.  Also, the point is that we have a right to regulate what trade comes across the border, as a nation.  We don't approve that trade.  However, the question is ridiculous since no one blames Mexicans for "all" the drug problems.

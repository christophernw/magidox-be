The meaning of the word gnostic is Greek for "knowledge" or "to know".. . It was a group of people who claimed that had "secret" knowlege about Jesus that no one else had. Hence many new "gospels". Those who hold to books other than or included with a Bible is gnostic because of their "extra information".

I drink a lot of coffee if I am particulary stressed, I dont think it is good.. . The abuse of alcohol is worse because it messes up you mind - you wont become like Ozzy Osbourne, but thats where you are headed.. . Its not pathetic, its an escapism, yopu need to find another way to deal with your emotions.

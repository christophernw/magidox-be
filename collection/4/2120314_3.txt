I know this might sound contrite - but one person at a time.  The Bible teaches us that the poor we will always have among us - there is no ending that until we are all done living on this planet.  We can only help those who are in "world" and teach others to be responsive to the needs of the poor.  I teach middle school and you'd be surprised at how few of them have been taught to SHARE what they have, to give instead of always expecting something, to surrender a gift of their own to some child, to pick an angel from the Angel tree and help some needy child - they don't see their own parents do it, so we are raising a generation of children who don't feel the need to share and give to others.  Our hearts have to change and become tender to the needs of others.  We have to stop being so self-centered and greedy.  We are all guilty and this is not the season to do it and stop - we should be giving all the time.

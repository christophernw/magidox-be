My daughter is 10 weeks and for the last 3 weeks I have been walking 30-60 mins a day plus lots of crunches and sit ups (I use an exercise ball) and I am seeing a little change, but any change for the good is enough for me to continue exercising! I am trying to be patient and persistent and I am sure it will pay off!

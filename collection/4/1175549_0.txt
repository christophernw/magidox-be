the past is that.....past.... you need to let go of your guilt...there is no answer we can give you, that you haven't already explored yourself..... you don't need an answer.....you need forgiveness,....and only YOU can give that to yourself.. Judge not.... that even includes ourselves.... you did what you did...no BFD....and you will find no comfort in the FACT that others have done worse...hold tight to all the good memories during that time..and let go of the rest..  MOVE ON girlfriend!!! the future is bright..!!! just turn the light ON!!

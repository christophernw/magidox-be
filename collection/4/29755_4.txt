Putting yourself in the customers shoes at all times, empathy.  You have been a customer in a situation where the customer service has been horrible I'm sure, esp. since customer service even by some of the biggest & best co.'s out there seems to be last on their list.  Go the extra mile, all it will cost you is an extra 15 or 30 min.  Don't pass the buck by saying it's some other dept.'s problem.  Step up & handle it the way you would want it to be handled if you were in their shoes.  But also let them know that there's only so much you can do at your level also, you aren't a miracle worker.  Professionalism & being able to speak english is a plus too!!

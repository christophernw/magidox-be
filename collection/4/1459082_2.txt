I think its a very cool job!  But you need to get your education to become a law enforcement officer before you can even get on with the dept. Then, I would think you have to serve in other positions before being just assigned an "undercover" position.  I don't know about how quickly you could become undercover, though. I guess it would depend on you, your contacts, and the department in which you would like to work.. . Good luck!  It is a very admirable job!

the bible speaks about Jesus performing miracles to prove who he is..giving the gift of miracles etc...so that they may believe....if things weren't answered, if nothing ever happened how would you believe God was really there..then i think he'd be made up in your mind..because nothings happening, what would you be having faith for?

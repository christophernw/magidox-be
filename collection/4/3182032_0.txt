It's been a topic of discussion for many years...most women are just built wrong down there.  The clit should have been placed closer to the opening and there are some doctors that have tried surgery to improve on this.  A clitoral orgasm is comparable to a man's ejaculation and if you've never had one, you're really missing out.  Vaginal orgasms are milder and more frequent but if you want that 100% one that makes you call for time out, use clitoral stimulation.

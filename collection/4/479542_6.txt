Satan is bad because he chose to be so when he disobeyed God's instructions, and he decided not to be the only bad one by tempting us, humanbeings of doing bad and horrible things that make God angry with us. In all religins Satan is considered bad and following his way will make the man doomed and away from God's mercy and peace.

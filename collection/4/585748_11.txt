There are a lot of causes to homelessness. Some people are victims of unfortunate choices - gambling, debt, drugs, alcohol. . . Some people are victims of unfortunate circumstances, unemployment, mental illness, etc. . . And there is a small subset of the homeless population that chooses, for whatever reason, to be homeless. And I say this, because I met a homeless man who holds a PhD. He was a professor. He decided that he didn't want to be tied down to a house. . . Unfortunately, there is no real magic pill solution to homelessness - we need better social services - not just "free checks," but REAL services - to help at-risk families get themselves stable financially, whether it's through job skills training, lessons in money management, addiction treatment, etc.  We need better case management with mental health clients to make sure they are taking their medications, and that the necessary medications are available and affordable to the clients. A lot of these clients have fallen through the cracks of the existing system - to help prevent, we need to start there.

With the teens' questions and some of their responses to questions, I am quite concerned with this generation.  I'm afraid this generation has had to raise themselves because of absentee parents who either choose to not be present in the home or who have made decisions that require they not be in the home.. . I guess I feel as if my parents felt about the 60s generation.. . We can only hope!

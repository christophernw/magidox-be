I don't know, but I've heard that if the mother smoked when she is pregnant, that could cause LD. My son has LD's and my mom found a book that said that. What's weird though, the same book said that the person with LD, if they smoke, and you try to make them quit, it makes things worse, cause smoking relaxes them.. . I'm not recommending anything. Just repeating what the book said.

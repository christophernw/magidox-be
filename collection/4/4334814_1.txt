Kennedy did not call himself a type of wiener, that person doesn't even have his myths right. The myth is that he called himself a jelly donut, 'ein Berliner'. But Berlin doesn't even sell those types of donuts, it's primarily in the south. The crowd didn't laugh at him at all, maybe someone needs to listen to an actually recording?

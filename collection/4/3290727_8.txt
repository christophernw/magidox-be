Spray her with water.  Do you have an empty spray bottle?  Fill it with water and everytime she goes near your furniture - spray her.  She'll associate the leather with water and eventually learn that if she doesn't want to get wet, she'll stay away from it. Also buy scratch posts and tell her/pet her what a good girl she is when she uses it.

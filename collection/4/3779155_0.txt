The "interstate" designation is given to highways and freeways that are mostly funded by the federal government's money (as opposed to state built and operated highways and freeways). It has nothing to do with whether they actually go to other states or not.. . After all, the "branch" interstates (I-110, I-405, I-280, etc.) in major urban areas almost never extends beyond their state of origin.

Sounds like a panic attack, which is caused by stress.  Probably just overloaded at work, either temporarily or chronically.  Talk to a psychologist.  Maybe you need a vacation or reassignment for a while.. . If you are having panic attacks, don't get too concerned about them.  They are unpleasant, but pass in a few minutes.  They can be treated quite effectively.  I have had many, many of them.. . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_Attacks

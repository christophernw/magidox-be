If it's easy, you won't make much money. You have to work hard for it. Doing well in school. Going to college. Getting great grades. Participating in extra-curricular activities, doing good community service. All this will look good on your resume which will get you an entry level job. Then you'll have to continue to work hard to get advancements and pay raises. Eventually you will make a good salary. See. . . it's not EASY!

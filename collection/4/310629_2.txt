First Person Shooter. It refers to the point of view the player will experience. First person means you see what the character would see. Example would be Doom and Quake. Third person shooters are pretty popular too. This is when the camera "follows" the character. Since Grand Theft Auto 3, those games have had the option of being either first or third person. But thats generally the meaning.

I have this for you... Why does it matter? . Does fat Americans bother you? Do they sit at your door step eater their cheeseburgers and fries? I highly doubt it, so why in the least should you care? . I'm a very happy American, not fat, but if I were fat. By golly that's my business and not yours. For Christ sakes you live on the other side of the world. Get over it. If I want to ride around in my gas hog of an SUV and eat McDonald's all day long and then drive 10 feet, because its to far to walk, then by damn it I'm going to. But why the hell should you care what I do? Or any American for that matter. I don't criticize you for everything you and your like do.

I agree with bull dog. You have to enjoy the job field that you're in. For example, I'm studying to be an accountant, so there's no way in hell I would ever get a job in journalism... I would never have a good attitude at a job like that even on a good day. If you're stuck at your job and can't find a new one right away, just tell yourself that you're paying the bills even though the way you're doing it is not that great. Also, it could always be worse... look on the positive side.

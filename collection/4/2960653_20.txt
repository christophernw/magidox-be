you are silly aren't you? i personally love christmas. I don't see where my tax dollars need to pay for government decorating for it when the government is always so hard-up for money!. So i also see people who aren't religious view point of why they shouldn't be forced to pay for them in support of a religious holiday they don't believe in!. . you know, if the government quit paying for christams decorations, maybe those tax$$ could be refunded to the tax payer huh?? there is your republican tax cuts, without cutting anything that helps people!. . the question that really needs to be asked, is why people like you think you are conservative, while at the same time feel the need to force your views on everyone else!

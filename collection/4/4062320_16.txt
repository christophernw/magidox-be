Sometimes masturbating takes away the desire of a woman. In other words if you are doing that all the time and you know what you like it becomes so habit forming that a womwn can't match what you do yourself as far as satisfying yourself. It's the same with women. They can take care of what their body wants and a man can't always do that. So, they say to stop for a while and see how it goes. that's a personal choice. Either you want a relationship and to have and enjoy sex with hwe or you just take care of yourself. So what!

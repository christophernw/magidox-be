I have three indoor cats... the absolute best thing that I have found for that (and to keep them out of the real Christmas trees and plants) is to keep a squirt gun handy and anytime you see them go anywhere NEAR the area, just give them a quick squirt.  It's totally harmless but it makes them think that they'll get a little 'surprise' if they go near the couch.  Plus, it's hilarious to watch.  lol . . please give it a try!  it worked for us!

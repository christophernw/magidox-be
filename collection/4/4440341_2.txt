I work in collections.  I have 7 filing cabinets full of promissory notes, most of which have co-signers.  We sue the co-signers.  Explain to your 'friend' that you simply cannot compromise your own financial situation by co-signing for him.  Creditors will treat your signature the same as the first signature, and will sue both of you when he stops paying. and my friend, they always stop paying if there is a co-signer.  Tell him to forget the bank and go to a local credit union.  Credit unions have less stringent requirements for such small loans; they would probably let him sign a note for an unsecured signature loan without requiring a co-signer.  Give him this advice and wish him luck, but don't let him guilt you into signing. You've already made the correct decision to not sign; you need to stick by your guns on this.

My cat does the same thing. I've heard that it's an action left over from kittenhood. Kittens would knead their paws to stimulate the mother to give her milk. I'm assuming they knead soft things like blankets and pillows because it feels like their mother's belly. It's a behavior (like purring) that symbolizes a contented cat.

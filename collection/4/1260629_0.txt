Before getting a French citizenship, you need to get a work visa.  The normal way of doing this is finding a French company that wants to hire you and have them fill out the paper work.  This, of course, means you need to have some skill that the French employer is looking for that he can't find in France as cheaply as he can hire you.. . After you have a work visa and live in France, it is a many year process to actually be able to apply for citizenship.

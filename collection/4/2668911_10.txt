NO there is NOT. . and the consequences of letting your body clear it can be devastating.  There is a protein in your body that looks exactly like strep..... so when your body revvs up to take on the strep, it takes on YOUR HEART.. . Rheumatic fever, kidney problems, scarlet fever.. . Not worth it, go see the doc.  It's 2006 for goodness sakes.

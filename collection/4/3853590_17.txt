I've found at least as many posts against Christianity of Islam, which, including Judaism, make up the biggest religions basically. I think it's just because they're common religions, and there will always be debate between religions and between religious people and non-religious people. Don't take it as as personal offence. I don't belong to any religion and many religious people are "against" me/us as well :-P

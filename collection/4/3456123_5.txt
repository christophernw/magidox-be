Man made all the gods. There is so much that we are still just learning about physics and cosmology that the Big Bang theory will continue to be adapted to new realities as they are discovered. It's just a theory, and as such must be flexible and allow for errors, new data, and stuff. I only wish the Anthropology and Archeology communities were as open and flexible about new finds as the Cosmology scientists are. . Maybe all the matter existed in the 'strings' or pockets of Dark Matter. Maybe that was the result of an earlier universe collapsing upon itself. The pockets got so full and so condensed that they 'broke' and exploded back out, everywhere all at once. Or cascaded. It's all just conjecture at this point. The nature of the Universe is something that I doubt we know enough about to say anything about it's 'beginning' or 'ending' with anything close to certainty. It makes more sense than an omnipotent being, who only likes the Hebrews, creating everything only to destroy it and torture it's inhabitants someday.

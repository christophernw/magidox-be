Higher interest rate say in Japan(lol) than the U.S. would cause a demand shift for Yen over dollars. The value of Yen would rise, and the dollar would fall. U.S. goods would then become cheeper for Japaneese citizens than previously were, and Japaneese good would be more expensive for U.S. citizens. Japan would import more from the U.S. and export less, the U.S. would export more and import less from Japan.

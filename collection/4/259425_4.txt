as we get closer to the summer time, although the earth is a little bit farther away from the sun, the earth changes its angle about its axis.. this causes the sun rays to hit our area, mainly the US at a more direct angle. that is, the angle of incidence is less. which causes a more intense sun ray to penetrate through the ozone later. if the angle of incidence is higher, that would make the sun rays come in lower, which means more light would reflect away than penetrate. this can be explained via snell's law of reflection. more intense bean of light, more energy passing through to the surface of the earth. . Not to mention what it does to the ocean water, where our weather really comes from..

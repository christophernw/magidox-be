it just comes NATURALLY - if you are Bipolar-disorder. but watch out - the highs, can ALL OF A SUDDEN FALL to the bottom---DEPRESSION CAN SET IN ------OR  BURN-OUT - IF YOU ARE NOT BIPOLAR (MANIC-DEPRESSION);   ----    IF YOU BECOME OBSESSED WITH WHAT YOU ARE DOING --ARE VERY INTERESTED IN IT--THEN YOU CAN  STUDY  17-18 HRS. A DAY; BUT I DON't recommend it;  that's too much and you will run u r  self down.

They are meteorites that have come into the Earth atmosphere and light up because of the friction that they have with the Earthâ€™s atmosphere.  They do not always fall to the ground though, some times they skip off the atmosphere like a flat stone skips off of a body of water when thrown correctly, other times it burns up before it reaches the ground.

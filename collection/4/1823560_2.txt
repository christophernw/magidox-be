As a teacher, I use a computer pretty much constantly.  I use word processing to make up worksheets and tests, as well as composing.  I also sometimes use PowerPoint to present notes.  I do a lot of research on the internet, and I have students use the internet for class projects.  My school has a recordkeeping program that I use to keep track of grades and to send attendance to the office each period.  I use e-mail to communicate with parents and sometimes with students as well as to send messages to and from the office.  I am also responsible for maintaing our school website, so I have special software on my computer for that purpose.  Finally, I see keeping up with technology as a necessity for today's teachers.  It is important that we understand the technology that our students are using.

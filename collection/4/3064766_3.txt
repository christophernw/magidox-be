Well the first step is realizing that there is something in your life that you are in denial about...obvious i know.  . . once you've come to terms with the fact there you have certain things that need working on...you can begin to deal with them!. . Try writing down your feelings exactly as they pop into your head.  Then put your journal or word.doc aside for a few days and let these ideas marinate in your brain then come back and read what you've written.. . now, try organizing these thoughts and feelings.  why do you think you feel the way you do?  are you blaming yourself for something that you shouldn't...or are you not accepting blame when maybe you should?  write down the facts related to your denial issues, while trying your hardest to be objective and rational.  . . compare how you feel with the facts and how you think your situation actually is...hopefully you will be able to slowly being changing your additude after you review the situation.. . if this is too frustrating...that's cool!  part of being a mature person is knowing when to ask for a little guidance.  if there is someone you can trust, ask him/her is you can chat over a sundae and confide your feelings.  this person can be more objective than you.  . . if there is no one in your life right now who you trust to confide in, seek a school counselor, or if you have the means, a professional is something to consider.. . best of luck, and i hope i've help you a little - and you're definately on the right track to freeing yourself from denial by coming to terms w/ the fact that you're in denial in the first place!!

Dogs are the opposite; they leave their poop out there for other dogs to find. Dogs love to walk around and smell what other dogs have left.

There are several solutions to this: 1)Cleaning the turds out three or four times a day and figuring out what time your cat(s) usually go. 2) Using a covered cat box your dog can't get in, but if he's a pomeranian or something that will be hard. 3)Use a child gate to keep your dog out of the litter box area.

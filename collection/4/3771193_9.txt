I'm not sure why you associate working at home with lazy?. I work just as hard as you or anyone else, I just think differently than you do.. I do not understand why you think you need a legitimate excuse not to work at home.. Can you give me a legitimate excuse for subscribing to the 45 year plan where you start a career at 20 years old and work until you are 65 for someone else?  So you spend your life working to make someone else rich?  And then most retire with nothing and depend on the government to support them through their golden years.  Most have never heard of leverage or residual income, both of which are necessary to see you comfortably through retirement.  I think THAT is the lazy way.  You never have to take the time to learn about finances, you just accept that that's the way it is done.. . I choose to work smart.  I still work as hard as anyone else but I get paid in direct proportion to my efforts, not what some boss with no qualifications thinks I deserve.  . I take holidays if and when I please and am secure knowing my business will keep thriving even when I'm not there.  If there is any doubt, I take my computer with me and work from which ever beach I happen to be visiting.  . I have no cap on my salary and never have to ask for a raise just to pay the bills.  My bills are always paid.  . . Some people are natural born entrepreneurs, others learn how to manage their lives wisely which starts with working for yourself.. . It's sad that you think of that as lazy, but always remember, the people that you listen to in this world are that ones that you will end up like.

Insurance companies are not ripping people off, only Allstate and Farm Bureau are. Most of the damage to the Gulf Coast was indeed caused by wind, I agree. However, alot of the damage slightly inland was caused by flood, and not coverable without flood insurance. Flood insurance is sponsored solely by the Federal Government (NFIP), and administered by the private insurance companies on the government's behalf. Because it's sponsored by the government, there are alot of rules and red tape to go through. I suggest you get State Farm, they're about the easiest to get along with from a homeowner's standpoint. And make sure you get flood insurance. An Independent CAT Claims Adjuster.

i dont think the issue is that he still talks about his wife, that passed but that his daughter acts out or what ever it is that she does. and yes a child should seek a professional after the death of thier mother, possibly the father too. just talk to him about it, not confrontational at all, just lightly bring it up, and not in front of the daughter

I think that's a minority of Americans who are extreme enough to believe such a thing. However it is true that a proficient ability to speak a second language is rare among Americans who speak English at home. It's not fear so much as not wanting to take the effort - they can get by most places with English, so they do.. . But what you say may, unfortunately given the political climate at the moment, be perceived as more true of Spanish as a second language than other languages.

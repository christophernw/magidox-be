I'm sure that you are aware that the House and Senate have numerous rules regarding the organization of partisan politics and the resulting necessity for majority and minority leaders within the respective two-party structure.. . So, from there, the question of why don't John Boehner and Bill Frist represent the majority of Americans is really more of a phenomenon of their party's inner workings. . . I'm not sure how much more seriously you would like to approach the issue of the prevalence of white, straight, christian men in politics, and in particular, political power.

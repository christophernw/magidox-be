Hey Mr Holier Than Though! . Jesus drank wine... and you cant tell me he didn't drink a little too much every once in awhile.  He had to make water into wine for a wedding.  what about communion.. or do you use grape juice? puhleez!. . . Uncle SAM makes too much money by taxing alcohol and tobacco.  . We need to start taxing churches IMMEDIATELY.. they are getting too big and out of control.. . moron!

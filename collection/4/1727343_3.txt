Typically, one nostril is slightly wet and congested while the other allows air to flow freely. Odors are carried by small and large particles. We smell odors when the particles disolve into the wet membranes inside the nostrils. The small particles are smelled by the free flowing nostril in which air moves quickly and spreads lots of small particles over a large area. The large particles are smelled by the wetter more congested nostril in which the large particles disolve slowly but completely in the wetter membranes.

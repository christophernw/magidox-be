Protestant has come to mean one of the three major branches of Christianity; Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. So, if one is not a Catholic or Orthodox, one is a member of a protestant group. This system is convenient, but not entirely accurate.. . The churches that were formed 500 years ago at the time of the protestant Reformation are the ones that are most truly "protestant." These would include the Lutheran churches, the Reformed churches, the Anglican churches (Church of England) and the Presbyterians, who can be considered part of the Reformed movement. Churches that were formed later, such as the Methodist churches about 250 years ago, are still considered protestant for all intents and purposes, though.

It proves what all politicians think about the American electorate ... they don't seem to think that the American voter understands policy issues, but are only interested in scandal, gossip and sound bytes ... in other words, the politicians of both parties seem to think that Americans by and large are stupid, ill educated and unable to make decisions based on policy ... sad, isn't it, that our elected representatives of both persuasions think it's OK to win by stooping so low ...

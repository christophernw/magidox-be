Well it's great for navigation, timing your track over the ground for calculating ground speed. Also for timing of turns. A standard rate turn takes two minutes to complete a full 360 degrees. So if I wanted to turn around & do a full 180, I would turn at a standard rate for 1 minute & when I rolled out of the turn I would have changed direction by a full 180 degrees, & I would have used my chronograph to time the turn.

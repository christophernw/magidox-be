I agree with you to a point!...you call them trolls, and that's fine because that's the way you see them , but GOD calls it something else in (Matt. 7: 6).....for the 5% few that really want God, spiritual encouragment, and spiritual ensight, I guess it's worth it to a point!.....but yes, I think true believers should not answer filthy, abusive, condemning, judgmental, insulting, and disrespectful questions from God Haters of Non-believers, just let them stay with their own kind!......good luck!

Citric acid (the acid found in lemons that gives it that puckering-up taste) can be bought at any health food store or a good grocery store for cheap.. . It goes under the name of soursalt. Sometimes you'll just see it as "citric acid crystals".. . The way it is produced industrially is by bacterial fermentation.

Easter originally had nothing to do with Jesus. It was a day chosen by an evil man to tack the Resurrection of Jesus on so that people would join the church and they could still celebrate their pagan holiday. The true day of Jesus Resurrection can and should be honored, but we must find out the Feast of Passover and Unleavened Bread. Jesus died on the Passover, and three days and three nights later Rose Again.  Lets us get back to the truth, and Honor Jesus Resurrection the correct day.

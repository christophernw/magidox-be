In January 2005, the Daewoo brand was replaced across the whole of Europe by General Motors' global value brand Chevrolet. One of the biggest names in motoring, Chevrolet has been building and selling high quality, charismatic cars offering great value for money around the world since 1911. Although the name started in the USA, Chevrolets are now sold in over 90 countries. . . What does this change mean? It means that the Daewoo Matiz, the Daewoo Kalos, the Daewoo Lacetti, the Daewoo Tacuma, the Daewoo Lanos, the Daewoo Nubira and the Daewoo Leganza are no more. . . However, the good news is that their enduring quality and value are reflected in the current range, with the added attraction of that great name - Chevrolet. There's the all-new Chevrolet Matiz, which combines cheeky looks with about-town practicality. Then there's the slightly larger, but no less stylish Chevrolet Kalos, the family-sized Chevrolet Lacetti, a three body style range in itself, and our really practical MPV, the Chevrolet Tacuma. . .

I have never used debt consolidation before-but I do know this. Only use a debt consolidation service if you absolutely HAVE to. It's a really bad mark on your credit history, almost as bad as bankruptcy! So, unless you are completely and utterly in debt with no chance of recovery on your own-don't call a debt consolidator. Try calling your individual credit collectors first; often times they are willing to work with you through hard times!

I commend you on all the education and knowledge you have under your belt!. . My suggestions:.  - decide on which area of interest/expertise you'd like to teach in..  - you may have to get some teaching experience and /or a teaching license depending on the laws in your state..  - you may have to get a doctorate degree, again, depending on what you teach..  - you may be able to teach some college classes at a junior college or even some adult ed classes through a college. . . The first thing I would do is find out if you can teach or how to get a license to teach.. . good luck!

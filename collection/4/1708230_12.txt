Who says it is...most suicides are not intentional, but I believe if you are truly mentally challenged or in severe pain God knows your heart, why would God call it a sin because you couldn't bear this world anymort and you wanted to come see him, but remember ther is no coming back, when you are gone you are... gone...Life is a precious GIFT!!!!

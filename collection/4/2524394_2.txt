There is a float in your gas tank.   It probably gets stuck, and sometimes is shaken loose when driving. . . I always use the TRIP odometer as a backup.  Every time I buy gas, I fill the tank, and reset the odometer.  I know that my car can go 300 miles from fill-up, so I will never run out of gas. . . I did have a car, where the gas gauge always read high.  Again, I used the odometer to tell me when to get gas.   But I always assumed that I could go 320 miles with that car on a tank full.   But that turned out to be too close.   Twice, while I owned that car, I pulled into the gas station, just as it ran out of gas.  In both case, the car rolled right up to the pump.

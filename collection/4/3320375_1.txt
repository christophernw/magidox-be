you can go against the grain and you get less skin irritation. . . IMO, you get a closer shave with a good electric shaver because of these reasons.  I used to shave with a Gilette M3 Power in the shower and just switched to a Braun electric shaver.  I never thought you could get as close as shaving in the shower, but I was wrong.  The electric ones really have improved a lot in the past couple years (I tested them a few years ago and wasn't convinced).  I don't think I'll go back to a regular blade ever again.

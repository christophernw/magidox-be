A pimiento, also spelled pimento, is a small sweet red pepper, similar to, but more flavorful than, a bell pepper. It is the fruit of the Capsicum annuum, and has a tougher skin than a bell pepper. When used fresh, the skin is typically removed -- one old-fashioned method was to hold the pimiento on a long fork over a fire to char the skin, which would then easily pull off. Pimiento is more familiar to Americans as the square red strip that is found inside most brands of seedless olives; it is the 'stuffing' in the 'stuffed olive'. It is not clear when olives were first stuffed with pimiento.

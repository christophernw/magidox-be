I assume you mean the “don’t covet…” commandment?. . I take it to mean that I need to be content with what I have and not envy what God has allowed others to have – whether it is a physical possession, or a spouse, or a child, or a job, or some other thing I might become bitter about or feel tempted to try to “take” from them.. . Contentment, though, is the key principle: I need to accept what God has allowed me to have and not base my happiness on what others have that I do not. Harboring such attitudes will sour my spirit and eventually lead me to violate my neighbor in some way.

get involved in your church.. but mostly, set an example for younger kids.. if you live for jesus you'll be the brightest person in the room and all the kids younger than you will idolize you and want to be like you, so they'll grow up to serve jesus. . i know that's how it works because that's what happened to me, and to this day i still strongly remember the person that influenced me the most. she always took me out for ice cream when she saw i was hurting, and she always had a smile on her face. she worshipped every chance she got and she loved to talk about jesus and read her bible. she was my hero.

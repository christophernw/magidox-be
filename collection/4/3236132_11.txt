Sure I have met people that say they are prophets. They are all false prophets or prophets of Satan. God's Word is complete nothing can be added or take away. There has been no prophets on the earth since the last book in the Bible was complete. 2 Corinthians 11: 13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 2 Corinthians 11: 14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 2 Corinthians 11: 15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.

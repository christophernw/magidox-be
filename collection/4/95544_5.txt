Salvation that comes from trusting Christ--which is the message we preach--is already within easy reach. In fact, the Scriptures say, "The message is close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart.". . For if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by confessing with your mouth that you are saved.. Romans 10:8-10 (NLT). . . . After you've received Salvation, ask for guidance from God to learn how to live a life that pleases Him. Here's another Scripture to help you out:. . . "But we are looking forward to the new heavens and new earth he has promised, a world where everyone is right with God.. . And so, dear friends, while you are waiting for these things to happen, make every effort to live a pure and blameless life. And be at peace with God.". 2 Peter 3:13-14 (NLT). . . . Also...find a church that will teach you how to apply the Word (the Bible) to your life. This will also help you live to please God.

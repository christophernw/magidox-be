What I think you are trying to say is, How would a spaceship move in order to stimulate earth gravity on board?. . I will look more information later, yet hear is what I have heard on TV.. . The ship would spin causing everything to stick to inner wall. Just like in a dryer, when it spins the cloths our forced to the tub of the dryer. I hopes this helps. I will try to look up websites about what I am talking about later.

You poor thing - I am so sorry for your loss.. . God doesn't kill people. We have free will. Also, you have to remember that death is not the end for her.  Remember too, that the only way for you to experience such pain from her death is for you to have been granted tremendous joy from her life.  Part of the wonder of humanity is the depth of our love and emotion.. . Remember her and celebrate her life.

First of all anyone that is tasered is usually someone so high or strung out that they are trying to run.  If they had not broken the law to begin with they wouldn't be in the situation to get tasered. No one ever dies from the taser. They die from taking so many drugs that their bodies can not handle the shock. Officers are out there putting their lives on the line all the time and people think they can just go around breaking law. Trust me, I know officers and they are not bad people, they are the ones keeping bad people off the street as much as they can. If you ask me scum that they have to deal with, taser is going easy on them. So what if we lose a few here and there. That  is that much less scum on the street. It isn't like it is some grandma or nun that they are arresting. It is some low life.

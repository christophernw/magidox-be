you are refuring to cathlic preists they thae a vow to marry the church and the church then becomes their famly but there are other priests as well who get their gidence from the holy sprit who go as an ordanary man who can marry but do gods work in secret, they pray and and proficy in secret and tell no one of thir presthood the hael the sick and preform mericals but they are alowed to do more for god becouse of this you may look at one of these and never know it for they may be your clerck at the grocery store the bum on the street or any one any where and the tell no one of the work they do. a high priest ordaned by god it is between god and him and no one else knows it is sacred and no one would belive it anyway but god does work in mysterious ways.

Here are two exercises I highly recommend: . . 1. Plie Toe Squats: Stand with your feet wider than shoulder length and your toes turned out. Squat down and stick your butt out while simultaneously rising up on your toes. Do 15 to 20 repetitions. This exercise is sure to blast your inner thighs and your gluteus. . . 2. Sumo Lunges with Side Kicks: Start by standing with your feet slightly wider than shoulder width, your knees bent, your weight on your heels and your hands on your hips. Take a large step sideways with your right leg, bringing your knee to your chest and then over to the left in one continuous motion. Do 10 to 15 repetitions and repeat on the left side.

WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE!!!  (Sorry not you the other answers) You never want to yell or hit a dog for going to the bathroom in the house.  You can only yell NO when you catch the dog in the act of peeing or pooping to make it stop.  Then immediately take her outside.  When she finishes her business give her tons of praise.  Clap, sing, look like a happy fool and make her happy.  Give her a treat.  Do this every time she does her business outside.. . If she goes inside and you don't catch her, it's too late, you loose.  Don't rub her nose in it or swat her for it.  Your only teaching her that pottying is bad.  Dogs don't reason.  She can't associate that you are telling her bad for going in the house.  So now that you've taught her that pottying is bad, she won't want to do it while your outside watching.  She'll wait until you bring her in and she can run off and hide to pee.  . . FYI Terriers are sensitive.  They have a hard time adjusting to new surroundings, so even if she was house broken, she may require more work.  Also, some terriers never stop going in the house.  If shes small have you considered a litter box for dogs?. . And if you can't handle her, it may be best for you to find a family that can work with her.  Are  you taking her out enough?

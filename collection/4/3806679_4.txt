The sun glasses are coated with a film that filters out the Sun's ultraviolet rays and prevents them from reaching and damaging the eyes.. A must-have feature for all sunglasses is complete (100 percent) protection against the potentially damaging effects of the sun's ultraviolet-A and ultraviolet-B rays. Avoid buying dark sunglasses that do not offer 100 percent UV protection. Dark glasses prompt the pupil of the eye to dilate (enlarge), allowing UV rays to enter. So, if dark glasses lack complete UV protection, they can promote damage to the eye.

Everyone here has mixed opinnions and so do I.So it comes down to this.... Do you want your Betta to be skinny, dull, lethargic, and sickly? Or do you want him to be vibrant, energetic, and  healthy?. . For optimum Betta health you should feed your fish a high quality flake or pellet food 2x daily, the amount he can consume in aout a minute (4-5 pellets, or 7-8 small enough flakes that they can fit into the Bettas mouth easily).. . Followed by a supplimental (2-3x a week)feeding of frozen, freeze dried, or live foods. These foods are similar to what Bettas would eat in the wild, and provide high concentrations of vitamins and nutrients. examples:. a.) blood worms. b.) daphnia. c.) brine shrimp. d.) black worms . With proper care in making sure that you do not over feed your Betta, and Proper weekly tank/bowl maintanence you fish will live to the fullest and healthiest extent of its life.. . For bowls/tanks under 1 gallon:. 1.) stir gravel to lift up debris, OR and Only, if you have glass beads, remove and rinse the glass since there isn't enough helpfull bacteria on them anyway.. 2.) remove 1/2 the water.. For Bowls, and Tanks over 1 gallon:. 1.) stir gravel to remove debris, if you have just glass beads at this point get rid of them because they trap more trouble than they are worth (i.e. you have to completely drain and rinse the tank every time you clean).. 2.) remove 1/4 of the water weekly, and 1/2 the water monthly.

Do it in writing...and send to the manager. Just write what you have here but shorten it and leave out the A** kissing bit. You might get a voucher...or your cash. Good luck. Normally we would say to customers to wait til the end of the night until we did the tills. But if the staff can't count anyway who's to say the till roll will match the cash!. PS do it on the comp so you have a dated copy.

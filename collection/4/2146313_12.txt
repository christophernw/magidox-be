I mean what i say--what i say may not be what i completely mean --'get lost'!may mean what i say to u--but what i mean is go out of my sight,without being lost!This means i know what i am saying and conveying to u in best possible ways--but maybe my saying it in a confined way may not entirely mean what i want to say!

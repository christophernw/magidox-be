i was the same way. i was so nervous starting highschool my freshman year. esepecially in a public school where you hear about people with guns, drugs, and condoms. my first day of school was the worst. i didn't know anybody. i didn't know where my locker was. i didn't know where the school office was. so i asked a kid walking by... he called me an @$$hole and kept walking. pretty soon i saw a guy in a suit walking around. i asked him where i could find my locker. it was the principle and he showed me to where my locker was. the second day of school went a little better. and after a week i was totally used to everything. i just finished my senior year at that school. i couldn't even start telling you the difference between then and now. everyone knows me know, the principle comes to me now whenever he sees vandalism, i have the prettiest girlfriend ever, and the best job ever, and i just graduated. highschool was awesome! i enjoyed it. hope you will too.

Very little.. The real question is what effect drug trafficking has on organized crime. The illicit drug trade has created its own criminal organizations: users, street dealers, suppliers, kingpins, cartels. And just as the Mafia/Mob did in years past, the illicit drug trade has spawned the creation of government "crime-fighting" units dedicated to a single purpose. The similarities are remarkable if you really think about it.

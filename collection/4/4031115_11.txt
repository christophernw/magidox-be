I happen to agree with a lot of what you said. Unfortunately, it's not going to stop. A lot of these people feel that they must come here to "save" us, or "convert us". I just find it laughable. They are entitled to their opinions, and so are we. We should be able to discuss them in a civilized manner. But have you noticed that when we have a response to something that they have said in this section, we are just wrong, wrong, wrong? So much for intelligent discussion!

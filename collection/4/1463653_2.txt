Large ocean liners and cargo ships are powered by steam turbines.  The steam is generated in oil-burning furnaces that contain a large bank of water-filled steel tubes leading to boilers that separate out the steam.  Turbine exhaust steam discharges to condensers that recover the "fresh water" for reuse while creating a partial vacuum that expands the steam even more providing maximum power and fuel efficiency.  Much older seagoing ships often used triple expansion steam engines that had such large pistons for the low-pressure stage (steam well expanded) that four men could play cards on the steam piston (when cooled and disassembled!).  Of course fairly large excursion ships do use very large diesel engines.  Smaller personal cruise ships often use automotive type four stroke gasoline engines.

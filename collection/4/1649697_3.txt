If your talking of British boots/shoes i believe it represents the Victoria crosses won but not sure if that right or relates to number one officers dress shoes .. . But if your talking mainly of the boots standard issue well, Ammo boots originally had 25 studs but this was reduced to 13 as a wartime economy measure. Couldn't afford the waist of metals, needed bullets and tank lol..

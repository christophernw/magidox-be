Sociology is going to give you broad-spectrum study of our society, how we look at ideas, mores, etc.  As an engineer you will be entering people's space, their domains, and it might be to your healthful benefit, depending on what part of the country you're in, to know the perspectives and values that people place upon what you are fixing to alter in some form or fashion.  The south is not going to be as open to non-traditional ideations.  The east is going to want modern but very eastern standards to be met.  The midwest is going to balk at any farmland being used up.  The west is going to want to stay within chic, upscale and/or southwestern motif.  Are you beginning to see how people and engineering, regardless of the engineering field are going to tie in together?

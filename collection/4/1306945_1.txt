Ask around and see if there is a Dalmation Rescue in your area. They find foster homes and people to adopt them. They do home visits and everything, so you can be assured that the dalmation will be placed in a good home! :) It's better than taking them to an animal shelter :(. OR, you could also put an ad in the newspaper, someone may be interested and call you or her that way! Good Luck :)

A tiny misconception here, I think :  Oxygen is not combustible. It is however an integral part of combustion. Combustion is merely a reaction in which oxygen combines with something else and energy is usually also produced in the process.. . Hydrogen is combustible. The result, in fact, is water :  2 x H2 + O2 = 2 x H2O. Thus water is just combusted, or oxidised, hydrogen.. . Water cannot be combined with oxygen to form another compound and release energy, and hence water is not combustible. If it was, water would not be the end product of hydrogen combustion.. . . And by the way, looking at some of the answers, I believe being a liquid does not affect combustion; I think there are liquids that can combust, though none comes to mind offhand. I might be inaccurate on this though.

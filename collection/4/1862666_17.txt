The Da Vinci Code is an exciting murder mystery, and imaginary tale that really is exciting because of the "what ifs."  The problem is the fact that some people are so unlearned in Biblical studies, that they think this is some sort of documentary or historical treatise, which is ludicrous.  If people want to know the truth in these matters, they should study the Bible carefully, and study the works of true scholars, such as Bart D. Ehrman, who has many books on the truth of what we know, and do not know about Mary Magdalene, etc.. . The truth is that we know so little about Mary Magdalene, that it allows the imagination to run wild.  But that makes for an exciting book/movie.. . I will see the Da Vinci Code as soon as possible, but this is just for entertainment.  I will always study the Bible and the other historical documents that shed light on the Bible.  The 2 things have very little to do with each other.  One is entertainment.  The other is scholarly research.

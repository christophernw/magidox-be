A Police Officer kills only in the absolute last resort.. While perps murder without regard.. I myself believe all life holy however one must do what is in the best/legal interest for all.. In so far as treating LEA's with greater concern/respect when they are murdered-it is that they are our first line of defense,and that someone would do them harm is indeed a great crime.

I never started but some of my friends did. I think some of them do it coz they think it makes them look grown up. My friend told me once when he was drunk that he started coz he wanted to look cool and fit in. Some teenagers start coz of pressure from friends and everyone else appears to be doing it so they get pressured to do it and wanna fit in. Some start coz there friends keep on at them to try it. Some teenagers my try it out of curiosity. I tried it once and also smoking a drug once just to see what it was like. But I didn't wanna get addicted so I just tried it once.

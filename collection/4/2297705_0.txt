The prostate expands during sex and blocks off the ability of the body to urinate at the time of erection.  It takes some time for it to shrink back to normal size.  There may also be something happening with the edge of the urethra at the opening.  If it decides to stick together, then urine leaves where it will and you can't predict as much where it will go.

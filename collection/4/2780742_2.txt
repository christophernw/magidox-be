Well, it changes depending on what tradition you believe in. In different religions there are different holidays/festivals where you are allowed to fire firecrackers. . A holiday that everyone celebrates and are allowed to use firecrackers is New Years Eve. I think that wherever you are you are allowed to fire firecrackers.

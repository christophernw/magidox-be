AWWWW...poor kitty. I would suggest taking him to the Vet, and explaining your finacial situation with the Vet. Most Vets understand and will let you make payments ( mine does.) . . Even though your cat can walk on it, doesnt mean that it is easily treateable. There can be an underlying problem that no one knows about, such as internal bleeding. Not taking your cat to the vet could mean putting your cats life in danger.. . Please take your cat to the Vet, to be on the safe side.. . Good luck!

If you're a pack rat and collect everything you see try and collect something in particular. Have a huge garage/ yard sale to get rid of the stuff you need an put a trustworthy friend in charge of it. Then leave until the sale is over, so then you are not tempted to make excuses to put stuff back into your home. Then find a hobbie of something to collect to preoccupy yourself. Also plan your shopping trips and don't go to store where you know you are going to want to buy something. Go to a store you hate, this way you'll leave the store faster and buy only what you need.I hope I helped in some way. =)

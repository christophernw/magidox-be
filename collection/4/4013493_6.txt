My understanding was that the spot just above the tail is a pleasure sensor used for mating purposes.. . Seeing that when cats (and dogs) mate the male is on the female cat's back, while mating, the male's underside rubs the top part of the female, just above the tail.. . The reaction of the tail lifting when hitting that spot is a sexual instinct where the cat lifts it's tail up, allowing access to it's ... area.. . I try to avoid rubbing my female cat in that particular spot.  I don't want to give it the wrong impression...

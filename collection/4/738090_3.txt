Well, I don't believe that society thinks homosexuality is abnormal, so what can your parents do to make you change your mind.   Sure, they can send you to a psychologist or psychiatrist as you had said.  I guess your parents can request the doctor to give you antidepressants, but you know how to get around that, don't take it.  Make a pill a day disappear, be creative or you might get caught.   There maybe times where you have to take it, but it is no big deal, but antidepressants aren't that strong as long as you stay in the 10mg-15mg range.  You get much higher than that then you might become a zombie.. . But there isn't anything that will be done to you.  I mean, you won't be put into a mentally facility for adopting "homosexuality" as your preference.. . Not really sure what to tell you.  I would say just go out and have fun.  Be yourself!  Whatever your mind wants to do, do it and you will be happy.   But just don't ever do drugs, or booze it up a lot.   . . If you decide you want to go through with being gay, then what you can do is confuse your parents.   Get some nude magazines of women, like Playboy, Hustler..... You can also get Maxim, which is a magazine that shows woman in sexual poses, but not completely nude.  If you have these magazines hidden in your bedroom and they find it, then they will think you are straight.  And, if they ever find out you are dating guys, then they will just think you are bisexual.  . . I think the main thing that scares them is, if you and your brother is gay, you won't ever have kids and your family name will disintegrate because your sister will take her husbands name if she gets married and so she can't carry on the family name, so it is up to the males of the house to carry on the family name (last name).

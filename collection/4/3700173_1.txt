you may be working out the wrong way. You're obviously building muscle, but since there is still fat you won't see anything. I would say get a fitness trainer, it may be expensive but it helps in the long run. Plus, working out, and not eating properly doesn't do anything. Eating properly is more important than working out because thats where it all starts. My friend lost 20lbs from just eating properly (NOT starving herself). A nutritionist would be a great idea if you don't know what to eat and what not to eat. Personally, I would recommend a nutritionist, more than the fitness trainer because it seems like you already know how to work out. Anyways, good luck with your diet, and i hope that helped.

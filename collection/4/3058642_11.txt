Polygamy is reserved for men, beacuse this is the man's world. However, in certain cultures, that still exist in central Africa, it is allowed to women to have more sexual partners, in order to fulfill their sexual needs and to reproduce as much fresh genetic materials as possible. . . In European culture (which is also practised in USA and Canada, as well as in the most of the "western" and "eastern" world"), a man is considered as the ruler, and thus was able to make rules that allow polygamy. Polyandry (more male partners for one woman) is condemned because of mixing blood of royalty with commons, and that was the main reason for forbidding polyandry in European culture.. . Monogamy is acceptable, because it is acustomed since the ancient times. However, neither man nor woman are monogamous beings. Polygamy originates from animals, where dominating male fertilises all females in the herd, providing strong and survivable genetic material for the rest of the herd. Aside of some birds, the humans are the only monogamous beings in the world, but it is not natural monogamy. Finally, polyandry is forbidden even in animal world, because of possibility for making an incompetent creature, that would not survive.. . This pattern is inhereted by human culture (royal families menitioned above). However, liberation of women gave them possibility to choose as many partners as they like, and that event was not liked by men, who finally got the reason to feel totaly insecure about their manhood. . . So, in spite of very liberate points of view to a polyandry, men are the ones that condemn multiplicity of partners for one woman, neglecting the simple fact that this very behavior gives them a chance to mate, if they got chosen. Polyandry is more comfortable for men, but they dislike it, because of their very narrow sights.. . LONG LIVE LIBERATED WOMEN.

Some countries still practice torture ..... Here's one:  How about we stop worrying about what people do in bed and start worrying about whether or not they are responsible, trustworthy, honest and decent.   Rather than looking at someone as a sex act, let's look at them as PEOPLE!!!. . So as a side note many ignorant homophobes will say that it is against god's will.... So why then is it common for Bonobo Chimps (our closest genetic relatives) to practice male/male, female/male, and female/female sex.  They also are the group of primates with the lowest incidence of rape.  Maybe they are all happier...... . I would rather my child be an upright, honest, intelligent, responsible person and gay than they be hetero and bigoted hatemongers who seek to injure others.. . Get a grip and get over it.  Smoking is a bigger danger to society than Gays.  two gays aren't going to give me lung cancer from second hand smoke (unless they smoke..). . I thought that this country was stolen from the natives so that we could be free from religious persecution.  Is it that we just wanted to be free to persecute others?

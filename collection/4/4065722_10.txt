As you know gas is cheaper today than it was prior to us being taken off of the gold standard (something that has been in use for 3000 years)1 Oz. then would get you 120 gal. today 1 oz will get you 200 gal. Gas is cheap if you use a standard and not something that sinks in value.. . You question should read how low will the dollar sink on the world market. It will continue to sink so long as King George runs the presses with nothing to back it up.

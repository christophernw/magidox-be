actually Jesus did advocate the killing of those who would not follow him. . . Luke 19:27 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.. . and Mohammad did indeed advocate violence against non Muslims.. . Quaran 9:5 Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. . . so the Fundy zealots of both religions have justification to carry out violence on those who don't submit to their dogmas.  however, most Fundy Christian violence is in the past because American Fundy Christians are quite comfortable and don't want to risk life in prison or the death penalty by carrying out the will of their Lord that is unlawful in our secular society.  now and then a Christian Fundy will murder an abortion doctor or a gay person but all in all they've established themselves so there is no need to commit genocide anymore.   the Muslim zealots are more dangerous, at least to the west because they're feeling quite threatened by the insertion of western ideals into their closed society.

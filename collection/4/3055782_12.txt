I never understood why people go to church 3 times a week anyway.  Especially TWICE in one day(Sunday morning/Sunday night).  I really think you could grow more as a christian by spending the time helping others (IE volunteering at a shelter, nursing home, animal rescue, etc.)  I think going to church on Sunday morning only is perfectly fine.  It makes me sick people WASTE their time just sitting their butts on the church pew and not gaining anything out of it.  I bet Alot of people who are "church-a-holics" (as I call them) probably can't even tell what the sermon was about the second they walk out the church doors. What is the point in going 3 times a week if you are "bored" b/c I know you aren't listening when your there. I think churches should as a group on Sunday nights go to an organization where people are in need and help them INSTEAD of having another service and TAKING UP ANOTHER OFFERING.  . AND HERES ANOTHER THOUGHT......... You said your bored....ok....again why go then?  Do you think you are fooling GOD?  While you may be able to fool other people by going to church 3 times a week- you can't fool GOD.  He knows you dont want to be there.  . . You need to find something that will enrich your spirituality and help you grow in the Lord -- and only you will know what that is. Pray and ask the Lord to help you find it.  Good Luck.

I guess u r asking the difference between both, wheat flour as you kow is milled wheat. Maida (also kow as baking flour....not sure thou) is actually wheat flour, but is goes through a refinement (super refined) process, which makes it fine and white. Although in this process a lot of nutritional value of the wheat flour is lost.. Hope this helps

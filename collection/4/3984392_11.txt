Well, because it helps increase education plus your mom and dad (the majority of workers out there) probably work til about 5 or 6pm when you get home at 3pm. That homework will normally act as thought you were still at school for those extra hours like you'd get if you had an actual job. In a way its preparing you for longer hours. :) Hope that makes sense.

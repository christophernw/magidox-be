Well, Anaplylactic Shock is when your airway swells shut as an allergic reaction to something (for example, if I am injected with ionized contrast dye like a CAT scan or an IVP, my throat will swell shut and I can't breathe).  Some people have this reaction to bee stings.  People with this type of severe allergy usually carry on them something called an Epi-Pen.. . (I also wear a Medic Alert bracelet so if I'm knocked out, paramedics will know NO CAT-scans)

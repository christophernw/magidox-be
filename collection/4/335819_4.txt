Homologous organs are anatomically similar and similar in embryonic origin but they may or may not perform the same function. For example, wings of bat, flapper(flipper) of whale, forelimbs of horse and hand of man. These are all made up of humerus, radio-ulna, carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges which are derived from embryonic mesoderm.But these organs are used for flying, swimming, running, and handling of tools, correspondingly.. Analogous organs are those that are anatomically dissimilar, dissimilar in embryonic origin, but they perform the same function. For example, the wings of bat and wings of insects.The wing of bat has bones derived from mesoderm, whereas the wing of insect is derived from ectoderm and is made up of cuticle.

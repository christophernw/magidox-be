The reasons for your body rejecing organs and blood cells are different, although they both have to do with receptors and cell communication.  Blood is simple.  It is simply a transfusion of cells.  Your white blood cells are not alerted as they are in the case of organ transplantation.  The reason for blood rejection is actually coagulation that occurs as a result of different blood types being mixed.  There are three different bloot types, A, B and O  B blood types have B receptors and actually have anti-A antigens and A blood types have A receptors and anti-B antigens so if they are mixed, the antigens attatch to the other blood type's receptors causing the cells to clump together and restrict blood flow.  The reason an O blood type is the universal donor is because it contains neither A nor B antigens and so is safe to transmit into another blood type.  So it is the actual red blood cells causing the rejection.  . . On the other hand, your white blood cells attack foreign organs because they recognize them as a foreign object.  There are special types of receptors on your ordinary organs that tell your white blood cells that they are supposed to be there, and therefore your cells don't attack.  There are multiple factors that control this, so it is possible to find a closer match with some receptors in common so the effect is not as severe, but unless you receive the organ from a twin, it is near impossible, so you must always be on some kind of immuno-suppressant to prevent your white blood cells from attacking the organ.

Only fat guys have breasts. But even athletic men have chests. their technically breasts, but no one says that unless they want to diss them. I know some guys with huge pecs, and we always make fun of him for his "man boobs". Their not the fat kind, though. Hes really muscular. . . Breasts on guys is just what I call "lazy evolution". Nature had no reason to take them away, and they are vital muscles, so we kep them. As for nipples, why take them away? They're not doing any harm.

I dont think that the cold weather will do anything. My neighbor has a bunch of dogs and some of the females seem to be pregnant alot and she keeps loosing puppies to parvo so they went out and rented a backo and dug up the yard and she said her vet told her to sprinkle clorox all over the new dirt and they did and they r still losing puppies so now she keeps the puppies in a special pin off the property until they r about 3 months old and then she lets them loose to run around and so far so good. She told me that once parvo is in the ground, it stays there. I hope this helps.  good luck

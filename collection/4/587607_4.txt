Ah yes, Bush fanatic are we?  Look at history, you say the dems are weak, who dropped the bomb?  Harry S Truman, Democrat!  The republicans told him not to.  They said that our marines could go take over Japan, a plan that predicted over 100,000 american deaths.  truman said no, and found a way to win without sacrificing American troops.  don't be a hater because your president can't do that.

i'm sorry but people need to read the bible not so literally.  read it with a grain of salt cuz when god created the earth in seven days, who knows how long in our time it actually took?  read it as a moral guide, not as an absolute rule book cuz some of the things in the bible really can't apply to things going on today.  . it is hitting home a little too close, i suppose.  but i don't get it either.  people make movies about things that aren't true all the time, and nobody ever said anything.  it's understandable that the jewish people would get upset over the movie passion of the christ.  it isn't understandable when they specifically say that it is actually a work of fiction and people freak out.  i think it's just because they've not really been challenged at all that now they're running scared.

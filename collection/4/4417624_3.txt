Money market funds are like savings accounts (not FDIC insured) but instead of loaning your money to other people it invests your money in short term interest bearing securities.  For example variable rate demand notes, commerical paper, repurchase agrements.  It is required by SEC regulations that the average weighted maturity of these securities be less than 60 days (give or take not sure off the top of my head).  Money market funds will always yield higher than savings accounts and you'll find the highest yielding MMKT's by going to www.bankrate.com or just sign up for the paypal mmkt.

It depends on which theory you want to believe. According to the Warren report, Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone to kill President Kennedy and Ruby acted out of rage to "prevent Mrs. Kennedy from having to go through a drawn out murder trial".. Then again, if you believe the theory that Oswald was simply a mob-hired hit man, Ruby -- who was reportedly on the fringes of the mob with his multiple Dallas strip clubs -- could have been given the job of silencing the hit man.. The conspiracy theories go on and on and each has a different relationship between Ruby and Oswald ... so it comes down to what you think really happened that day in Dallas.

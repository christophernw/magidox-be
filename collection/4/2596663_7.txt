The same reason they are reluctant to admit being gay...social stigma.  To go to therapy means you are CRAZY...Charlie Manson crazy!!!!. . When I tell people I was on antidepressants for post pardum they back off.  Some people will not speak to me anymore even though all this happened 3  years ago.. . I think its more accepted to be a man with 10 kids you don't do anything for than to be a man seeking counselling to better your life....Black people of America Wake up and start helping yourselves.. . THIS IS GENERALLY SPEAKING!!!!

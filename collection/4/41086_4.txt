Well at the moment most do. Some horses dont. if the bone in their leg isn't the main bone it can be fixed, the horse can be put in a sling so that none of its legs touch the ground. but then you have the problem of pressure sores, numb legs and also it would break a horses heart not to run around for however long the bone takes to heal.. Horses being prey animals run whenever the think that they are being stalked by a lion, tiger, etc... they still believe this evern when there in our care. So when they break there leg they only have 3 to run on. But horses being panicaholics with forget about their broken leg and run if they get a fright, causing more damage to the leg.. When i was 11 my pony broke her leg and had to be put down, so i know what a thing it is to go through.. i hope to become a vet and find a cure for broken bones.

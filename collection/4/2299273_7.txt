I appreciate your research into the subject. I believe Jesus fits all criteria you mentioned.. . I recognize you do not believe the Bible is God's Word, but I do and it holds why I think Jesus fits all that criteria. . . Mashiac Ben-Yosef:  Strangely enough Jesus' earthly father was named Joseph, but I know that does not prove a point. But Jesus suffered through his passion and death. He was rejected by his own people. He even quotes this passage as they were trying to run him out of town. There is still a nation of Israel and those that profess Judaism do still reject Jesus as the Messiah..  . Mashiach Ben-David: Jesus is described in the Gospel as being a descendant of David. Jesus is not reigning in Heaven over all the earth, including Israel. At His second coming He will raise up Jerusalem above all others and the earth will pass away and the Second Jerusalem will come.. . . . I do sincerely appreciate your question. As a Catholic I understand that the New Testament is hidden in the Old and the Old Testament is revealed in the New. I think that was St. Augustine who said that. Catholic Doctrine does include both Old and New Testament. I wish there were more space to talk with you about all the other fulfillments of prophecy that Christ fulfills.

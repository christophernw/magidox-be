JEWS?  Hey, buddy ever hear of a Muslim (besides with the usual tagline "terrorist"- 'cuz, contrary to popular belief they aren't all violent people waiting to scream Jihad at the first sign of disagreement)?  The Jews (in Isreal for example) are just as discriminatory toward the Muslims as you suggested of people being against Jews- if not worse (not all Jews- just generalizing to save typing).. . Who really cares who the supreme victim is anyway?  Why is it that after this long, we haven't already just agreed that different people will believe different things.  This is the one thought that could spell world peace for us as humans, but we can't seem to stop trying to one-up one another.

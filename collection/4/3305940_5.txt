a hard list.... there are way too many games in the top of my list... so I'll have to give you my top 3:. . Battlefield 2: very well done action, you have few enugh hitpoints that it keeps you from doing stuped stuff, but enugh to keep it from getting anoying.. . Prince of persia the sands of time: outstanding combat and story, and logicly speaking would be my favorite game, but not by much.. . Dawn of war winter assalt: amazingly well balinced! by far the best RTS on the planit. . and the console would be the PS2. soon to be the Wii, I'm sure of it :)

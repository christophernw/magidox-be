It's a stereotype.  The same reason why black people are pulled over on the street if they look like they've stolen cars.  By saying that muslims blow things up you are also stereotyping.  You have to know someone before you judge or else you'll miss out big time.  There are some blacks who are in gangs and do a lot violent things: such as drive bys and fights.  Not all black people are violent just like not all white people are racist.  Muslims don't necessarily get away with blowing things up.  Our government has just gotten off track.  Hope this answers your question.

Hmm... freaked me out! I have sinus infection due to a car accident about 6 months ago. It's still there. Even with the antibiotics... and trust me, the last thing I need is a surgery. But, I asked my doctor and they say they'll do it either from the mouth or nose!? So, I'm going to the hospital today to get a scan done to see if the infection is still there or not.. Well, good luck buddy... and take care of yourself.

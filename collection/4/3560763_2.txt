30 a night would kill you so I think you're overreacting there.. . But she'll become dependent on pills, and theres a clinic that specialises in patients who are drug dependent for sleep or any other reason.. . And dont say to a doctor shes taking 30 a night, they'll assume shes a drug addict, and she probably just wants a good nights sleep.

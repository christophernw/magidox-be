His Stomach is the Key Keep attacking his ABS then move up to his head and you should recieve a quick command to press X and continue that way . As for the building part if it in the correct spot you can counter some of the attacks, otherwise if you are not the skilled just dodge them and fly towards Jafar, This way the abuse does not last that long.. Good luck, You might also need help on Ansem Lata on!

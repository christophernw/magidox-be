I did the following to my old Cadillac and it was still glued two years later.. Purchase several spray cans of high temperature adhesive. Punch several small holes in inconspicuous spots. Insert the sprat nozzle with an extender tube into the holes. Spray lightly in every direction. Push the headliner back into place. Stay out of the sun for 12-24 hours. Voila!

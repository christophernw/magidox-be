When joining a gym, many will offer a personal training option...for example they might offer two personal training sessions with a three month membership. you can always increase your personal training sessions too. unless you have lots of money though, it may be difficult to get a personal trainer to work with you every day. i have had a personal trainer....we usually met ever two weeks to check in and change up my workout. overall, they are great for motivation...but if you are looking for motivation, you could just use a friend.

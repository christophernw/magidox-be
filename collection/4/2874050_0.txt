They do decay, but slowly, since they're protected from the elements.  The hot dry climate of Egypt helps to preserve them because the bacteria that cause decay can't grow without moisture.  Organic objects (human and animal bodies) went thru a preservaton process before being placed in the tombs--the organs were removed, packed in preserving fluids, placed in jars next to the bodies, so all that was left was skin, bones and muscle, and even these might have been treated with a preservative; and then they were all wrapped up to preserve them further.  A lot of effort went into preserving human and animal bodies, it didn't happen by accident.

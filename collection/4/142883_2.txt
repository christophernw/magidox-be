To the extent that anything is a pseudo-science, it is because someone is paying the researchers to generate useless, vague studies that at best confirm what everyone already knows. The theory is, if you never come up with anything conclusive, there's no end to the funding. In most cases, the government or a clueless charitable foundation throws away the money for us. Good science finds its own funding.

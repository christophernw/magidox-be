sorry to hear about your loss.. find out about the parents what type of diseases run in the doberman  blood/breed line. the breeders have to provide all this information. cropping the ears on a doberman should be done when they'll still under a year old.. i would also suggest to adopt a puppy since you have children - is best to socialize guard dogs with the entire family.

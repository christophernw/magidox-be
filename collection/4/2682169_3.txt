A capacitor is used to store up energy from your battery.  As your car sterio is playing at normal levels, it is not drawing on your battery too heavily.  However, when your speaker hit a portion of really heavy bass, they draw extra power from your battery.  If your battery does not have enough power to drive the speaker at that point, your bass sounds a little flat.  So by adding a capacitor, you are allowing the sterio to draw a huge charge from the capacitor at that moment rather than the battery, making your bass hit harder and your trunk to rattle louder.  Make sure you get the right size capacitor for your speakers though.  Go to Best Buy or Circuit City to get help and then order it from Crutchfield.com.

One summer I got to work in the Queensboro Zoo.  I was keeper for the Aviary.  Under a huge mesh dome there was an area that was designed to look like natural open woods.  I would go in and roam around to check for nests and record what was going on and to put out the food for the animals and birds that lived inside the dome. Once I opened the dome up for the public I was pretty much free until the end of the day when I had to go do myrounds and lock up the dome.. . I would go and help the other keepers which is how I found out that buffalo like Wonder Bread and seals like smelt best of all.  I would go into the  area and search out the deer and  help to herd them back to the enclosure where they spent the night.  I had a sick goose to care fore and let me tell you you haven't lived until you try to get a goose to take its pills.  All in all it was the very best job I ever had.

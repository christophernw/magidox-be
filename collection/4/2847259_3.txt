Very interesting question.  No there are not 57 kinds of ketchup... many years ago Heinz had a variety of products... 57.  and used that saying as a catchy advertising ploy. It really did catch on.  Since then the saying "Heinz 57 Varieties" has taken on new meanings  like a dog that has many blood lines... he is said to be "Heinz 57 Variety" or something that has a varied combination of things making up its whole... This is why they keep that now vary valuable piece of advertising as part of their logo.

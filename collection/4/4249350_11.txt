I think you mean extra toes, not "double paws."  It is a natural mutation, like no tail on the Manx, or the curly ears fo the Scottish Fold.  It is a recessive gene that doesn't always come out, but it certainly isn't from inbreeding.   Your girlfriend should be honored, as these "extra toed" cats are frequently known as Hemingway Cats as all of Ernest Hemingway's cats had extra toes.  Extra toed cats are considered lucky in many cultures, and tend to be more intelligent than the average cat.

I have watched people achieve lots of gold (money) and peace of mind outweighs gold. Lots of gold will lead to greediness. I have seen it happen in families with money and money that was inherited...Think about greediness; meanness; got to have more than you by taking off of you; throwing away family basis of brother/sisterhood trust and love. You know, there is nothing better than to have a sibling to go to when the late fifties, sixties and seventies come at you....not to compare, but to say, here is some extra that I cannot use (shifting stuff).....sit a while and life will be easier for a moment for the both of us..Don't throw gold away or the opportunity-learn how to handle it by researching people who had and now don't (testimonials); investment for a good cause.... Peace of mind; The ability to lay down and get a good sleep to rejuvenate the physical well being so daily chores can be accomplished. People with excess baggage have a hard time with peace of mind...How to achieve it is by doing the best you can at the time and prayers...

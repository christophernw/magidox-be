I believe it dates back to the court days when men--coming from battle to meet the noble ladies--wore helmets.  It was considered impolite and unchivalrous to not allow the women to see the face of the knights, so they were removed.. . I have no source for that, btw, I just remember reading it somewhere.  It's entirely possible that I'm wrong.

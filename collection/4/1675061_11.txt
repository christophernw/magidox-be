Pasteur proved that incorrect - i.e. spontaneous generation. Pasteur recognized the fact that both lactic and alcohol fermentation's were hastened by exposure to air. This led him to wonder whether his invisible organisms were always present in the atmosphere or whether they were spontaneously generated or evolved.  Pasteur was able to show that air contained spores of living organisms. When they were placed into nutrient broth the organisms reproduced.  When he now boiled the broth in a special 'swan necked' container, that allowed air in but kept dust out, the broth remained free of living organisms. This simple experiment helped disproved the theory of spontaneous generation.

Keep in touch with him via phone and internet. If you truly do care for him, you will want what is best for him, not for yourself. Be happy for him, keep in touch with him, and pray that he has a wonderful life. You on the other hand, should go out, meet new friends and enjoy a wonderful life!!! I hope you find the peace that you are looking for. Best wishes!!

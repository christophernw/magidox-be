I don't like their intrusive evangelism. Knocking on doors, harrassing you in the streets. Tricking you into taking their Watchtower (i think that's what it's called).. . Once two of them came into the store where i was working with a booket. The cover said something along the lines of "Reduce theft by youth" or something. So I took it and sat it aside. Later on, i got bored, and opened the booklet to read, and out falls the Watchtower! They tricked me into taking their propaganda.. . But i dont dislike them, i just am not too fond of them when they evangelize (if that is a word)

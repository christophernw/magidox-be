how bout giving him something feminine... that can't possibly be forgotten! a girl pal of mine gave her guy pal a G-string! it was so funny... and the guy said that he'd never forget it EVER! or just opt for something sentimental like a box of chocolates and some flowers... some guys are flattered by that... or maybe a vacation...or some sort of jewelry

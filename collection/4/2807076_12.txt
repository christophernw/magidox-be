If it has been sitting in the hot storage compartment of your motor home in summer and you get it out and accidentally drop it on the ground, it explodes. Then if you carefully get another, take it inside and drop it on the floor just before getting to the refrigerator, it blows up too. They you clean up all that sticky coke and drink water. At least that is what happened to me.

Well, it might be true for some, but not for all, I know, because I'm a very sensitive person who knows a good many sensitive people! However, I agree with what others are saying...There are times that you become insensitive because you don't want to get hurt, so you build a wall, & become cold. Especially in this world today, because we live in a very selfish world, where it's very hard to trust anyone.

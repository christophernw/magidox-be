E=MC2 means energy equals mass times the speed of light squared.  It applies to nuclear reactions because it disproves the Law of Conservation of Matter, which states neither mass nor energy can be destroyed.  In nuclear reactions mass can be converted into energy and vis versa, proven by Einstein's equation, thus causing the Law of Conservation of Matter to be re-written as neither mass nor energy can be destroyed in a chemical reaction.  This was an amazing breakthrough for the scientific world as we came into the nuclear age.

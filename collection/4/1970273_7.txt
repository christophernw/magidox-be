Kinetic energy can be expressed as:. . KE = (1/2) m v^2. . m = mass of the molecule. v = velocity of the molecule. . From kinetic temperature, this can also be expressed as:. . KE = (3/2) k T. . k = Boltzmann's constant. T = temperature. . Equating the two expressions:. . (1/2) m v^2 = (3/2) k T. . we see that v^2 is proportional to T. Therefore, as temperature rises, so does velocity.

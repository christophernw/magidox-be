Yes, there is a big difference. It is really fluid (liquid) or dry measure. One cup of milk weights 8oz, while one cup of raisins actual weights just more than 4oz.. All the measuring containers are marked in the liquid measure, whether it is ounces or cups.. That is the easiest way to explain it, without getting into the specific gravity of an item.

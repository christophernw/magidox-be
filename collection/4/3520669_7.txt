The most basic example I can think of is when a doctor, unwilling to deal with a grieving family, tells them that a patient who is terminal will get better.  This offers hope to the family, but if the patient will not survive, when he dies it just hurts the family all the more because they didn't have a chance to say goodbye or prepare themselves for the worst.  The doctor in this case did something evil, even if it was for the good intention of providing hope and comfort; because all it did was crush them even worse when it was over.

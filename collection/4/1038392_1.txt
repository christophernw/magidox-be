Girls are usually subjected to this as a young child, long past the time of infancy....the procedure is highly invasive and destructive, and can cause bleeding to death. the girl is gouged half to death...It is a very violent and painful thing to do to any child....it is also prolonged painful torture to have it done....while other just watch on and are entertained. She looks aroudn for someone to help her and no one helps...it scars her for life....she will never feel sexual pleasure..her body parts are sewed up with more gouging and pain, and and she is just a victim of her husband on her marrige night rather than a true mate.. . I don't know about muslims, but at the 8th day after brith is when it should be done for christians and jews. The procedure is done by either a rabbi or a medical doctor, and there is a mild anesthetic applied... for the jewish baby, he is given a few drops of wine applied with the tip of ones finger into a cup. The baby does not scream out of torture and violent pain...the procedure is quick and gentle...there may be some inital soreness. but the mother is there to provide comfort adn proper care. There can actually be some health benefits, since ther removal of the skin allows for better cleaning and sanitary maintenance of the skin. The male when he is an adult have experience sexual pleasure without any problems, since the procedure was very superficial.. . what is done to the female is not comparable to the male...there are religious reasons for the male, but there is no reason on earth for the female to be put through this.. . *** note. the 8th day is important for the male because his vitamin K levels are the highest after birth...this prevents excessive bleeding...as vitmin k is an anticoagulant.

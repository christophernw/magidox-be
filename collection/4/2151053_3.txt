When you say the Church, you're implying the Catholic Church?. . Because they're so afraid of offending more people after the sex abuse scandal. They need all the good PR they can get right now. Alienating more people would NOT help them.. . I'm sure they'll get back on the Anti-Homosexual Bandwagon someday. And they wonder why I don't come to church anymore!

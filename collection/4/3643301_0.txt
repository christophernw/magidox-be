Gothic architecture as a movement about the celebration of God as a form of supernatural light comes from about 1140 AD, with the commission of the Church at Saint Denis.  It is important to know that as with most art movements, Gothic architecture adopted a lot of pre-existing decorative styles into itself, it didn't just spring up entirely out of nothing.

Well if this guys likes you a lot, it's tough. There's no easy way to go about it, but the best thing is to be honest and let him know how you feel about him. If you tell him he probably wont want to be your friend because he'll be hurt so don't expect him to be cool about it. Just be honest and if you'll be friends it'll be up to him if he can accept you as such.

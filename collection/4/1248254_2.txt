The doctor that diagnosed this should be able to prescribe you appropriate drugs, depending on the cause of your high testosterone levels.  Without knowing the cause of your abnormally high testosterone levels, it's rather difficult for me to assist.  (LH secretion and Leydig cell function, gonaldal and adrenal function, diagnosis of hypogonadism, hypopituitarism, Klinefelter syndrome, and impotence are all associated with abnormal testosterone levels)  Please note that just because you feel more macho, it doesn't necessarily mean your testosterone levels are abnormally high.  So there may be no need to worry...

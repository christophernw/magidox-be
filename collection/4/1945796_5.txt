"Lust" means to desire something unlawfully. It doesnt have to mean sex, some lust for money, fame, posessions. But its to desire these things in an unlawful way. If I was married I could look at my wife and want to have sex with her and thats not lust, because it's lawful. If I was to look at someone elses wife and want to have sex with her, that's unlawful, and it is lust. To "worship" anything other than God is unlawful, so it would be lustful to worship someones body.

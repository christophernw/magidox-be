A hydrocarbon is a molecule consisting of carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms. The bond between the carbon and hydrogen can be a single (alkane type), double (alkene type) or triple (alkyne type) bond. For example methane is a simple hydrocarbon consisting of 1 carbon and 4 hydrogens bonded to it each with a single bond. Other common hydrocarbons are ethane, propane, pentane, hexane etc.. In fact, the field of organic chemistry deals quite a bit with hydrocarbons and there are at least hundreds to thousands of different types. They are use often used for fuels like gasoline and heating oil. One type of emissions from car exhaust are hydrocarbons.

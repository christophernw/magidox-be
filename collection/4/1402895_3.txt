my cat did that exact same thing. i absolutly LOVE the smell of mexican food, so when i washed my socks, i put about 6 drops of hot sauce in the machine. (yep it perfectly safe, i checked with my parents) so when she chewed on them, she got a unplesant surprise. and i got a nice mexican smell. lol. some people told me thats animal cruelty.i dont think so. but hey, nothiin else worked!!

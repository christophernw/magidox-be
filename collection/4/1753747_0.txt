I worked for an Alarm comp for a long time. The silent alarm works like this.. once the button is pressed an emergency/distress signal is received at your Central Station Monitoring Company-they in turn contact the PD immediately and the PD is dispatched. Your total turnaround time (hopefully you have a good central station monitoring co) is no more than 2-6 minutes!

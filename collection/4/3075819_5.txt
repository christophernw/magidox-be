Brasso -- google it and you'll see that it's very popular among ipod users.  it costs less than $3 at any grocery store, meant for polishing metals and acrylic.  it'll work on the plastic part, but not so much for the metal.  lots of elbow grease required (6-10 applications minimum), but the little scratches will vanish.

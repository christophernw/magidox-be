You must write to the Governor and/or the Attorney General stating what had happened, your time served, your current condition and what you have been doing since you have been released. If you can enclose a letter of recommendation from your local sheriff, police chief or mayor, would be very helpful. The bottom line of the letter is you'll be asking for a pardon for your crime so you can have your rights returned.. . Good Luck!

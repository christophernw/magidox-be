All the major networks, FOX included, have somewhat of a liberal bias and have had for years. FOX seems more conservative than the others therefore appearing to be less liberal, but overall, they can be as liberal as any.. . Here's an OPED quote:. The second annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative was more proof that Clinton walks around with the major media in his jacket pocket. Look no further than the long list of so-called "featured attendees" who associated themselves with the event. Many of them were moderators of panel discussions -- not only predictable names like George Stephanopoulos, but Tom Brokaw, Judy Woodruff, Newsweek international editor Fareed Zakaria, CNN anchors Zain Verjee and Sanjay Gupta, and NPR anchor Michele Norris. Katie Couric, Diane Sawyer and Christiane Amanpour were also on the list of supportive media attendees.

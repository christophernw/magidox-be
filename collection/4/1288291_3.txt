Although I am not generally a fan of JWs as they are just too "out there" and their religion hinges upon unhealthy for many of its members, they may have a point on the flag being an idolic symbol.  We've made patriotism a form of civil religion ever since John Winthrop and the Puritans proclaimed America a shining "City on a Hill". American exceptionalism in any form can become ugly, narcissitic and idolatrous. Blind patriotism in support of the "perpetual" war on 'terror' is a good example.

K so here's my thing on God.  I think its kinda funny. . So God was sitting up in heaven with Jesus and the Holy spirit.  Years went by and God found that talking to them was like talking to himself.  How boring right.... go figure.  So after great debate with them or him.....hmmmm.....he decided that he wanted some new fellowship and so he made us and that in my opinion is what happened....don't think its such a bad idea.....God does have the best sense of humour.. And with the hurt and suffering we shouldn't dwell on that too much there's always a reason for it whether we are supposed to learn something or we are just going threw a time of pruning.  That is when we are supposed to rely on god the most.  Our reward for passing the tests will be great in heaven.  Just be patient.

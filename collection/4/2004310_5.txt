Sometimes goldfish in general (but this kind more often) turn color because of age, food, or even due to the amount of sunlight. It likely sunlight or full spectrum light deficiency because, when humans don't go in the sun very often, we turn pale, but when we tan, we go to a brown color, similar with goldfish.

War is good for the economy because the government employs countless workers and funnels countless dollars into the economy for weapons and defense.  The private sector builds weapons.  The government puts out contracts for weapons, weapons manufacturers create jobs to meet the demand, and those new employees now start pumping their earnings back into the economy.. . Look at how great job growth is in the US right now.. . It was WWII that actually pulled us out of the Great Depression.  We started building our $h!t up to deter Nazi Germany's aggression.  The Cold War saw us further growth and opportunity because the very nature of the "war" was to build a forever bigger arsenal.. . It's a sad economic fact: war is good for the economy.

Jack Russells have extremely high energy and need to be exercised a lot.  Here's a couple of suggestions.. . 1. Keep him in a room where he can do little damage like the kitchen.  They can jump pretty well so you would have to keep it closed off with a high gate.  Make sure that all dangerous chemicals are kept away from him.. . 2. I would suggest crating him if you can come home after 4 hours.  If not keeping him in a crate for 8-10 hours is too long.. . 3. Keep the radio or TV on for comfort.  It does work wonders.. . 4. Take a Kong and put creamy peanut butter in it.  Freeze that overnight.  It will keep him occupied for a long time.. . 5. He should also have other toys that are suitable to his level of play.. . 6. Most important.  Take him on a long walk in the morning before you leave and then again as soon as you get home.  If you can, take him to a dog park.  Dogs get destructive when they have energy and can't release it.

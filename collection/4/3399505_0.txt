Its simple and depends on 'which-country-do-you-live-in?'!. . With your motorola V3 pack, u would have recieved a user's guide. Look for 'Support' topic in that guide. On that support's page, look if your country is listed with support centre phone no. Call your local motorola support centre and ask them to give you your new phone guide. They might ask you to call after a dya or two. But they will definitely ask for IMEI of ur fone.... . And in case your country is not listed, then go for local mobile fone repair shop!. . And if you have lost ur instruction manual, visit motorola global and see if your countries listed.. . Moreover, if none of this helps, try remembering any important numbers or words u use for ur passwords or ur private nos.. . Hope this helps.. . And last but not least,. if u r totally hopeless...spend some money :. try calling any of motorola international service centres, such as motorola UK, etc.

She's just a baby.  Our dog used to do this, she'll grow out of it.  It's just a game to her.. . In the meantime try putting the line up high so she can't reach it (but this didn't work with our dog!) or else, tie her up while the washing is drying.  Also, try this, put the washing out, then take her for a really long walk.  She'll be exhausted when she gets back, too exhausted to play her little game.. . We also used to tie a tennis ball on a piece of elastic to the clothesline when it wasn't being used for the washing & she used to jump up and try to grab it.  She used to love this and stopped trying to get the washing because she knew the tennis ball was her own special toy.. . Let me know in your feedback if anything worked, I'd be interested to know.

what i think you should do is get a good lawyer to represent you.  If you were falsely accused the police probably have no evidence of the crime.  But honestly i don't know if you will be able to sue, unless you have any visible harm, and if you do have any bumps or bruises from the arrest take pictures to present in a court. that's all i can tell you sorry if it isn't any help!

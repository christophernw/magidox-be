i know how you feel my dad wont ever stop. he tried once. but it only succeeded for about 3-4 months. try talking your mom out of it. like wen you know she's going out for a smoke ask her to do something for u. or pretend u have something to talk to her about. if she says later just say u need to talk toher now. you can also take all her cigarettes and throw them away.

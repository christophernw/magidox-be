The answer is kind of complicated.  To explain it as simply as possible, it has to do with the fact that the Gulf Stream is just one part of an enormous, clockwise-spinning gyre in the North Atlantic that is powered by a combination of the Earth's rotation, interaction with semi-permanent high and low pressure regions, and surface winds.  The net effect is  to channel large of amounts of warm water northward in the  west Atlantic (as the Gulf Stream), and an equal amount of cool water south in the eastern Atlantic (as the Canary Current).

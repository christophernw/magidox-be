The gas mileage for some hybrids is better in the city because they spend more time using their electric motor instead of their gas engine.  Most hybrids have battery packs which are charged by what is called "generative breaking".  Instead of slowing down with traditional braking, these cars store some of the energy from braking into a battery pack.  Then when the light changes and the car moves again, the energy stored in the battery can be used to move the car, or assist the engine in moving the car.. . In the city this effect can be more pronounced because of more frequent stopping and starting.

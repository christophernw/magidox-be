Too much on your mind or it could be what you are eating. Stay away from junk food,sugar and caffeine for a few days to test it out. Relax, take a hot shower or bath [lavender if you have any will soothe you] a night time tea will help[decaf of course] or exercise. Are you napping during the day because of it? If you are get up and get moving so you can sleep at night. Good luck.... hope you sleep well!

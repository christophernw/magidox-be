Really a man has three stages of mind -CONSCIOUS,SUB CONSCIOUS AND NON CONSCIOUS.When we are doing work the first two are active.When we suffering from severe sickness we will be in non conscious stage.But when we are sleeping conscious mind is not active,but sub conscious mind is well active.That is why we know where we slept,when we slept etc.Many researches states that ,if you place a book and a pen near you when you are going to sleep and make a decision that you will remember what you have seen in your dream,it will work.That is you can write down quickly the things that you have seen in the dream after you wake up.. Try out . Good Luck

Though the whole scene really just took place in the mind of a writer called Homer, the most remarkable part of the whole bit was the offering of the Trojan Horse. I mean, even in their TV shows, from days of old, you'll see that it has been used over and over again, and take note, not only in serious themes but even in comical too. So in real life, it will not be a surprise if they do use that. Lesson learned: not everything that looks nice are really what they appear to be. =)

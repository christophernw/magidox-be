I think that if we're created, the reason that we're created is kind of a test. That we can go through an entire life, and by the end of it, still believe that we were created. Of course, I believe in happiness. Being happy definately has an impact of the meaning of life. However, being happy isn't a chore, if you believe in a creator. It's simply different from those who don't.

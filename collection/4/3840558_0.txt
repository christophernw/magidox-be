Not bad for fiction.  I do not believe that they are evil or promote magic.  The are meant to entertain and educate.  They all have a moral lesson built into them.  I am glad they they have bolstered reading in many middle schools.. Not to knock anyone, but I would guess that the decendants of the people who burnt witches a couple of hundred years ago are the ones who are complaining about the books on moral grounds today.

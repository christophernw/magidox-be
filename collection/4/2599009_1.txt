In order to do this you need to contact the office of the political representative where you live or perhaps the senators office of your constituency. This is unlike transferring university credits and so I do not think it would be the education board. I think your best bet is to ask your local political representative because the office you will need to contact will be different in different states and since you pay taxes you may as well take advantage of the civil service and ask someone to wade through all the bureaucracy for you. Good luck.

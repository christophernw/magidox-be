GERMAN SHEPARD'S, AND GERMAN POLICE DOG? I LIVE IN U.S.A . MY DOG IS 3 AND WAS ONCE A POLICE DOG TOO.. . One is train to do one thing and the other to defend an officer, tracks drugs, help people etc. Even if the German Shepard's are train to Gide. The police training is better. So the police dog is the better choice. If you find out were this dog was train and for what you can use that train in your advantage.

LMAO You don't think that works both ways? I live in a state where hunting isn't just a part of life, for some people, it is the only way they'll get through the winter. City-dwelling liberals from the lower 48 CONSTANTLY try to tell us that we shouldn't own guns, we shouldn't hunt, etc. . . Between our state and federal parks plus the Native corporations, only 1% of Alaskan lands are privately held. And yet Democrats keep preventing us from drilling in ANWR - something the vast majority of Alaskans support.. . I don't personally have a problem with gay marriage, but you guys are trying to force the American public to accept it, even though polls show the public doesn't want it. . . Liberals are constantly trying to eliminate all symbols of Christianity, even though an overwhelming number of Americans ARE Christians, and I've yet to meet anyone who isn't a Christian who is offended by Christmas trees. Liberals also think it's okay to display Jewish and Muslim religious symbols, but not Christian. (Do a search for it - lots of stories out there.) . . What about freedom of speech? INVITED Conservative speakers are either shouted down or canceled on universities all the time - guess the only freedom of speech that counts is liberal speech. . . I could go on, but it's just depressing me. Just remember - plenty of stupidity to go around. Your side doesn't have the corner on the market, and neither does mine.

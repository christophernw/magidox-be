I believe Einsteins Theory of Relativity states that anything travel ling faster than the speed of light turns into energy.. . But now it is thought that the speed limit can be skirted by warping space/time around the object traveling, kind of cheating...or by using wormholes, to travel great distances without having to go that fast.

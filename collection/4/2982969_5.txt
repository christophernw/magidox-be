The most common sign of a urinary tract infection or kidney infectin/disease is a cat 'missing' the litter box.  This happened to my prior cat and I missed the signs thinking she was just being silly...thousands of dollars later she died in days.  Get her to the vet right away so they can check her bloodwork and urine.  In the urine they can check for blood and the bloodwork will tell of any abnormal signs.  Will this cost some money?  Yes but not as much if you catch it early and get it taken care of!  Besides you are her guardian and you're all she's got!

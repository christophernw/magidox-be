Long time ago, even before I was born, and I had a dinosaur for a pet.  The only available paint was red lead based paint. Which is why you see so many red barns out in the country side.  When the hired help get paid and go into town on Friday nights, they go in to "Kick up their Heels", "Go to a Shindig"or a "Hoe Down" and "Paint the town Red!"

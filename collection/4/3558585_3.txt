Evolution is the process by which modern organisms have descended from ancient ancestors. Evolution is responsible for both the remarkable similarities we see across all life and the amazing diversity of that life.. Fundamental to the process is genetic variation upon which selective forces can act in order for evolution to occur.. Some people do not agree with this theory. They believe that there was another higher force which made word as it is with all the changes occurring by devine design.

For the purposes of this-- you are party "1".. . If you are starting the call (1-2-3), or if you are connecting party 2 to party 3 (2-1-3), it's still the same.. . In the first case, you call party 2, ask them to hold while you connect with party 3, and use the "flash" or "hold" button on your phone to put them on hold.  You dial the call to party 3.  When you have them on the line, simply push the "flash" button again.  Now all three of you can talk.. . In the second version, you are already on the line with party 2.  You simply use the procedure the same way as above to involve party 3.. . In some regions, you can use the other parties' call-conferencing to establish a long chain of participants in a big conference call -- check with your phone company.  Not sure of how long the chain can be-- but the other parties put you on hold while they establish connections with their third party.  Even if your region is limited to a closed/extended 3 party connection, parties 2 and 3 should be able to connect with their third line, resulting in a 5-way conference. Of course, all the parties involved in the call have to have the service (it's not usually free)-- but you knew that. :). . Hope this helped!

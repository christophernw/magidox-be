I once made the mistake of marrying a catholic, and according to him, the priests are called "father" because they represent God, the Father on earth. They are given in the church the same capabilities of God, ie, forgiving sins, blessings, etc. They are divine representatives of Diety. So they are called "Father" to show their oneness with God.

Yes, I've thought of this, and there are two answers. The first one is not to commit a crime- no evidence, no victims, no restitution!. . The second is this- go buy a movie ticket, and start a small fire in an alley. Get on your bike with some gloves and a rock. Ride by the school library, throw a rock in the window, go past the alley, drop the gloves in the fire, and then go into the movie theatre!. . When you come home say "I didn't throw that rock in the window, if that's what you think."

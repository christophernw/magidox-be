Mexicans are native americans, that is why you are always confused for latin or hispanic because there are.. . And when the spanish invasion happened (anglos) they mass murdered the aztecs and incas (which are modern day mexians, hispanics, latinos) which have been  mixed with the native american blood line.. . It even goes further into south america where they are mixed with everything and have a native american ancestry.. . Native americans goes as far from canada all the way to the bottom of south america, (native americans are not of a pure ancestry anymore).

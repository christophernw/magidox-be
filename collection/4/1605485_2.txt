I was an exchange student last year in america and as simple as it sound my advice you can buy anything in Germany too ao don't bring too much luggage ;) I did the same thing. . . As far as preparing in like language goes watch movies and try to read like news in German on websites and stuff or try to speak to some German people over the Internet. Also try to prepare the language that is used in Treier (Tier?). We Germans like to speak in our MANY dialects that can be hard to understand most of the time! ;) Even for Germans.... . Culture... is quite different than the American one, I guess you're from America? We're not as friendly, we don't tell evcerybody on the street hi and stuff. This could seem really unfriendly but we just greet like the people we're close to ad you can be sure that this friendlieness is real! There is more drinking and partying going on and all in all people are more liberal. . . I don't know you'Re exact situation otherwise I could answer more questiones or more detailed ;). . Have fun over here!

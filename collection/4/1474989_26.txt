My dad was killed in a head-on collision when he was 70.  It was horribly sudden and unfair, but he was a good man and we loved him very much.  I immediately knew he didn't feel the crash, and that he probably didn't have time to react.  It was, IMHO, God's way of telling us he'd lived enough, and it was time for him to go home.. . I don't like the idea of using other people's deaths as an example of what not to do.  What then do we make of children murdered at the hands of their parents?  Did the parents make appropriate "examples" of these victims?  What kind of "example" should we make out of me losing my dad?. . Your friend had a very serious problem, and one that is difficult to overcome.  I'm sorry for your loss.  I hope the guy who administered the shot now needs to answer for what evil he did.  God didn't kill her, though.  He gives us free will, even when this is difficult for him to do, and knowing that we still make mistakes.  . . When you're a parent, you'll understand this.  When you let your kids go out into the world, you have no idea what kind of trouble they can get into when you're not looking.  You hope your kids will make the right decisions, but you understand that eventually these decisions are not yours to make.  God is like that.  He is our father and watches over us and tries to protect us, but He will never control the decisions we make.

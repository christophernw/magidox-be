I saw a cat walk across my grandmother's kitchen table once.  All of a sudden I heard the broom's woosh sound, a meow, and a thump.  I saw the cat slide down the wall, shake its head and run outside.  I never saw the cat on the table again.  If Grandma was a baseball player, she'd be a homerun hitter.

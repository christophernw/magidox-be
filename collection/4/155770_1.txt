For example, imagine a solution of common salt in water.. The common salt(the solid) is the solute.. The water in which you dissolve the solute is the solvent.. The resultant liquid is the solution.. You should note the weight of the salt, and water, and the ratio between the two is the ratio of solute to solution.

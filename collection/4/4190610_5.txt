I went to live at 13 with my Sis when she was there with her husband at the end of the Vietnam War..Camden and Dover for i think about 6 months ..Man..it was flat..i remember that Delaware had water mocassins which freaked me out and that Wilmington was said to be a tough town..i remember watching planes return with the last of the soldiers return from the war at Dover Airforce Base, the tearful reunions (my B-in Law worked on the base and i went with him sometimes)..i met the only Amish people ive ever met there (might have been in another state?)...as a teenager back at home Bad to the Bone was a big tune so i heard a lot of George Thorogood and the Delaware Destroyers..Delaware is remembered a lot for that song  but many may not realize it..man it was flat..i know, i know everybody says that..God i cant stand the long link items people place on these things..Cheeseheads oh i get it..how about Boneheads ( from the song)? One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer..

My "Christianity" is a work in progress.  But I'll tell you this, even in full force there will be nothing that I like better than an inch-thick ribeye, grilled to perfection and topped with Shitaki 'shrooms.  To give that up, I wouldn't be living.  And I don't indulge myself often enough to clog an artery.

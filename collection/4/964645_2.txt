I loved your answer for anna1 about "Social" programs. I see you read and it's refreshing to see people like you who know what they are talking about. Very Refreshing. Visit my blog and leave comments anytime. It is my hope that you will share more of your good sense with all. BTW, the mindless dribble of the "Neocons" is the subject of my next book.

The number on the bottom of a fraction tells how many pieces it takes to make 1 whole.  So think like this:  9/4 means if you put 4 of something together it will make 1 whole, so if you  have 9 of those pieces you can use 4 to make 1 whole, 8 will make 2 wholes and you will have one piece (1/4) left over.  so 9/4= 2 1/4. . 18/5 means, if it takes 5 to make one whole, how many wholes and how many parts will you make with 18 of them.  5 together will make 1 whole, 10 will make 2 wholes, 15 will make 3 wholes and you'll have 3 pieces left over (3/5), so 13/5=3 3/5. . Good luck

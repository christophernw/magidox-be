I can't answer that question. What I do know is that time and space are manifestations of our universe. So therefore before our universe existed, the *concept* of space (3 dimensions or however many you subscribe to) and time didn't exist yet. . . Same is true when you consider that if our universe is expanding, it has a size. Then what is outside the extent of it. Answer: same as above - there is no "outside" because space and time donâ€™t exist there.. . Mind bending if you really think about it.. . On the topic of what happened just after the big bang - at some point the universe expanded and cooled to a point where matter condensed into solid form (neutrons/protons/electrons etc). Before that point the universe was too hot for any kind of matter. All the energy in the universe prior to that point was pure energy - no mass. There is no conservation of mass, only conservation of energy.

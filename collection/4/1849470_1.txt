I have answered this same question so many times that I think I am talking to myself. There is a big difference between the Episcopalian and Baptist unless you live in the South. Everything in the South has a Baptist flair to it, so I am told. . . There are High Church Episcopalians, like myself, who have a similar believe and practice as the Roman Catholic. There are Low church Episcopalians that are more like Methodist. . . The biggest differences can be seen sometimes in the same congregation of a Broad Episcopal Church. The High church people pray to the Saints, bow, kneel, cross themselves, etc. and follow the theology that go with it. Low church do not do any of these things. . . The Baptist church, like most Protestant churches see the Bible as everything. The RC and Orthodox Church see the Bible and the Oral Traditions of the Church (Called Holy Tradition) as equally important. The Episcopal church say there are 3 things like legs on a stool. Bible, Holy Tradition, and Reason. (we are the ones that say that God gave you a mind and expects you to use it.). . I am quite surprised that you and your husband have not have major arguments about religion since your backgrounds are so different. This tell me that probably neither of you really know what the Church that you grew up in believes.. . Most Protestant church (some more than others) push the "Born Again" idea of accepting Jesus as your personal savior. RC, Orthrodox and Episcopalian (also called Anglican) don't push this idea. We are all expected to Love God and Jesus and grow more and more into both fellowship with Him and in the image of Christ with the help of the Holy Spirit.

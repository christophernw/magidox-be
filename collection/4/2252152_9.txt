Simple.  You've told him how you feel.  You don't have anything else to say to him.  You don't want to get back together with someone who abuses you, so you don't need his apology.  If he rings your doorbell, don't answer.  If he calls you, either don't pick up (if you have caller ID) or hang up on him.  If you don't want to talk to him, DON'T.

I presume that the RNA nucleotide containing uracil as its nitrogenous base is more stable than the RNA nucleotide containing thymine.  This must be vice versa with DNA.  RNA or DNA nucleotides containing either thymine or uracil are all complementary to DNA or RNA nucleotides containing Adenine.  It is therefore all to do with probability of occurence of the more stable form, and of inclusion in the polynucleotide that is subsequently created.

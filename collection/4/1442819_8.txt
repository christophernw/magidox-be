Wow, quite a few answers many of them saying the same thing.. . Let me set a few things straight.  Most people here are confusing skeptics with atheists.  Skeptics are people who do not believe in the supernatural.  An atheist could very well believe in ghosts, auras, ESP, etc.  All being an atheist means is that they do not believe in a god or gods.  That's it.  Skeptics are a subset of atheism (not all atheists are skeptics, but all skeptics are atheist).. . An agnostic is someone who wishes to straddle the fence because it is impossible to prove/disprove the existence of a supernatural supreme being.  For example:  Does Santa Claus exist?  A skeptic would say, "nope"... an agnostic would say, "can't say".. . Skeptics hold as few beliefs as possible.  They operate with logic and rational thought.  Example:  Will the sun rise tomorrow?  Many theists would say, "I believe it will".  Most skeptics would say, "No, I don't 'believe' it will.  Instead, I have theories about how the earth rotates and revolves around the sun.  According to my theories, I can predict that the sun will appear on the eastern horizon at __:__ time."

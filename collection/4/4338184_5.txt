Though Ionci compounds tend to be very stable, they dissolve very easily in water. The + ions are surround by OH- ions, and the - ions by H+ ions. Every thing is able to move around freely, so there are many electrons moving around. So when a potentiol difference (voltage) is applied, there is an electric current.

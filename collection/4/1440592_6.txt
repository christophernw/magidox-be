There can not be peace in the world because mankind continues to choose ignorance over knowledge, hate over love, and conflict over resolution.  Peace can only be brought about if mankind will expand his knowledge, fill his heart with love, and bring peaceful resolutions to conflicts.  To say that there can't be peace in the world is not true, because there can; if mankind is willing to do what it takes to achieve it.  Peace is the absence of conflict which would be a very difficult goal to achieve.  Instead of wishing for peace, we should all live peace and set a precedent for others to follow.  A man filled with conflict can not bring peace to the world, unless first he has peace in his own heart.  A man with peace in his own heart has the greatest peace of all.

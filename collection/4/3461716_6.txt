How old is your bunn? What are you feeding him? Hay is essential 24/7, is as important as water, to ensure correct gut flora. And any change in diet, changing over pellets, or introducing vegies, must be done very very gradually, otherwise can cause diarrhoea. Diarrhoea can also be caused by furballs during moult, and part-stomach-blockages by not enough fibre (ie, not enough hay). Please have a read of this very important article, which every bunny carer should discover for our bunnies' health - . http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/ileus.html.

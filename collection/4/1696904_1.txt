Okay. You need to know that ice and melted ice is WATER. Water is a group of molecules (two Hydrogen and one Oxygen(. They form a Micky mouse shape. Oxygen is the head and the hydrogen is the ear.. Ice is in the form of a solid. Molecules are held together by bonds. Think of a little bar that holds two balls together. This is the bond. When we have a solid, the oxygen atom has many hydorgen bonded to it. In other words, it has many bars attached to the Oxygen that lead to hydrogens. Now, one hydrogen atom can be bonded to two Oxygens at the same time. Think of a gap in the earth. The two cliffs represent the oxygen and you are between these two cliffs. YOu represent the hydrogen and the bridge represents the bonds. When temperature is low and  pressure is high, more bonds form. Think of bouncing balls in a room. When it is hot, these balls have a  lot of energy from the high temperature, so they can bounce really fast. And the smaller the room and the colder the room the less they can move around. When you put water in the freezer, it becomes so cold that the H2O (water) has less energy to move around (thus the why liquids can form to any shape) and more bonds (bridges) can be built between oxygens and hydrogens. Ice weighs the same when melted because the SAME amount of H's and O's are present. It is like having a sandcastle then taking the same amount of sand but in a different form then weighing them both. The same amount of sand is in the castle or in the lump of sand. Clear?

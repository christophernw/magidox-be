Okay. I'll take this as a serious question and not as a putdown. . . Some religions, the Roman Catholics to name one, believe that people have souls. A soul is something believed to survive after the body has died. The soul then enters a transistory state in preparation for judgment or atonement. In the Roman Catholic belief, this place or state is called purgatory. Other religions have similar concepts and beliefs.. . Praying for the dead is believed to help these souls atone for their sins committed while on earth.

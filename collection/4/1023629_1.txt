What an ignorant question.. . They don't beleive in 330 million gods at all.. . They beleive in one God but worship Him through different "faces" if you like.. . Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer are all aspects of God.. . As are their female counterparts - Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati.  . . And the Avatars of Vishnu (Rama, Krishna etc). . Its like one person might have different names to many - he can be son, dad, brother, nephew, uncle etc depending on whose point of view you're looking at.  Its the same with God.

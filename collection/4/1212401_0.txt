Most things we use in real life are created using Geometrical formulae.(Wheels,Table,Drums,Cube etc etc...). . Imagine you need to say a carpet in your hall.How do you tell the Carpet store?? Length and width. Right!.... . Irregular shapes in our life would add more complications.It would be very hard to make standards because there can be a lot of irregular shapes.. . Using regular shapes makes life easier and Geometry lets you deal with them.. . HTH

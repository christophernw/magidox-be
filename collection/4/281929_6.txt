Why?  Did it sneeze?. . Just kidding.. . Have your pastor or a church elder come over and bless it.  We actually had a "blessing party" and had a bunch of people over from church.  As friends walked through the house they were encouraged to "pray for" whichever room they felt led to pray for, then one of the elders said a formal blessing, then we had a bbq & hung out!

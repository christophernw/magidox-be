Hint, clue, when Congress votes they vote Republican on every issue. Clue, Bu$h is a Republican.. Fact, Sept. 11th. was the greatest failure of our "Government" in the History of our nation to protect Americans. In the "Corporation" we fire failures.. Those that voted for Bu$h and Republicans in Congress would do it again if they could, they have no regrets. They still think they did the right thing for the Country by Voting for "tax Cuts for every American". Republicans making over $300,000 a year could care less how many American die in Iraq, Republicans also care less about the $2 trillion cost of war in Iraq. Republicans will not pay it. They want others to pay for that mistake. Republicans  also don't care at all about the debt run up by Republicans in Congress, which will suck the pockets of the working class for 30 years to come. Republicans also don't care that Government is bigger now not smaller. Many have Government jobs at Local, State and Federal levels. Republicans also don't care that we have 22 million illegals, they want more not less... BTW, I did not get a tax cut, my taxes are higher under Republicans not lower.

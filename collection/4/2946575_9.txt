i know this can be confussing.  I am gay and it was hard for me. I started to know i liked guys in elementry school but i denied it for yrs.  I dated girls trying to cover up even had sex with my fair share of women, while thinking of men.  I actually fell in love with a girl.  She had the best personality and we got along but i was in love with her soul i was never attracted to her.  So if you feel a strong attraction to the same sex and even more than just sex you want to be with them all the time you may be gay.  i have none guys and girls who just liked to occasionally have sex with the same sex and they are not gay because they could never see themselves in a relationship with one just they found one or two people in the same sex that were so beautiful they could not take it.. Also gay is a relative term men and women in prison have sex but because they have no choices and they need that outlet upon release they go back to the opposite sex most of the time

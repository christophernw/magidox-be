Check-out their surroundings...I came home to have my big white fur-ball of a cat running away from me after glancing back at me.  He acted guilty of something so I followed him into my daughter's room.  He looked up at me and dropped a cookie he had in his mouth.  It was partly eaten---he was caught red-handed (or pawed).  I found my daughter had a package of sugar cookies on her desk in her room and he had apparently been snacking on them around the house.  --no wonder he weighs 22 lbs :)

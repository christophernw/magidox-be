I see a lot of specific answers, and I'm sure that you would like a more broadly basded spectrum of what you should be doing rather than specific suggestions. Well if you want to lose wieght it's a fairly simple formula. You have to burn more calories than you take in. This will burn fat reserves from your body. To accomplish this, there are two things you must do. You have to increase the calories your body burns. You can do this with exercise. I recommend runing or jogging at least 2 miles a day, and lots of walking. If you like any athletic activities they are a great way to exercise. The second and most important thing you must do is decrease your calorie intake and this doesnt nessecarily mean starving yourself. You are probably going to have to eat less and smaller portions. Breakfast and a snack or two before dinner with help you eat more in moderation. Celery is a good low calorie food to eat if you like celery. You have to cut out foods that will hinder your weight loss, this includes sodas, chocolate, and foods that are greasy or high in fat. If you are a heavy pop drinker stop drinking pop altogether. Some people stop drinking soda and lose ten pounds just from that.. I hope this helps you outline what you should be doing to lose weight. Good luck!

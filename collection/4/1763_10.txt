I have migraines, I like to block out all light into the room, and do deep breathing excercises, and if that doesn't work, I start doing my pain therapy classes... I tighten up one group of muscleson a slow inhale, starting with neck/shoulders and releasing the tension on exhale.  If it's not too bad, some classical or soft music in the background can help.  I usually end up falling asleep, please try it!

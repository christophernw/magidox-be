God says the only WAY we can come back to Him is by His Son Who said "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life" and "No one comes to the Father but by Me".. . The reason is that we sin against a Holy God (and against ourselves, His creation). He provided a way of redemption. If there were other ways of redemption, easier ways, then why wouldn't He have chosen them? Easier ways for us; even more so, easier ways for Him; anything that would have been easier than bearing our Sins in His sinless perfect and previously unblemished Body on the Cross?. . But, He is God and we are not. He has said there is a Way, the ONLY Way, back to fellowship with Him. He has said there is One Way of Atonement.  True, many seek other paths to Heaven. There is a way that seems right to humans, but the ways thereof are the ways of death.. . Why do many want to insist on doing things THEIR way when the Way of Atonement has been clearly set forth? "Look unto Me and be ye saved, all the ends of the Earth; for I am God and there is none other".

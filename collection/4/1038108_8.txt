Usually when i daydream or recall memory it is usually in third person also. Most of the time when i recall memory it is to think to myself "What if i did this" or "Maybe it wouldn't have happened that way IF" its nothing to be worried about. deep down, subconciously you probably want to see yourself as others saw you at the moment in time.

As previous posters indicated, he'll probably outgrow the most obnoxious level of misbehaviour, but not his love of/fascination with water. Forget the placemat: save the floor by getting a boot tray (the kind that goes next to the door for muddy, snowing boots) or a rubber car mat (the kind that advertises it holds a quart or more of water/snow melt) for underneath the water dish, which should be ceramic, cylindrical and shallow, so it cannot be tipped over. That way, you've contained the splashed water and don't have to worry about an overturned bowl.

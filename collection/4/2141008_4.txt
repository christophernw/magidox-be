Plants produce fruits grains and vegetables.  Pot is a weed, like rag weed, dandelion and many others.  Some plants produce poisonous toxins as a defense against insects.  Tea leaves are also among the toxins plants however it's toxicity is extremely low.  Yet, too much can kill.. . Pot is for the empty headed people.  Yes, I've tried it, but I have also grown up a long time ago.  For you, pot should become a distant memory.. . As for the Bible, it clearly said the plants bearing fruit and seed, not the plants themselves.  Since the bible is such a big book (or collections of smaller books) I'd suggest reading it through entirely, then read it again 3 more times entirely.  You will begin to see the connections, and won't need to ask stupid questions any more.. . I've read the bible entirely over the last 30 years about (estimating) 8 or 9 times.  There are still many things to be learned.. . Since you are so smart then why don't you go gnaw on a rose bush?

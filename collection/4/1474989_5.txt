Feel your feelings... you do not have to ACT on each one you have though.. . Be sad.. Be angry.. Be confused.. Ask questions.. Just don't let it control you....examine how and why you feel.. . First of all, the body is WHAT you are IN, not WHO you are.. . Second, Death is NOT an end to LIFE, it is an end to the TANGIBLE experience here.. . Third, Religions are humanity attempting to explain God.. . Fourth, it is each person's FREE WILL to decide WHY anything happens and WHO are you in relation to it?. . Fifth, TIME is an illusion of this tangible reality...  nothing happens on accident because there isn't anything God doesn't know about before it happens.  . . Your friend made a decision of FREE WILL..... and now she understands exactly what the risk really was.  But God loves her as much now and ever, because God IS love and God is all ways God.. . When it is your "time" to go home, God will show you the way...... and everything will make sense to you then.. . You are not required to understand everything.... that is why FAITH is important.  . . If God intends for you to KNOW, you will know.  If not, then have faith that God is showing you all you need for now.. . You are going to be okay.... God will not give you more than you can handle.  . . God didn't TAKE your friend to "hurt" you... Your friend made a choice and choices effect all of us.  You are closer to her than me, so you feel it more.. . Feelings are HUMAN/Conditional.... enjoy your tears for now.. . Sad is HOW you are able to recognize HAPPY.. . Blessings to you.

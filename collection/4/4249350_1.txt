I think you should ask the vet, I have a friend that her Dog had Pups and one had 6 toes. Never heard of this with a cat, but if you have a cat that loves you and you love your kitty, who cares? One thing that bothers me, they put sulfites in cat food, I don't understand this. This is not good. Since these companies started this I have had 2 cats that had and have asthma. This causes allergies and other problems, the only thing we can do is write the company and make a stink out of it. This is unnecessary those additives.

I actually went through this last year when my daughter was in Pre-K which is in the public schools in GA...I went the next day for a conference with the principal and when nothing was done I contacted the Supt. office...do not talk to anyone BELOW the supt. themselves, they will try to get you to talk to someone else, and when they didn't resolve the issue I contacted DFACS who did an investigation and contacted a lawyer.  If there were witnesses I would go ahead and sue if no resolution is given at the school level.  When I contacted the lawyer he said I should have called him before I called DFACS, but the first two steps (school and supt. office) were correct.  "move up the ladder for resolution" as he put it

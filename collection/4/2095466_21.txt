Why not? well, some people like my family have been dreaming for long time to move to Canada and stay there forever (such a nice dream...). However, the conditions are very hard to be reached for foreign people. Like have to pay the money in very large amount. Only very rich people who can do that. Beside, the living cost in Canada is very expensive for foreigners. Because the difference of the currency rates. And the language, too. can you imagine how to live there with poor condition in the first weeks, or maybe years? Different language, expensive living cost, adaptation, etc. That's why not all people move to Canada. . . Some of them dream it. But a few of them can reach it. They are the lucky guys. Not everyone is lucky.

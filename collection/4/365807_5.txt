Autism is not increasing, its always been there.  Its just Doctors and health professionals are recognising this nowadays and more children and people are being diagnosed with it.  There are probably thousands of people who have never been diagnosed.  The earlier a child is diagnosed the better, the child can get the proper help and education he/she needs to get on in life as much as possible.

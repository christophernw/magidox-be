easter is a pagan holiday celebrated for the pagan goddess.  It is not christian at all to call the day Jesus arose from the dead Ester.  It is a horroble thing.  Even the ester egges and the ester bunny itself is derived from this pagan holiday. You should not call it that or do any of the earlier mentioned things......God bless you.

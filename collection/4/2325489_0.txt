It is a simple form that you, your parents, and your employer need to fill out and sign.  You can go to your school district's office, your school office, your counselor to get the form.  In my area, it is basically an agreement that the employer will follow the labor laws concerning minors, and states your parents will allow you to work, and that you recognize the school takes priority over work.

always be alert to the traffic around you, it takes time to adjust but focus on the road in front of you and constantly look for traffic approaching you and going to pass, if your on a two lane find a place to pull over so you will not be nervous.  drive in the country for a while and get used to it, Remember semi- tractor trailers can not stop fast because of there weight. Be careful and don't drive fast. If you get nervous just find a place to stop off the road way.

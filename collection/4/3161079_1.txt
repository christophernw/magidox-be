Go to Benihana and watch closely when they make it.  There's no real trick.  If I remember right, the main ingredients are egg, rice, oil, onion, chicken, soy sauce.  I like to add some green onion at the end - don't cook the green onion though - it will lose its flavor.  You also have to fry the scrambled egg and cut it up before you add in the rice.. . Seriously though, just go to Benihana and take notes.  Ask them to do the volcano.  Good luck!

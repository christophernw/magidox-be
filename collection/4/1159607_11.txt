I can't tell you why she did it, but I know one thing... they airbrushed the S%$t out of those pictures. I have seen pics of her in a bikini and theres no way the girls body improved as the pregnancy progresses. I think she is trying to correct what the public thinks of her, shes trying to find her "adult' identity.

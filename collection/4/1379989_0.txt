It was invented long long ago by a cook who forgot the chocolate cream for the emperor in a cool place which was used as a fridge then.The emperor asked for his chocolate cream but since anyone didn't bring him his favorite dessert he went to the kitchen to find it himself and when he tasted the frozen chocolate cream he liked it so much and named it ice cream.Kings used to send their slaves to get ice from the mountains so they could keep their desserts cool.They threatened that they would kill them if they tell anyone about the "dessert of the Gods".. But the secret escaped like a snake from a mouses hole.. Everyone found out about the most delicious treat ever.. So centuries passed and now we have the most delicious flavors we desire, but in the beginning there were only three flavors: Vanilla,chocolate and strawberry.

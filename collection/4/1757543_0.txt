The problem with a lot of people in this country is that they have been so used to hearing only the liberal side of the news that when someone reports on the conservative side, they think that they are just some "right-wing whack job", instead of someone who is just giving the other side. Admittedly, there are some people on Fox News who only toe the Republican Party line, but the news reporters are doing what every other reporter on every other station should be doing: giving the news as it happens, without putting their spin or their opinion with it.

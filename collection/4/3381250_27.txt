Okay, you're 12 so I'll go easy on you.  I'm black and I love everybody.  I'm also educated and don't feel any animosity toward the "white man" for all that he put my forefathers through.  There are racist people in every race and they cannot represent the entire race itself.  Some black people are racist...just as some are drug dealers, angry at the world, killers, thieves and everything else.  But there are plenty of white people who are the same way.  A person is an individual, not just a race.

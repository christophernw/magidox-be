Hello???????? Prostitution irrelevant, not at all, ask anyone who has suffered the ills of it.  it is the decay of a society that is long gone uncontrolled and of course it will and this decay has caused a world wide epidemic where millions die of HIV, it is not irrelevant but of course the other issues you mentioned are definitely important, but u know government, if they take care of these things we will have a better life and they will have no sleep so they love making our lives miserable as best as they can, thats all

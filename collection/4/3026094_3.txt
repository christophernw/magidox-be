Why, the best defense is always a good offense! So cut 'em off, ram 'em, go around that annoying idiot as fast as you can, get in front of that slowpoke, tailgate excessively if you can't get around (him while making angry faces) pass him on the double yellow line and give rude gestures while doing so, always go through yellow lights, and above all, never, ever drive the speed limit unless you see a cop.

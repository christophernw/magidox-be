take some wood and build a frame  as big as you want it then cover every thing exept the roof with wire and cover all that exept the door and the bottom with wood so in the summer you can take the wood off and make it cooler tin is good for a roof if it is slanted to the back. . i live in nc to so i know the weather and i made a hutch like this for my 3 rabbits

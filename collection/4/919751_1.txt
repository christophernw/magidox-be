Because conservatives have nothing better to do than sit around reading books and putting up web sites about all kinds of crap, such as the website of Michael Savage, an idiot recommended by Mona above.  Not all conservatives are bad people, but how about the rest of them get off their butts and do something for a living?  I doubt there are many conservatives dying in Iraq so everyone else can sit at home watching the war on TV.

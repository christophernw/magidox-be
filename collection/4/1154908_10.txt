What kind of question is this?. . All kinds of people are oppressed - women, gays, overweight people, single people, old people, other minorities (not just blacks) are also oppressed (I could go on and on).  Around the turn of the 20th century, Irish, Polish, Italian immigrants to this country were oppressed, as Japanese were around the time of WWII and Muslims are now.. . Not all of these people can rise above their oppressors, nor can they all excel at what they try.  Good for those who can, though.

because Christianity is probably one of the most intolerant and tries it hardest to recruit members by any means necessary. you have missionary withholding foods to starving people if they choose not to change their faith. Remember the Crusades and the hundreds of thousands that were killed due to the forcing of a religion... how about the Inquisition... so much blood spilled for a religion that teaches that God loves all.

Skewness measures the extent to which the tails of the data may be more drawn out on one side than the other. A value is 0 or close to it indicates that the left and right-hand sides of the distribution are balanced. If the skewness is positive then the peak of the graph (the mode) is closer to the left hand side. In that instance, the mean value is greater than the median. If skewness is negative then the opposite is true: the mean is less than the median and the peak of the graph is moved to the right.

Wow, I did not know racism was this alive and well.  I was a child and I was present at this speech, I don't remember it the same way you kids do. The speech that I remember was one of hope, and a cry for people of all colors to accept one another.  He was realistic that his generation, may not see the fruits of his labor, but he was hopeful that his children would.  When he said that "he had a dream that his children would be known not by the color of their skin, but by their character", he was stating that racism would be a thing of the past, and that they would have to acheive by their merits.  He did not want things handed to them, with a false sense of entitlement, but rather they would be "allowed" to work for their dreams and not be held back.  I see that there is still racism, but we have made major improvements. When I was a child, de-segration in schools started, children of all colors started interacting together.  That is when the real boundries start to fall away, by allowing the children to make friends with one another, because that is when we are innocent and do not  know that we " shouldn't get along or that the races are not the same "; we just see another kid or a new friend. Now the races mingle freely with one another, they can be friends, marry, and have children.  I think the next generation of children will do a lot to breaking down racial barriers.  We have more children that are bi-racial, and they will be the ones to bring forth more change. I look forward to these changes.

Bladder infections can be caused by numerous things (sex, holding urine too long, bacteria).  The only way to get rid of it is to take antibiotics.  Go see your doctor.  Cranberry juice only works to help keep the urinary tract healthy.  It will not cure a bladder infection.  But this is something that can be very serious b/c it can lead to a kidney infection (which can kill you), so make sure you see your doctor.

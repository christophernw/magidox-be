I honestly think it wasn't the Russian government, but most likely some sort of Russian crime association (Russian Mafia perhaps..) Think about this:. . After the fall of the Soviet Union. . -What happened to all the KGB agents?. . -Where did all the nuclear technology go?. . Simply put, the Russian government is not powerful enough to have done this, I'm guessing an old colleague of the spy who was better off with the said spy dead.

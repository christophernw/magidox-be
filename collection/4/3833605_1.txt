wow, that's a toughie.  i don't know how the backgrd checks work in terms of applying to schools because i know they're strict re: people convicted of child endangerment/neglect; sexual abuse; etc.  Murder II conviction though...hmmm...u might be best putting this dream off later until u clear your record?  BUT, keep in mind, i don't even know if that's possible, because i know certain offenses stay on your record.  talk w/a lawyer about whether it's expungeable and if so, what is the time table.  if it's expungeable, then this is the point in time, u can try and become a preschool teacher.

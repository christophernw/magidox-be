What I do before I put them up outside the home -- is that I, right after I take a shower (and while the bathroom is still warm and moist) hang the newly purchased icicle lights over the shower curtain rod -- and let them stay in there overnight. . . The moisture and heat in the bathroom does most of the trick of straightening out the bends that are present from packaging.

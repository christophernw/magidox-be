The only way to truly get rid of the toothache is, of course, to see your dentist.  If it's money that's keeping you from getting the care you need, then locate a dental school that is near you and contact them about getting your tooth taken care of.  The students always need patients to work on and the fee will be very reasonable (and should be affordable).  To get temporary relief, the best thing you can do is take 800 mg of Ibuprofen which is prescription strength... it has an anti-inflammatory in it so it's going to work better than Tylenol or aspirin because it will ease the pulp (nerve) of the tooth.  Just make sure you get this taken care of as soon as possible... an infection in a tooth that is left untreated could land you a vacation in a hospital or even death in some cases.

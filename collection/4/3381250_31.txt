Hey. don't sweat all the racist junk.  That race card is played out anyways.  Just base your friends on who you are and what you like.  People end up racist when they don't think.  Some people are raised that way, some have bad experiences... you never know.  The only way to get around a racist is to not get offended and just be cool with them.  If you don't give them a reason to hate you or put you down then what can they say?  They get confused and hopefully that will get them to think a little.   . P.S. it's not just black people that fall into that hole.

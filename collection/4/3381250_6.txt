I will say that they are not all racist... I will get that out there right off the bat so I don't step on anyone's toes!  I think that all races are made up of their share of racist people.  I think a lot of it comes from people that are insecure.  Some of it could even come from people that are afraid of people of other races and different cultures.  Most of it comes from the way that they were raised.  Some, NOT ALL, blacks have anger toward the whites because our fourfathers brought them to the states.  It's hard to explain to them that the whites of the current living generations did not have a hand in it, but that's all they know and believe because it is all they have been taught.  Same concept as- some whites feel that the blacks only cause problems.  Most feel that way because that is all they have been taught.. I will just say, I am not biased or racist... if anyone is wondering... that's only my theory of why people are the way they are.

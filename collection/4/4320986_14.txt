I'm an atheist and this question tells me you really know nothing about what an atheist is.. . It's a person who is just like everybody else, wants the same things, loves their families, helps society, likes to have fun, get married, etc, etc. etc.. . The only difference is....THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD.

It's true that the origins are pagan but it's extremely important to understand that ALL religions, when they spread, INTENTIONALLY incorporate existing rituals and symbols because people are comfortable with them.  A new religion then reinterprets the familiar rituals and symbols with the teachings/meaning of the new religon.  It's standard and it makes alot of sense -- e.g. if a new religion were to come to this country, the best thing to do would be to present it in the context of existing rituals and practices (spiritual and cultural).  It's important to understand that the original meaning is let go and the new meaning takes its place.

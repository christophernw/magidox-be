I couldn't agree more. It galls me to see a 50k car with "Wash Me" emblazoned in the dust on the vehicle. And I see it alot. I live in Vegas and alot of cash is in people's pockets here and they won't get a car wash. We do. We go once a week and get the whole thing cleaned. I refuse to ride around in a dumpy looking car like the last white trash. Hey everybody out there, when you come to Vegas you can laugh at all these rich jerkwater hillbillies with a Hummer (Hummers are very big here) that's covered in soot and some prankster has "Wash Me" written on it. It's a laugh riot to me. I could see it if it's Hillbilly Junction and people have no teeth, but this is supposed to be a classy city. It's not. If people think it is and they live here, then I know they have a crack pipe on them.

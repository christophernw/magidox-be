Quote. . "The difference between fundamentalist Christians and Muslims is what they hold as fundamental.. As a Christian I hold as fundamental that I love God and others. As Muslim fundamentalists, people seem to want to kill unbelievers.. As for those Christian fundamentalists who get a bit obsessed about politics (this coming from someone doing it at Uni) and preaching hate against pro abortion and gay people they are not being true to the fundamentals of the Christian faith.". . to find out what people "seem" to think read their books and talk to them, don't just listen to the media and perpetuate false information.. . . ***Christian fundamentalists *** try and stick to the "fundamentals"  of Christianity (love god, don't hurt people basically). . ***Christian extremists *** go to one extreme or another - there is the "I don't have to go to church, pray, tell the truth, be nice to people" Christianity is about what is in your heart extreme... there is also the "I'm going to kill people in the name of religion (eg IRA) preach hate and delude myself that this is what God wants" extreme.. . . ***Muslim fundamentalists*** try and stick to the "fundamentals"  of Islam (love god, don't hurt people basically). . ***Muslim extremists*** go to one extreme or another - there is the "I don't have to go to the mosque, pray, tell the truth, be nice to people" Islam is about what is in your heart extreme... there is also the "I'm going to kill people in the name of religion (eg Al-Qaida) preach hate and delude myself that this is what God wants" extreme.. . Sticking to the fundementals of a religion is good. There is not a religion on this earth that doesn't teach to respect greater powers than you and strive to help your fellow man.. . Extremism in anything (religion, diet, handwashing, clubbing, tattooting, keeping cats or whatever floats your boat) is bad for you.. . Whatever religion (or none) you claim to follow.... . 1) how many people have you smiled at today?. 2) how many times today have you asked someone how they are because you were interested in the answer?. 3) how many lies have you told?. 4) how many times have you let out a car in front of you?. 5) how many times have you lost your temper?. 6) have you given more in chaity this year than you have spent on sweets, CDs and computer games?. . answer honestly and to only yourselves.

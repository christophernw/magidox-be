they are not smart people, people who we will need for the small tasks that make our lives so vaulable, like dishwashers and gas station clerks and fast food workers. I thank god there are so many dumb people out there, cause when i want 2 taco's extra sour cream at 2am, there they are in the window making them for me. Cheers to all you dummies

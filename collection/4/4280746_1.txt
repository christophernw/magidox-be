Even though I am an Atheist and usually would applaud an something like this I disagree with you, and only because we all have a choice to make when it comes to believing in a Supreme Being or saying F*ck it I don't believe any of it.  I would assume that you think that religious people are misguided, well I got news for you they think that very same thing about us but we shouldn't let something like that separate us because I know quite a few people that believe and are really cool people and I respect their choice as much as they respect mine.  Of course we usually don't get into religious conversations unless we feel the urge to argue but that is getting off the point.  The point is that today we have too many things that drive us apart from one another even when we like that other person.. . Religion of course being one of them, another big one is Political party which one and how extreme are you, Abortion again being one (of course the parties go along with this one sometimes).  When it all comes down to it why can't we all just try to get along instead of "GET THE F**K OUT OF MY FACE", and whatever else you can think of.  Anymore it seems people are looking for reasons to not like someone as opposed to looking for the good qualities in someone they could consider a friend.  I probably sound like some hippie crackpot with this ranting but I really don't think people need to judge one another based on one or two things that they believe that might be differing from what you believe.

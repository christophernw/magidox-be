If Israel wants peace, they must stop being so aggressive!  Their secret police are no better than terrorists with uniforms and U.S. funding.. . Folks also ought to recognize that each nation is completely entitled to its own ideas and opinions, no matter how abhorrent, so long as they do not use violence to impose their will upon others.  Iran and Palenstine's view that Israel has no right to exist, while easy to dislike, is a legitimate view which they have every right to hold.

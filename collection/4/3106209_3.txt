A large study of 80,000 men and women in Scandinavia in the 1970's uncovered the role of walking and other exercise in preventing colon cancer. Moderate recreational activity was enough to bring a 40% reduction in the risk of colon cancer among women. Only those men who were over 45 at the time of entry into the study clearly benefited from physical activity when it came to colorectal cancer. The theory is that walking, by speeding up the speed up the passage of ingested foods through the colon, gives less time for carcinogens in the food to be in contact with the intestinal lining. Cancer was most reduced for the beginning (proximal) portion of the colon, less for the end (distal) portion of the colon and little or no effect on rectal cancer risk.

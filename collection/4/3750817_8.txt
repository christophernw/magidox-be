Basically when your engine uses the petrol theres a vacuum and also the gas petrol creates is immense so when your tank is low there will be a certain degree of pressure and when you fill up you seem to be having to keep pressing the filler again and again but if you put the nozzle in and out a few times that should do the trick if not be patient and press the filler slowly and it should work.

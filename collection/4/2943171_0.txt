I'm a Southern European so wine is part of my culture. This has happened to me plenty of times, try pushing the cork in, instead of trying to pull it out.  If it's a regular wine bottle (either local or a standard import as opposed to a high-end import) the cork should be 35 mm long and pose no problem.

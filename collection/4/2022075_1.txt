The male seahorse has a pouch on its stomach in which to carry babiesâ€”as many as 2,000 at a time. The female aligns a long tube called ovipositor with the male's pouch. The eggs move through the tube into the male's pouch where he then fertilises them. A pregnancy lasts from 10 to 25 days, depending on the species and water conditions.. . The reproductive process begins when a male and a female seahorse do daily pre-dawn dances, intertwining their tails and swimming together. Eventually they engage in a true courtship dance, which can last as long as eight hours. It ends with the female depositing her eggs in the male's pouch. . When the male gives birth he pumps his tail until the baby seahorses emerge.

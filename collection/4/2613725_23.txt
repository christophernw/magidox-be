Go out and look at the Sky, the stars, the rivers, the mountains, the animals and other people. This world simply SCREAMS!!! God.   If you were in the desert and you found a watch, even if you didnt know what a watch was, simply by looking at it  you would know that it had been made and didnt occur on its own. Same thing with this world.. . And by the way, God isnt hiding, your just not looking. He is closer to you than your own jugular vein!. . I hope this helps,. . Kindest regards,. Paul...

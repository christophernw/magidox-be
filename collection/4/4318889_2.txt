We take the SAME classes they do, just chose a different career path.. . So often meteorologists with the National Weather Service are "glorified".... and we are "kicked to the curb"..... and what we say is discarded.. . -By the Way-. FYI: "We" are called "On-Air Meteorologists.". . . Sorry if I got a little carried away..... . Weather_Wise911

Try taking a brush and brushing them with diluted alum.  You can get alum anywhere.  It works on railings, furniture, door jams, and (speaking from awful chewing experience) house siding.  You can get it at any grocery store, it won't hurt the dog or your belongings at all. (unless its something that can't get wet)

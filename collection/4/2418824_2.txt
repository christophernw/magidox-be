The rockets the shuttle uses for maneuvering in space have a specific impulse Isp of about 300 seconds. In simple terms, what that means is that burning 1 lb of propellant produces 300 lb-sec of impulse. Another interpretation is that the exhaust speed of the rockets is is Isp * g, or 300*32=9600 ft/sec. . In contrast, the waste water is ejected at a low speed, only about 30-75 ft/sec (ref.), and it only lasts a short time. So a water dump will only induce small unwanted angular and translational rates which are barely noticable. And, as other answerers have noted, the closed-loop attitude control system keeps the Shuttle within a small deadband of the desired attitude. The primary jets have a nominal thrust of 870 lb and the verniers 24 lb.. Other disturbances on the Shuttle have the potential to tax the attitude control system more severely. One of the major possibilities is Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) contingency venting, which would only be performed in case of a leak in the APU's fuel system. In this situation APU exhaust is vented as a gas, with several lb thrust which may persist for many minutes.

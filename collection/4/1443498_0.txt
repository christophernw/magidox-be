SLR stands for "Single-lens Reflex".  It's a way of constructing a camera so that when the photographer looks through the viewpiece, they are actually looking through the lens of the camera and can see how the photo will be framed.  The viewpiece on other kinds of cameras will be slightly off from the actual photo that will be taken.

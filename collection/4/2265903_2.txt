Tell them you have put yourself on the "DO NOT CALL" list and any further calls will be reported to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and that they will be subjected to fines if there are anymore calls.  Then go to your phonebook or online and get yourself on the list. IT works they have to comply, keep a  phonelog by your phone in case they don't and record every call with date time message etc

black mold can kill a person with no asthma. so have a professional remove it for you.. DO NOT TOUCH IT OR TRY TO REMOVE IT YOURSELF!!. and get your grandmother out of the mobile home.. With her advanced age and the fact she has asthma would put her at risk EVEN if you have the mold moved professionally.. She needs a new place to live.

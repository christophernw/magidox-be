Ditch her. If she doesn't respect you and your beliefs and wishes, she is not a good friend.. . She's just trying to save souls so she gets the tower rooms in Heaven. I mean, who wants the lousy ground floor ones with no view?. . EDIT- Trisha sounds like a real jackass. Tell your friend that if she's going to preach at you, you're going to preach at her. And do it. Keep pulling out stuff from your religion and see how she reacts.

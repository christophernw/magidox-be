I was raised Catholic and I am offended! Just Kidding! I was raised Catholic though. I slept through most of it. It is very ritual oriented. It works for them I suppose. My grandmother was Catholic to the bone. I doubt very seriously she's in Hell for it. God probably told her that was close enough. He's a funny guy, that God!

Well I had that same problem with one of my cats. He was all matted up and you couldn't brush him because he would bite you. So I had to take him in and have him shaved. Then the groomer told me that he had a weird kind of hair that it was going to keep growing in knots so I had to take him in to the groomer every 2-3 months. He didn't look all that cute but we loved him anyway. The other cat was scared of him at first but he got used to it.

There is no real correlation between two.  . . The fact is people want what they cannot afford, so they borrow to live beyond their means.  Materialism has its price, and for most, it is way too high.. . The real disaster is going to occur later when the spenders need to keep earning money into old age and will never be able to retire (if anyone is still willing to employ them).  Can you say "lower standard of living."

Do you mean "take the High Road."  To me it means, if given the choice, take the road that is morally correct.  An example, if you find a wallet with a lot of money in it, you have the choice of either keeping the money for yourself or trying to find the rightful owner in order to return it to him.  If you do the later, you are taking the high road.. However, if you are really asking about the "Hight" road, then I confess I do not know what that means.

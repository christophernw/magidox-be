Humans could not parachute out of a comercial airliner.the average speed of the plane is about 300 to 500 miles an hour so you would be torn to pieces, not a pretty sight .Comercial airliners fly at an average altitude of 30,000 ft. the air is so thin at that altitude that the average person wouldn't survive,not to mention that you would probably freeze to death at that height in your street clothes. the average civilian is also not trained to parachute out of any plane not to mention a Jet.could you imagine a plane full of pannicked people ,untrained and unprepared jumping out of that plane . Isure dont. Hey Maybe that would make the next great disaster movie Just remember i've got dibbs

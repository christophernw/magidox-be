People need to focus on their own salvation but we should be aware of whats going on around us. Its a fine line. If I was in a restaurant and I was about to drink a poisoned drink and you knew it I would really appreciate you telling me before I put it up to my mouth.  After you help me, go back to your meal.  Thats my deal.

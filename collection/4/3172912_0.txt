I was not totaly clear with the question, but if I'm not mistaken your asking about the remote for the keyless entry syteme and the buttons working and not working. If this is the case most likely that the contacts are not making well contact so I would take it to a sealer ship and allow them to look. They will tell you whats wrong and not chrage you without permission.

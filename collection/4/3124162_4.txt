I got this problem too!!! When i was 12, I had to surgery one time, but it did not get away.  So my grandma friend showed me that anytime that "If you get hurt, you have to put the hot handtowel in your forhead.  Continuing until change another warm towel when it gets cold"  It worked for me. I hope it will work for you, and also you'll get well soon.

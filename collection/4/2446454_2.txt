this is an interesting question so we should try to answer it to our best and not condemn. sex urge originates from our brain but what causes our brain to develop the urge in the first place? i believe the urge to have sex is built into us when we are born so that we can pro-create. also sex is design to have a nice feeling so that we want to have sex and not hate it. that is why sometimes sex is abused.

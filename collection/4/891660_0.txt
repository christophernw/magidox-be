You really need to contact Canada Customs and Immigration.  This is not a question that can be very easily answered here as we don't know enough information about your case.  YOu probably need to make contact with Canadian Immigration authorities by phone and talk to a real person - if your command of English is not the best, have someone with you who understands English, or French, very well.. . Good luck with it.

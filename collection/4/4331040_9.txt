American society is a decadent society and somewhat out of balance with itself. The outlook and goals of America is so focused in on itself and tragically uncommitted to using its influence to create a better world for all. It is a strange world where the majority of poeple do not have clean running water and a small minority have so much (junk) food that they are eating themselves to early graves.

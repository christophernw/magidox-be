Israel has never confirmed they have them. They have never tested them in the open. There is allot of speculation that they have them. Nothing that has been confirmed beyond all doubt. We think they have them. However ... consider this, by not admitting they have them, and by not testing them, and never really quelling the rumor they have them, doesn't that suspicion that they might have them create the effect of a deterrent? It is call "bluffing.". . As to Iran, we suspect that if they have them, they will probably use them. We suspect that their goal is to become a nuclear armed nation. In the recent EU proposals to Iran, they were offer a working non-breeder reactor; Iran refused the offer. They want the bomb. . . Question for one of your responders: If our use of "the bomb" against the Japanese was terrorism what do you call the attack on Pearl harbor on December 7, 1941. I am sure that the difference means nothing to you, but are you aware that Japan has still not apologized or acknowledged to China the atrocities which they committed? Please learn a little history before you start throwing stones.

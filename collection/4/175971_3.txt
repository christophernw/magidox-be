It is very honorable that you take your position so seriously. I have to say that your friend is mistaken. The Bible is very clear on what God requires of us. We also have the example of how Jesus lived his life. If you are looking for scriptural references here are a few that are very plain and clear about unacceptable behaviors: 1st Corinthians 6:9, 10; Galatians 5:19-21; Colossi ans 3:5. You can access free information entitled "What Does God Require of Us?" It addresses topics such as family life, conduct, attitude towards others, how to draw close to God in prayer, etc. As for what you CAN do you are already on the right track by wanting to be pleasing to God. Without prejudice I hope you will consider looking at the web page below. There is also a free 195 page book called; "Questions Young People Ask, Answers that Work" you can request it without obligation. It addresses things such as dating, marriage, family life, how to get and keep a job. It is very helpful.

marketing.. same reason why people will think jack daniels is only a drink for low class blue collar white people.. and as an after thought,as marketing seems determined to market for 'whites' or 'blacks' or 'gays' or Christians',can we maybe begin to wonder why bigotry and racism won't die out?. as long as people are separated and classified then they will never become whole and simply humans.

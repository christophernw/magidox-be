Because man puts words in God's mouth. Just like you see in this section everyone has their own interpretation of the bible. Therefore if it does not say, then don't add to it. God look at your heart if you truly love Him, its not by what we do or don't do whether we overeat, overdrink, overeact, overdo whatever the case may be. Bottomline God looks at our hearts not our actions.

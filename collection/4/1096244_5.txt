I get that too!! It drives me insane!!. . ITs allergies to do with the pathways between the ear and the mouth... Just behind the ear there is patch which gets blocked when you are ill. When you sneeze it inflames it and make it itch.. . I have tried absolutely everything to try and get rid of this.. and the best stuff is a homeopathic remedy called: Wyethia.. . You suck 3 tabs a day and it stop it!!

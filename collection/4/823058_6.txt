Observe carefully. On any given day, does everyone have an aversion to you? Who are you paying attention to and who are you discounting? Why? Maybe the people you are discounting feel you have an aversion to them. Selective perception, my dear. What is most important is that you do not have an aversion for who you are allowing yourself to be. When you love yourself, you will attract love.

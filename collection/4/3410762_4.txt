15,000,000 Now let me understand something . The ships were small after looking this up the average ship could hold approx 150 people. So you are saying 100,000 boats are sunk between africa and their destination.. According to history only 500,000 slaves were ever brought to this country between 1619 and 1818 .. African slaves were usually sold to European traders by powerful coastal or interior states in exchange for European goods, such as textiles and firearms. Africans were very rarely kidnapped by Europeans because they could not penetrate the interior. The danger of fatal disease was ever-present and the coastal areas were dominated by powerful warrior kingdoms. Such was the kingdom of Dahomey one of whose kings was reputed to have an income 5 times that of the most wealthy British Duke from selling his fellow Africans. The kings of Dahomey sold their war captives into transatlantic slavery, who otherwise would have been killed in a ceremony known as the Annual Customs. . As coastal and near-coastal nation states in Africa expanded through military conflicts, the captives of these wars, usually civilians but sometimes defeated warriors, were enslaved and sold. Collection of slaves was sometimes a basis for warfare but more often than not, enslavement was simply a by-product of war. Slavery had been a staple of African political life long before the coming of Europeans. Conviction of a crime was another way to become a slave. Since most if not all of these nations did not have a prison system, criminal slaves were usually sold..   So you are saying your ancestors would have been better off dead by this mans hands .Than slaves in this country to be your ancestors here so you can complain. .  Research your facts and history before you state facts next time.. Also it is according to historical facts only 12 million slaves were ever rounded up and shipped from Africa to be dispersed all over the world.

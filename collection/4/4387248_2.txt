Sorry I'm overseas and can't help you with that one.  But I would like to say, I am constantly hearing words in songs that just don't go together.  For the longest time I thought the Spice Girls were singing about spam!. . And you don't want to hear what I hear in country or rap music.  I do believe I have dyslexic ears.  :-)

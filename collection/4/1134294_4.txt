I think it is because men like porn and they like porn because they like to sit around and do nothing and get hard ons and this combines two all time favorites. They like to watch passively while women do all the work - this is entertaining for them. Women have better imaginations when it comes to sex and entertain themselves better so we don't get into porn that much. This is why men like girl on girl but women don't get turned on by guy on guy. Also women are emotionally sensitive and see its all fake and that ruins it for us. Guys don't care. They like fake.

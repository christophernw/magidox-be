Other options were tried but Names worked best.. They were called by the city they hit and the date.. That got confusing where the same city would be hit multiple times and perhaps in the same season.. . They used to be storm numbers and letters ... storm A, B, C, They retired them when a big storm hit.. After a while they started running out of combinations So memorable mens names were used.. Then to accomodate the non male community... Man and female names were alternated.

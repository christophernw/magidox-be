Is she all dead?  Maybe they have found useful parts.  I would call in the Mayor of Munchkin Land and have him get the coroner to declare her "not merely dead, but truly and sincerely dead.". . If it's just from the neck up, she will be indistiguishable from many of the others, so they can realistically hope to get away with it.

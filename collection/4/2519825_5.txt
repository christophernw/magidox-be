I'm not a published writer as of yet...but I am an aspiring writer. It's my dream to write something or many things/books that people will enjoy and remember. I long for the respect and recognition that comes with being an excellent writer and I have always communicated far better in writing. I love the written word and I love to read. I hope to one day write a book (s) that will inspire and influence others and bring great satisfaction to me, as well...along with earning a decent living at doing something I love and want to share with the world.

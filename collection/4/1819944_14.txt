Personally I welcome the chance to debate my religious belief with not only people of different faiths but non-believers as well. This not only helps them to possibly understand and appreciate my views and vice versa, but it also helps my views to evolve into something more solid and true to me. It helps me to tear down the barriers between my potential understandings of my place in the universe but also to remake those views when I realize my understandings are no longer valid. For me I strongly agree with the words of John Donne when he said that “No man is an island, entire of itself...any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.”

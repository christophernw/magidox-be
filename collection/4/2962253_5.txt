I completely understand your sentiment.. . Other CHRISTmas songs:. . Hark the Herald, Angels Sing. O Little Town of Bethlehem. Who's Child Is This?. We Three Kings. Go Tell It On the Mountain. . The lyrical resonance of these songs combined with music will definitely get you into the true spirit of Christmas. Pax et Bonum!!

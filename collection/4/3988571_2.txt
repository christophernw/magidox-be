Trial and error is my method.... at least since I learnt that consequence was unimportant.. . Its not exactly easy for me since I'm Aspergian... I used to try to watch people interacting and observe common behaviour patterns, then try to emulate them.... but I never got the full story, always got it wrong... and it just confused me.. . These days instead I just say and do whatever the sweet heck I feel like, and take mental note to change it if I witness people being visibly offended who I don't want to be (or remember to repeat it if I WANT them to be offended).

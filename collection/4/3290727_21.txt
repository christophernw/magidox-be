Good luck with that one.  I would suggest you go and buy an inexpensive slipcover and cover it altogether.  I had JUST ordered my new furniture (after the very old furniture was SHREDDED to the wood from the last batch of kitties) when SURPRISE -- pregnant cat finds me!!!  I've thrown slipcovers over my nice new furniture.  I'd rather have it intact and not be able to see it than have shredded furniture for another 15 years!

I'm not sure if this applies to you but at one point when I started exercising more I would "reward" myself with food. I would say to myself, "now that I'm working out more, I can eat more."  Not true.  To really see weight loss results, you have to change your diet as well.. . It's a lot easier to avoid a 200 calorie candy bar than it is to burn 200 calories on the treadmill.

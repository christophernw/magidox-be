sounds silly but have you tried to stick your fingers in your ears. a hiccup is your diaphragm contracting and if youn stick your fingers in your ears it has something to do with the air pressure. something like if your are travelling down a big hill and your ear stops up so you yawn. just a thought you are probably desperate and this sometimes works for me.  good luck

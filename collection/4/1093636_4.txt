As someone else said, maybe they're just tired, or not used to flying, or hoping that they won't get forced to do it.. . Not only that, it can be hard to get a tray until you get right up to the metal-detector and sometimes you may have to wait for one, so it can make it harder for people to have their things ready in tray because of that.  Also, people are probably already lugging their carry-on, and may have a hard time holding their bag, shoes, laptop, purse, jacket, tray, etc. all at once without having to set it all down and then pick it all back up everytime the line moves, which also takes time.

Politics are wierd if most people who voted for him knew who he really was, I think they would either abstain from voting or change their vote, but then again Bush could probably feast on fried kittens and puppies his whole life and his supporters would still probably worship him, shows you what a bunch of spin and lies, a war, and fear can do to a person when they vote.

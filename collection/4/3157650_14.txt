1.  Good health and long life for my children &     grandchildren (SELF EXPLANATORY). . 2. Win the lottery (TO BE ABLE TO GIVE MONEY TO MY CHURCH & GIFTS TO PEOPLE IN NEED, AND NOT WORRY HOW TO BUY A GALLON OF GAS). . 3. Graduate top of my class from college (SO I COULD HAVE A FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT)

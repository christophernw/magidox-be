do it like philosophers do it. sit in a drak room, close your eyes and try to figure out what in that instant you can say is SURE/ CERTAIN. you will come to the conclusion that the only thing you can say surely exists is the fact that you are currently thinking. cogito ergo sum - I think therefore I am!

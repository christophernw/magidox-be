You can't. The stuff in a can doesn't really do much. All decent name brand gasoline's have had better cleaners in them than you get from pep Boys for ten years now. The best thing is to stay away from generic gas. To clean really dirty injectors they have to be removed and put on a machine that keeps them open while sending cleaner through at high pressure.

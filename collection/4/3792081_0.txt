It's kind of how stereotypes get started. Especially in certain settings most people may know (or know of) more scary black people than they do nice friendly ones.  I confess I am guilty of this.  I have only had like 2 black friends.  Not because I don't like them...I just don't know any.  So I am guily of being a little on edge in certain parts of town.  I shouldn't, but I do.

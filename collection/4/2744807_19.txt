How do you know anything?  If you read any book you don't really know if it's true.  You have to decide if you will believe it.  Of course it's possible that jesus is real and it's possible that jesus was not real.  The great thing is that you get to decide.  Even if he was real it's possible that the stories in the bible might or might not be completely true.  You are the big decision-maker here.

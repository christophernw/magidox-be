My suggestion would not to study something that you don't like.  Why are you going into something you don't like?  If you have to force yourself so much, then maybe it's not for you...  . . But if you are looking for motivation, gather with a group of friends for study sessions.  It helps when you have someone that is pushing you to do it.

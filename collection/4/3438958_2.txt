If you are not willing to volunteer, chances are they cannot use you.  Most of the suicide prevention bureaus are staffed with volunteers, with maybe a professional social worker or psychologist on staff to train and assist them.  They have tiny budgets and cannot afford to pay people.  The ones with larger budgets, as in big cities, will sometimes create staff positions which are then given to long-time volunteers who get into financial difficulties and cannot continue to help them unless they have a salary.  But they are already volunteers.

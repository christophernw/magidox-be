The only Muslims I have come across are full of "Hate" for their fellow man; Loise Farrakhan..called Jews dogs of the earth. We see daily Muslims rioting against Israel and America. They want to kill anyone who doesn't agree with the. Koran and it's teaching, especially about Mohammad. I think there are moderate Muslims that live in peace with their neighbors and cause no harm..but then there is the radical Muslims who hate Jews and Americans. We see this type of radical thinking in most of the worlds religions except for Judaism. I think the best things Muslims can do is to ask for the forgiveness of their murder and crimes against Israel..then the world can begin to forgive them for the evil they have done...Peace!

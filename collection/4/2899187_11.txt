I just love tea from whittard.  They have such a great variety.  I love ´Indian Spiced Tea`.  It´s such a warming tea with cardamom, cloves and cinnamon.  I drink it and it reminds me of Christmas.  If I´m feeling less Christmasy I drink ´Vanilla Flavour tea` it´s a delicate tea, very refreshing.  I have to say though, my all time favourite has to be ´Tetley`.  There´s no better to tea to drink first thing in the morning.  It gets rid of that horrible mouth fuzz and rehydrates you.

I think Caballera has the right idea.  Humans and other life evolved on Earth because the conditions for life happened to be appropriate at that moment in evolution.  Humans have adapted to life on Earth.  The conditions on the moon including lack of air, water and gravity are not conducive to life that developed on Earth.  . . As a result of the human brain being highly evolved we are able to visit the moon by artificial means and possibly terraform it so that the conditions are suitable for life in the future.

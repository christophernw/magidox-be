I can relate to your problem. I was also shy growing up, but gained a lot of confidence everytime I was sure about what I was saying. I am currently working on an e-book to share my experiences and to give other people like you hope and advice. Check my site: http://www.public-speaking-solutions.com/fear-of-public-speaking.html . . I also share a lot of tips and inspiration with my subscribers, so I think it will be nice if you subscribed to my free newsletter.

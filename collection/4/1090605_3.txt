If you whiten your teeth the teeth will get whiter but, not the bonding.  If this is what you want try crest white strips or anything else at wal-mart. They are the same as what you get from a dentist just weaker formula. Oh, I used to work in a dental office 5.5yrs so I know.  Feel free to email me if you have more questions.

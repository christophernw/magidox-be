A trick I learned long ago is take a empty can from cat food put a plastic top you would use to save leftover food or rubber band some plastic wrap over the top. Put some nuts or bolts in it. Keep it near a place you can grab it. When the cat does something wrong shake it a little to scare the cat. After awhile the cat will stop whatever it was. It does work! and no water all over and not harmful to kitty. I used it when my cat launched herself on the closed screen door and ripped the screen. After about 3 ot 4 times she got the idea. I tired water, it just made her wet, and water marks in the dust on the screen. . Or keep him or her in a seperate area away from furniture when your away with food N water and a potty.

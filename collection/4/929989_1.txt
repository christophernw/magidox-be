Everyone gave good advice on stopping the bleeding. In the future I would suggest to get a nail file and just file on them not to trim them but the file will stimulate the part that is going too far down the nail causing you to snip it. When the nails are stimulated by a file or running on asphalt this will encourage that part to shrink up farther so you won't accidently cut it.

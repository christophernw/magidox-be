no one cares where you live or what you drive i bet you make your money by laying on a bed and spreading your legs. i hope anyone that reads my comment looks at her other question in pregnancy saying that she pregnant with a black baby and that it is going to have nappy hair and that's it's a monkey. how can anyone respect you or where you live or anything about you if you respect yourself

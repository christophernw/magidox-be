The addition of ethanol in gasoline fuel in small amounts (10%-ish) will boost the octane level of the gasoline while doing little to nothing to the efficiency. It is also proported to help the gasoline burn a little cleaner and reduce emissions.. The lastest thing is to use high percentage ethanol (85%). The fuel acts a little differently, so the car you use it in need to be capable of handling the different fuel charge. Generally, these high ethanol content fuels burn cleaner then the normal gasoline, but the heating value of the mix is lower, so you don't get as much energy out of the fuel (use more fuel). The jury is out as to whether the cost vs. fuel efficiency will work out favorably. Also some questions about availability of ethanol production and distributio

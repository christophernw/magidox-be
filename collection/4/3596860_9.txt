The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob gave to Moses a memorial name to call Him by. In hebrew the letters are Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey.. . "Jehovah" came around by tow things. First the application of the vowels from the hebrew word "Adonai" and second, German translators using those vowels and sounding out a possible word. Unfortunately both are wrong.. . Even though the translation is wrong, its who gets the translation out to the public first that gets remembered. Because rabbis have made the Jewish people forget how to pronounce the name of God, there wasn't anyone around to correct the mistranslation. The result is the use we see today.. . Over the years many have tried to find the true way of pronouncing His memorial name, but all have failed. The problem being that who ever translates either focuses on one trait, or maybe two, but ignore the basics of hebrew speech and other clues in history.. . In short, "Adonai" was used because it has three syllables like God's name. Jospehus wrote that God's name was three vowels, there were no consonants. They also forget that the Vav used had three sounds, the usual 'v' sound but also two vowel sounds - 'o' as in 'go', and 'oo' as in 'moo'.. . I have given enough clues for people to figure out the proper way of pronouncing His holy name, but knowing the nature of people, nobody would be interested.

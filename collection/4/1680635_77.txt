The custom originated with the first cook who was late preparing the main meal. The custom is continued nowadays in restaurants that serve you bread or soup because what you ordered is going to be late coming. When Mom offers you "something to drink while dinner is being prepared, honey", she is saying in a loving way "Dinner's going to be late because I lost track of the time, baby. Sorry. I'll make it up with a great dessert."

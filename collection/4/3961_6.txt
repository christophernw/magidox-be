You might have to move the litterbox back in, just for the meantime. Put it back in his spot, and then gradually move it so he's going somehwere else. Pretty soon THAT will be his spot so when you remove the litterbox to the grate he'll go there. It might take time - but it'll be worth it in the end not to have your floor all yucky. Good luck!

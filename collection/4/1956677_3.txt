Motivation generally FOLLOWS action, not the other way around. When a person feels or sees a "reward" for behaviour  (work, exercise, etc) , it motivates to repeat the action in one way or another. Fear and Love are the greatest motivators as you likely know.  Fear will make any reasonable person perform every time, and Love does not need explanation.

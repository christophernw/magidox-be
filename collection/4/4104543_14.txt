I do look at things differently.  I think workaholics never really change though.  I try not to be a workaholic though LOL.  I am not as driven but am still anxious at times and I don't like how my body has changed (the pull of gravity).  Then I think this is happening to all the other people my age too and I don't feel so alone!

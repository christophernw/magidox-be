yes...it has something to do with looks...you say you would never see a cute guy with an over weight women. but same vise versa...why are you looking for that cute guy,go look for the over weight one that is funny and tells jokes...  nobody really understands it's not that the skinny girl gets the worm...it's just a matter of fact that you see over weight people and first thing you think is why don't they do something about it... why don't they take care of themselves. I'ts a health issue.....yes i am skinny ...very skinny...but i was a big girl once and all my family are big girls....it's unhealthy and that's my only reason for thinking about it. i want my mom to be around for a long time. i don't want her to die from something that she could have prevented. and plus if they don't look at you ...they are just not interested.... it would be sad to think that everyone that look at you should want to be with you....maybe that guy likes to be with a girl who doesn't sit and worry herself with problems about other people. and if girls stay with guys no matter how they treat them...guys can do it too. some guys like that bytchy type...or the temptress, or a girl who makes sure she looks good and take care of herself.  what ever he likes he's going for it... I am sure if you had a choice you would go for the 6'3'  205lb nice looking guy with muscles  than the 5'6"inch 350lb guy that tells jokes and read the t.v.guide.  There are plenty of guys that like heavier women and vise versa...if it's that much of a concern...just wear a T-shirt or a sign on your head saying  "i am a smart and funny girl... i like walks in the parks, and dancing. . I just see this so much and if you would think about it yourself you would do the same as that guy your talking about,and if you say that only heavier women would put their lives on the line for their men...you are one shallow person....

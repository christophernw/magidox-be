Males can be more difficult because they try to be the top dog or alpha male. Be stern with your commands and consistant. The number one problem people have is that if there is more than 1 person in the house both people don't react the same when they train the dog. Be firm consistant and loving when they do the right thing. Dogs both male and female have a strong desire to please their masters. I train and install invisible dog fences. I have yet to meet a dog that did not listen to me. I do not react if they growl at me but instead use a warm tone until I win them over. The dog don't sense fear so the see me as the ALPHA male and submit. Remember Firm consistant training will always work over yelling and abuse a happy dog is a good dog.

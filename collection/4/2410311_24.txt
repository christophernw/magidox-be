"It is done...as you believe." --The Christ.. . No one as far as I know, believes strongly enough to grow a limb.  But there may be masters of ancient Eastern teachings who can, or at least have come close...it is belief, do you see?  If the belief is not strong, it will not happen.  . . The Christ said we could say to a mountain, "Get up, and move", and it would get up and move.  But even though I am convinced that he was speaking literally, I do not have enough belief to make a mountain move.  . . Rather than deny God because I can't move a mountain, I just realize that it has to do with levels of belief.  Everything in physical reality is about belief.

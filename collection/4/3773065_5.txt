Peace is the absence of conflict.  If you "look," your mind is in conflict.  Someone did not sneak into your room while you were sleeping and do this to you.  In order to find peace, you must get to know your own mind well enough, not by analysis but by observing or listening.  When you can see that all the conflict inside your mind is self inflicted and unnecessary, it will end and you have peace.  There is no other cure.

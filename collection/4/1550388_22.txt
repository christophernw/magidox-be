The people of Germany felt that the Jewish people were crippling their businesses, as the Jewish were rich jewellers they lent money to people and os got interest back and made money (a lot of today's banks have Jewish roots). Hitler had become wise to the people of Germany's feelings and to come to power as leader of the Nazi party one of his policies was to help the German people's businesses healthy again, he didn't exactly specify how until the people had voted him the leader and thus the holocaust followed up.

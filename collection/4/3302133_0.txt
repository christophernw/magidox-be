John Swift`s modest proposal was wriiten in response to English attitude to the Irish It was not intended to be taken as a serious suggestion.. Swift almost defines satire in this biting and brutal pamphlet in which he suggests that poor (catholic) Irish families should fatten up their children and sell them to the rich (protestant) land owners, thus solving the twin problems of starving children and poverty in one blow. So the irony of this proposal was when it was published in 1729 Swift was quickly attacked, and even accused of barbarity...... the exact state of the Proposal was written to expose. SATIRE. Although satire is usually witty, and often funny, this humour is more often than not tempered by passion and anger, even righteous fury. IRONY. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony

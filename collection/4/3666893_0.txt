if you meant plus 4 its 20-3*2+4 then that equals 18.  When you type it all into your calculator you get 18 because in an equation with  different operations you always do multiplication first so 3*2 is 6 then 20-6=14 and 14+4=18 unless there was parentheses then it would be (20-3)*(2+4) in that case it would be (17)*(6)=102. So here is your two ways:. . WITHOUT Parentheses it= 18.                or. WITH Parentheses it= 102

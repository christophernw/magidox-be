Bill O'Reilly is an entertainer.  Not a good one, however.  He is not a news guy and he is definitely not a journalist.  He plays to his base.  He plays to the Fox base.  He knows what they want to hear.  The problem I have for this is that it is dangerous.  While he plays to his base, he neglects telling the truth.  People believe what he is saying and that is where the danger lies.

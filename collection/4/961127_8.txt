Science is a discipline designed to help humanity raise itself above the superstitions and errors of its past primitive thinking.  It is not always practiced perfectly, but it is a logical method and works reasonably well most of the time.. . I resent your insinuation that "true Christians"  ought to reject and "fight" science.  Not all followers of Christ follow the Bible mindlessly, some of us are proud of our God-given ability to think logically about things like evolution and human rights.. . Before you fight science, try to understand it.  It might suprise you.

You can eat as many times a day as you like... as long as you don't exceed the number of calories to maintain ideal weight. Some people recommend eating six times a day... that is, six smaller meals instead of three larger ones. That keeps a steady amount of fuel in your body so you don't have big "ups and downs" in your energy level.

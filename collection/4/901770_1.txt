The short answer is, no one knows for sure what triggers or can trigger an Ice Age. . . However, the Milankovitch Theory indicates that many if not all of the ice ages are closely related to variations in insolation due to tiny variations connected with various features of celestial mechanics. Some of these changes are so subtle that it is not clear how they could be responsible for something as large as an ice age without some complicated nonlinear feedback mechanisms, which are not yet fully understood.

Get out of the house. Go to the library, a coffee shop, an office, etc. You need to remove yourself from the temptations and distractions. . . Start screening cell phone calls or remain firm if your friend wants to talk or visit. I had a roommate who had a meltdown right before finals and she tried to call a friend of hers repeatedly. He basically told her he was studying, she had roommates and he couldn't talk. It was mean but it had to be done.. . Don't study 24/7. Apparently it's been shown that if you study too long without a break you become less and less effective as more time passes. Take a break every half an hour or hour.

Its more correct using “me gustaría” if you are asking for something probably will be given to you:. I would like a candy = Me gustaria un dulce.. . Its more correct using “queria” if you are regretting that something was not given to you:. I wanted a candy= Quería un dulce. . . Well, but in colloquial language you can use both with the same meaning, people in the street won’t realize any difference.

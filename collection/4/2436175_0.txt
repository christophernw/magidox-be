Most people don't realize how fragile a surface we live on - to get an idea, put some sawdust and small woodchips into a pot of water, enough to make a thin layer.  Set it on the stove and heat it up.  Long before it begins to boil, convection currents will begin disturbing the sawdust crust much as those in Earth's mantle disturb its crust.

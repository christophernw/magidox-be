...because their density is less than water density (1000 Kg/m^3).. . If the density of an object is less than the density of the water, it floats on the surface of the water. If the density of the object is equal to the density of the water, the object floats anywhere inside the water. If the density of the object is more than the density of the water, the object sinks to the bottom.

Before you do, consider this... after nearly five years of misery, I dug my way out of that awful rut. Meds weren't working, docs weren't helping, and group therapy wasn't helping. I resorted to drinking which just made it worse.... then I tried to end it, and, fortunately, it didn't work. That's when a friend gave me a book. It really taught me a lot about what I could do (and think) to help myself. After reading my webpage on the subject, feel free to email me for clarification, support, or just to talk. http://www.geocities.com/seabulls69/AntidepressantThatWorks.html

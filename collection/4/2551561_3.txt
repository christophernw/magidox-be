The only way it can be done is by listening to them. This is a real hard task 'to listen well'. They sense other human beings much faster than grown ups as their self is still shiny and polished. While talking to you they will start understanding what they want and the purpose they have in life. Each one will be so unique and new in their approach towards life. You youeself also will be finding a purpose in your life by listening to them.

my buddy bought a '67 beetle that did that and we drove it around the farm for a week or so , we both are good with standards , and the "ugly spots " on the clutch wore themselves off and the car stopped doing it , the clutch lasted another 30,000 miles, so check the adjustment and give it a bit more gas as you let out the clutch , good luck

You sound very young. Stop and think before you decide to have sex with any one for the first time, It could cause you a lot of heart ache , both mentally and physically. Ask a parent or another adult  or you can also read  bout it on line if you can't confide in someone.Don't make any one force or talk you into doing something you don't want to do. That's the cool thing to do.....

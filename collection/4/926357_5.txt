You also may have trouble reaching orgasm. But hey, most females wouldn't mind this characteristic in their partner. . . Give it a try for a few weeks and see how it goes. Don't stop taking a drug because of possible side effects. Most side effects go away after a few weeks of use. Besides that there are a lot of drugs to treat anxiety and depression so you can keep trying until you find one you like best. I would know, I think i tried like 5 before i found one that worked. then after 9 years it stopped working and the fun started all over again. Now i'm on effexor and i'm quite pleased with it. I'm the queen of side effects and i haven't experienced any with effexor.

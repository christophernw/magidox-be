50 years ago, it was the norm to take your kids to Sunday school and church every Sunday.  The thing about Sunday school is that it teaches morals and conduct.  Kids today don't get that, we've become so politically correct that taking kids to church is basically a no-no.  It's politically incorrect to point out wrong things to our kids too, like saying its bad to be gay, so the kids grow up having no idea whats right or wrong.  Family outings seem to be becoming a thing of the past too, you rarely see a family with a teenager anymore, and if you do, the teen is on their cell phone and not paying any attention to the family.  Even something as simple as family meals are no more.  Family's have become disconnected and distant, so the kids aren't getting that one on one contact they use to get from their parents.  The parents themselves are distant with each other, too busy with work to bother being married.

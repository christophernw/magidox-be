Thank him. Just turn it down politely.  Blame it on your husband.  Be honest.  . . Maybe suggest something that you and your husband like to do instead?. . Is it a big cook out he's planning with loads of people or just a couple to couple thing?  If it is a big cook out - I'd just go. You don't have to stay long - just make an appearance and go.  . . If it is a couple to couple thing - just politely decline if that is something you don't like to do.

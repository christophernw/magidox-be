not only that they believe everything that Hollywood shows them.. . i have seen people in this forum giving Magickal advise that was direct from the script of Angel. . . I have seen people use The Craft as their only source of knowlege on witchcraft. and use the names of fictional demons and gods from Charmed, The Craft, Angel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Supernatural, and many others. . . they cannot seperate reality from TV. and they do not have the desire to learn nor the patience to study. they just want to believe their TV and know what they think that they know. . . however the bright side is that most people are so blinded by Hollywood that it makes it very easy for the true Witches and Pagans to remain under the radar so to speak.

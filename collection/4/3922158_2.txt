Hello,. .      Yes I do... But I won't tell you because it's not an acceptable solution! Call your dentist and he will do a real tooth filling and diagnose diseases affecting the tooth. The stuff they sell at the pharmacy can be useful if you go hiking in Tchad, but I would see minimal advantages in downtown Phoenix, for example!. . Aren't you a little bit afraid of the dentist? Delaying dental treatment is not a solution! Call him now and take an appointment!

The word "ILLEGAL" is basically my reason why I am against ILLEGAL immigration.. . I do believe in the American Dream as long as they follow the same rules as everyone else.  My parents came here legally and did the paperwork to become a citizen. Why can't these illegals do the same thing? What makes them so special?

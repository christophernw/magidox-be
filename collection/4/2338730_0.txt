if your car has a 60/40 rear folding seat that's your answer depending on the yr there may be a manual latch inside witch is standard equip now. why not the key is the reason obvious does the lock assembly loOK ok at a glance eg.is there rust inside the tumbler, spray some rust inhibitor in on the tumblers and work the key back and forth ..don't break the key!!!! check the fuse panel for a blown fuse location and description can be found on cover or in owners manual finally as in most mechanical issues a detailed account of exactly whats happening will give the person (mech)your soliciting advice from a better chance at diagnosing the issue with minimal guess work for instance when did it start what were the conditions at the time eg. did someone slam into your trunk with a bulldozer lol

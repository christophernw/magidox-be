I am sorry for your loss.  The best advice I can give, is try to buy from a breeder who has both parents on site, so you get an idea of what the temperament of your pup may be.  I remember looking at a litter of Dobies about 20 years ago.  We were not in the market for another dog at that time, but went because the breeders had blue and fawn pups as well as red and black.  The dogs were wonderful!  They were raised with kids and all sorts of animals.  They were kind of laid back compared to many Dobies I had seen, but they were definitely Dobermans, watchful, brave and protective. I have regretted not being able to get one of those all these years.  I hope you can find a really nice pup.

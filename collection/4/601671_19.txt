Let me shine some light on this pale question!. #1 I would bet $$$ you are not even hispanic. #2  Last time I was at a restaurant the cooks,bus boys, etc were Hispanic and last time I checked a restaurant was indoors!!!!. #3 My Hispanic father in law works inside all day with plumbing, his white brother in law works outside all day doing construction. . #4 NOT ALL Illegals are on welfare some of them work VERY VERY HARD and  lets be for real there are so many disgusting lazy Americans we could replace with loyal, law abiding, intelligent illegals! Get Real don't be SO Naive

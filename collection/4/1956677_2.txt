Its not so much motivation for me, its more a way of sciving off my assignment that is due in tomorrow - I should really be doing it rather then sitting  here answering questions like this with people who wont share info  :-)    -     however, I think its a case of 'I feel LESS worse about NOT doing my assignment as I am still sitting at my laptop and NOT playing any online games'. . I also find some of the questions really really funny so it puts me in a better mood!!!!. . "When mamma ain't happy, ain't no one happy"

Why? Good question, to put it in perspective,think of us on the earth in our physical form,then consider another dimension of existence just out of our touch. God tells us a battle is going on in the spiritual world for us. "We do not battle against flesh and blood, but against princes and principalities" that tells us that other influences are at work, they affect our minds,actions,heart if we allow them. That is why there is so much denyal of death, that and fear. hope that helps ~A~. There was a terrible force out there, more terrible than the forces of Mordor. This is because, as St. Paul tells us, our battle is "not against flesh and blood, but against the Principalities and the Powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness on high" (Eph.6:12). Now that sounds pretty ominous. If you are a citizen of this world only, the battle is already lost before it begins. This world is the real Mordor, under the power of one far worse than the Dark Lord, Sauron. Jesus Himself said that the devil was "the Prince of this world" (Jn.16:11). . .     The Prince of this world does not work alone. Besides his demonic companions, he has conscripted most of the powerful men and women of this world, secular and even religious. Control the leaders and you control the masses who follow them. Where can we find a ruler or a statesman who is faithful to the Gospel and who honors Christ as King? Talk about wickedness in high places! With few exceptions they all conduct their government activities not according to what God has ordained in His Commandments, but according to what is politically expedient. They justify their wars and their conquests by lies.

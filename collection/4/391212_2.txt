sorry for the pitiful answers you received so far... wet brain is an "end-stage codition of chronic alchoholism.. the live has necrotized, resulting in failure, the unprocessed ethanol(alcohol)is sent directly to the bloodstream, the brain cells shrink under the assault of ethanol,resulting in space in the brain cavity which fills with fluid. wet brain is irreversible....and fatal....this is why end stage alcohloics act so "crazy"...they are.   don't get WET BRAIN!

Tip your head to the side of the affected ear and holding the ear by the back edge, give it a bit of a tug several times.  If this doesn't work, tip your head the other way and drop a few drops of rubbing alcahol into your ear.  The alcahol will inspire the water to dry up. Never poke anything into your ear because it can cause many horrible problems worse than damp ears.

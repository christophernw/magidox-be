Hiya Zukenukes. Move the paper you muppet lol lol, give the pup summat to chew, raw hide, pigs ears, chew stick, the list is endless, your pup is teething and his gums need to split to let more teeth come through, the only relief he can get is by chewing, he is gonna do this until he is about 10-11 months old, so get buying them chewies for him........ :-)

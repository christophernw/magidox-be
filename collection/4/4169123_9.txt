All the crap you've ever heard about beatings or feeding the dog gunpowder to make him mean are bogus, abusive crap.  To make a dog more confident, expose him to lots of new people and situations.  Then he'll be able to tell a threat from a situation that is not serious.  Some breeds are naturally tougher, while others will never be aggressive no matter what you do.. . If you teach your dog to bite, you will have a liability problem - you and your family can be sued or even go to jail if your dog injures someone.  Your homeowner's insurance policy may refuse to cover you if you have a dangerous dog.  Most dogs never get to bite someone breaking into your house or attacking you - they bite your friends or visitors.  How would you feel if your dog mauled someone's child?  . . If you really need protection that bad, get a gun.  at least it doesn't have a mind of its own.

I don't think that it is about my religion being accepted.There are several different religions.However God being accepted is a different story.I am baptist.It doesn't matter to me what denomination you are as long as God gets all the praise and glory He deserves.A-lot of people criticize believers of trying to cram things down their throats.It's like this:if you found something good or something helpful to you at the store you would want to share it with others.This is the same when you find God.You have found something Great and Awesome in power and you want to share it with others.I pray for those who don't know God.

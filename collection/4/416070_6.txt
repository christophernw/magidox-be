Check it for lacerations firstly. It is not uncommon for dogs to cut themselves between the toes, on the webbing, and that is often missed because you have to spread the toes to see it. If she has a cut, she may or may not have to go to the vet to get it stitched up, and the sooner the better so it is exposed to fewer infection causing agents. . If it is not cut, that means that it's either a fracture, sprain or something with the ligaments/tendons. You can go to the vet to be on the safe side, but it would be OK to wait until morning to see if it gets better or worse. . If she is not limping in the morning, she probably just pulled it and does not need to see a vet. . If she is limping in the morning, especially if it is worse, the vet will be able to tell you the cause of her pain, and either cast it or just give you doggie pain killers for her. Good luck.

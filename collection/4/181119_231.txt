well furnindo, i really enjoy my summer job and maybe you can as well.  It's working as a cashier on the front end of Perlmutter ShopRite (and always save.) I make $9.00 an hour and just started 2 weeks ago !! Not only is it stress free and relaxing, but you make new friends and learn to adapt to a drama free environment. If you ask me, you should seriously consider this for your summer job, thankyou and GAbye.

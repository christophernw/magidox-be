I am 5' 8" and 50 yo and proud of it. Nothing you do will make you taller unless you go to the extreme of having your legs broken and stretched, months of pain etc.. . If you are that insecure wear high heels - but remember Winston Churchill was your height, and I suspect Tom Cruise and Mel Gibson are no taller.

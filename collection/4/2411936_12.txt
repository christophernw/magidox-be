This is a tough question but true christians do love everyone, God loves everyone, but he hates their sin. We are to love the sinner but hate the sin. Also we are called as true believers to expose false teachings of other religions, this is not being judgmental, but we must be careful and do everything in Love. If a person will sincerely seek God he will give you the answers, but we need to open our hearts to him. He is Real and He cares. God Bless

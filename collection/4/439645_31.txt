rg brooks19 has a great answer. This war was started by Bush because he lost face big time after 9/11. He failed to find bin Laden, he failed to avenge all those who died, and he failed to live up to his promises he made standing at ground zero. Bush made the mistake of thinking this would be a quick and painless war, one that would look good on the evening news, and increase his popularity rating. I personally believe Bush should be impeached for starting this war. He lied to Congress, and he lied to us.

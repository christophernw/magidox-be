I saw only one correct answer. You can guarantee yourself a posting at Ft. Leavenworth Ks., but other than that, you will go where the Army needs you to go. You can have anything in your contract, but the fine print says it's all about the needs of the Army. If they feel like they need you in Antarctica, then pack your cold weather gear, soldier. It's time to play with the penguins. Beat the crap out of an officer though, and you can go to Ks.. But I assure you, you'd prefer to play with the penguins. But if you really want to go overseas, be a tanker. You'll get there eventually. Can you use chopsticks?

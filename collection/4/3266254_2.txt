Strangely enough, ma'am, the hamburger didn't come from Hamburg and neither has it got ham in it; and the frankfurter wasn't from Frankfurt, either!?. . It's actually a fact that the Americans who first made them wanted to just give them a kind of exotic "foreign" name and did this.. . Hamburg and Frankfurt got it's hamburgers and frankfurters from US Fast Food Joints that opened there.. . Have a nice day.

It's usually people that dont clean in everyday life that are the ones who make a mess. They have no respect. The ones who leave dirty dishes and dont rinse them, or they leave clothes on the floor. I guarantee the first time they have to clean up their own pee or crap they are gonna think differently about making a mess.

I'm not sure exactly why there is a variation in the color of semen, but not everyone's is the milky white we are generally led to believe it is by our peers.  Yellowish, whitish, perhaps clear.  Watery, syrupy, even jellylike are all normal.  Not only does it very from person to person, it even varies for one person.

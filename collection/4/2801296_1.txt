There is actually a medical condition (name escapes me  at the moment)  in which the unfortunate person exudes an unpleasant odor although I seem to remember that  these people are usually aware of it, and seek  medical help.     I  don't  believe for a moment  that anybody would deliberately do anything to make him- or herself smell awful,  but  whatever the cause is, I think the best  way to handle it would be for  you and one or two others to  see  the  teacher quietly and explain the problem, and leave the teacher to probably communicate with the parents..                                                       But  if you do go to the teacher with this problem, whatever you do, don't be a'gigglin and a'laughin,  or the teacher will get the idea that  you are   just pulling a  stunt, and not  take you  seriously.    If that  teacher is going to  stick her neck out and  talk to that girl's parents, she is going to have to  feel confident that the complaint is  legit.

It's not just photons that have both wave-like and particle-like behaviour, it's all things.  And, photons, of all wavelengths, are "particles" in the sense of being fundamental particles as the term is used in physics.  Things like electrons moving at a modest speed have very high frequencies compared to photon of visible light, since the frequency is given by the energy times two pi over Planck's constant.  This is why electron microscopes can have resolutions higher than optical microscopes: the frequency is higher, thus the wavelength is shorter, and resolution is a function of wavelength.  Higher frequency light will also give better resolution, which is why many optical technologies used in things like semiconductor manufacturing these days use ultraviolet light.  Basically, despite everything having a wave-like nature, higher energy particles in a traveling pulse will be concentrated into a smaller wave packet.  So, in that sense, higher energy light is more "particle-like" than lower energy light, since it will have less spatial uncertainty and behave more like things that are conventionally thought of as particles, like electrons.  And, likewise, low energy light will be more wave-like.  For example, if you're desiging a radio antenna, you're going to be thinking of it in terms of classical electromagnetic wave theory, even though radio waves, like all EM waves, are quantized into photons.

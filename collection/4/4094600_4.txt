I guess it should be the brain because any change in blood pH or oxygen or CO2 conc is immediately sensed by receptors in the brain and mechanisms to cause changes are activated.. and endocrine and liver are affected by only long term change in homeostasis if they are affected... Brain recieves the highest perfusion so i'm guessing its the brain which wil be affected most...

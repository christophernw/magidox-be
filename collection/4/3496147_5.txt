ha ha! too bad it didn't really happen, but i'll answer your question anyways.. . jesus was mad because they made a place of worship into a bank and auction yard. he wouldn't get mad at a bank for changing money. but he said that he father's house had been made into a den of theives. he wasn't mad because someone was using the bank!. . also, i don't think he would be swearing. and he had righteous anger, not some crazy anger derived from drinking too much.. . does that help at all?

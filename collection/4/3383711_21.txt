God is totally loving. To be totally loving, you have to be totally fair/just. If you are totally fair, and you make a promise, you have to stick to it. Because God said that "He who has the Son has life. He who does not have the Son does not have life" (1 John), He must hold to His promise. If He were not fair/just, and allowed a one who did not have His Son into heaven, then how could he be totally just and thus totally loving...I hope you consider this answer. Thanks for the opportunity to provide an answer!

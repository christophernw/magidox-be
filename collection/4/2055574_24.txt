just because they come from Christian families doesnt mean that they were Christians themselves.. . and many of the people that rape those women are not Christians. and for the record, America is no longer a Christian nation.. . you fail to realize that the people who commit those atrocities are NOT Christians. the Bible says that hatred is the equivalent of murder, and a murderer is an abomination to the earth. REAL Christians do not hate, kill or rape.

This is what works for me:. 1. Pick a gym as close to home as possible - it takes me three minutes to get to the gym and I spend half an hour there - that way I can go often, because in the time it takes to make up an excuse - I can go to the gym and be back and get on with life.. 2.  In the first couple of months, place a premium on going to the gym over what you actually do at the gym - the important thing initially is simply to show up often - if you are crunched for time or feeling lazy - plan to show up for ten minutes - even if you can only show up for ten minutes it is better than not showing up at all and usually you'll actually stay longer.

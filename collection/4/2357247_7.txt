Just accept that you're gonna make a few mistakes and you may stutter a bit at the beginning. If it happens you're prepared for it and you can relax and get on with it. No one is perfect and everyone needs practise. Instead of fighting it if it happens, make a little joke of it and carry on. otherwise if first few minutes go badly and can affect the rest of the presentation which makes you even more nervous and self-conscience. if you accept that you'll be nervous you soon forget about it and build up confidence for the next time

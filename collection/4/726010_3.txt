I call it the ladies room. Or the rest room since you rest on the toilet.I call it a bathroom when I am home because it is the room with the bath in it and happens to have the toilet in it. However when I am out in public I call it a restroom because it's much more polite sounding toilet. Toilet sounds, I don't know, gas station like. You could use that term with your best,trusted, honest friends. Sometimes people would say restroom because they might have to pop out a booger or wash their hands or see if their underwear are showing.

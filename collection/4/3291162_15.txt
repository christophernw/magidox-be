Add cream cheese, chives or do a parmesan smashed potaoes.  Red -skinned potatoes with parmesan, garlic, salt &pepper.. I made a cauliflower/potato mash once...my kids have asked me to make again a lot.  I don't know what I did with the recipe.  It was really good and definitely different.  Maybe search it online?

I suggest you go with a vodka cooler to try.  It is a lot cheaper and there are many varieties to choose from.  My favourite is the Smirnoff ice - red label.  It has a "lemonade" kind of taste but someone told me that if you drink too many, it really knocks you for a loop so be careful not to drink it too fast and remember that there is alcohol in it.

Don't mess around with eye irritation. It could be as simple as allergies but could be something more serious. If your eye gets an infection in it and its not treated you could lose your eye. Its not something to play with get it checked out as soon as possible. Even if you don't have insurance to see doctor go to the emergency room if it continues.

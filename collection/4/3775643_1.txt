I am DEFINATELY agreeing with everyone else on this.  Cramps are caused by a potassium deficiency.  It also can just be caused because of you doing a LOT of activity (ie- exercise)and all of a sudden stopping. The "not stretching" causes the muscles going into somewhat a stress and ta-da... you have cramps.  Eat some bananas or take a multi-vitamin supplement and that usually seems to clear up things... But be careful not to over due the potassium because you can go into a potassium shock i guess you would say THEN be in worse shape than to begin with... lol Always check with your family doc... the best idea

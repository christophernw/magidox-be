Now what I am about to say may not apply to individual cases, but is statistically true.  So, that said, no bashing me or gnashing of teeth and screaming that you have a cousin, who knows this guy who has a friend ..... . Generally someone who has earned a degree has shown an aptitude to learn new things, to be flexible and to plan and stay with a course of action.  This translates into a tendency for the college grad to be more easily trained not only to do their own work, but to sort of be a team leader.  They also come out of school with current theories and a lack of "bad habits". . Also, if the company has a "resume" that they use to sell themselves to the outside world, having "23 people with Bachelors, 8 Masters Degrees and 1 PhD" looks better than "22 people with Bachelors, 8 Masters Degrees and 1 PhD and this other guy.". . Not fair.  Maybe not.  I got into Comp Sci without a degree, but I took the time and money to invest in a Masters Degree in it and it has eventually paid off.  So, maybe that is the answer for you.. . Sorry and good luck.

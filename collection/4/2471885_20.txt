comprehension.... intellectual ability: the ability to grasp the meaning of something. . apprehension.... ability to understand: the power or ability to grasp the importance, significance, or meaning of something. . intellectual.... relating to thought process: relating to or involving the mental processes of abstract thinking and reasoning rather than the emotions. . I included in the definitions above the word "intellectual" since that is part of the definition for "comprehension". Note the part where it says "...mental processes of abstract thinking and reasoning rather than the emotions". I think Encarta has good definitions of the words comprehension and apprehension.. . By looking at the definitions above (from MSN Encarta Online Dictionary) they seem like synonyms.. . Well, I guess they are similar in that they can both be a type of understanding. If they are similar, then which one do you use? It all depends on the context you are using it in. (By the ways, I didn't see anywhere that comprehension and apprehension were synonyms). . . Do you say...She was walking down the dark ally when she suddenly apprehended danger. Or, do you say...She was walking down the dark ally when she suddenly comprehended danger. So does she 'intellectually understand' that she is about to get robbed or killed? Or does she get the feeling (maybe she heard footsteps and butterfly knife sounds behind her) that something bad is about to happen to her, in other words, "Yikes!! There is someone behind me who might hurt or rob me! I feel strongly that I should run away!!"? ...I believe you would say 'apprehend'.. . Even though they are similar when you're speaking of 'understanding', I think the difference is between *intellectual* understanding vs. emotional understanding. . . So, I agree with some of what Maverick said, except I do think that it's good you asked that question. English speaking peoples should know(comprehend) there own language! :) . . Thanks for asking that question!

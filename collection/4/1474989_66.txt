God did not take your friend....the drugs did; and that is nothing more than an influence from the devil. God does not use hurtful things to "teach us a lesson", that's not how He works.. . This is what God wants for us...."For I know the plans I have for you," says the LORD. "They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope."   Jeremiah 29:11 (New Living Translation). . I am truly sorry for your loss. Please do not loose faith in the Almighty, because of this! That's exactly what the devil wants to happen! Stay close to God and pray that He lifts the sorrow from your heart....as I will be doing, for you.

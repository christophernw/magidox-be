I would start at the local police station and ask for a copy of any reports related to the accident.  You could also try the library or local newspaper office for "micro-filmed" or "micro-fished" copies of the newspaper at the time of the accident.  Then I would contact the county courthouse to see if anything was filed in court.  It'll cost you a little bit of money for copies of everything, but you'll get your information.

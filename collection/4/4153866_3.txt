hmmm well im not really sure but if you take drugs at the concert then this would surely be the reason, as all you happy endorphins would be used up. if not the only thing i can think of is if you are really tired the next day you can just feel emotional because your system is depleted and you will find it harder to deal with things...maybe you could also become upset because something you were looking forward to is over?

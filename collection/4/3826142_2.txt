There are not hundreds of verifiable fulfilled prophecies in the bible, so there is no need to explain them.. . In most cases where it appears to be so, the language is vague, it is impossible to validate that the event came before the prophecy, and&#92;or the witnesses are impossible to verify.. . If, despite lack of strong historical or scientific evidence you still believe they all came true, then you can explain them with magic, or divine power, or some other supernatural force.

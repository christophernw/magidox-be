The connection is so simple it can be summarized in one word: RELIGION.. This is what I like to call the Jesus, (Christians/Jews) Vs. Mo-hammed, (Muslims), war. It has been going on at least since the Crusades of the middle ages.. Some may argue that this alliance is not possible since the Jewish religion doesn't even accept Jesus as a Messiah, Savior, Avatar, etc. However, it wouldn't take a History major to conclude Israel would support Jesus instead of Mo-hammed.

Because the Food and Drug Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms cannot agree on who will get the taxes?. . This has been debated to death.  Pot is less harmful than alcohol.  Some say it is a "gateway" drug that leads to further experimentation with drugs.  If it was legal and you got it from someone other than a street dealer it wouldn't put you into contact with people who were selling other illegal substances, now, would it?. . When was the last time you heard of someone high on pot wiping out a family of five on the freeway?  Not them...that's the job of all those who are addicted to that "legal" drug, alcohol.. . People who have been smoking pot are more likely to be munching out and having deep philosophical discussions such as ......"Dude!"......"Yeah!"/////etc.  They aren't out driving because they can't get motivated and stay on task long enough to find their keys and wallet.

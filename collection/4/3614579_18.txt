some cats prefer to be indoors, I know lots of people who have house cats, it's perfectly normal. They are not meant tobe outside 24/7 that's just cruel. If she's meowing to come in let her in!! If you don't want the responsibilities of having a pet re home her so she can be treated properly and get the love and attention she deserves!!!

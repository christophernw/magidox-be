I don't know how to define pornography but I can tell it when I see it.  ~Some Guy.. . Pornographic materiel is anything that evokes a carnal urge in a human.  One person can look at Michalangelo's David or Bottecelli's The Birth of Venus as magnificent master strokes of art, while others will see them as vile pornography.

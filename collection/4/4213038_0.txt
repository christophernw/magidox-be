In the 16th century, the French were impressed by the silk scarves that the Croatian Army members were wearing around their necks in order to be protected from cold. They adopted it into their noble clothing first. Then the common started to use it as a fashion symbol. The necktie is called Crovatte in French ( excuse the spelling..) which means Croatian.

Make sure that you are not rewarding the very behavior you want to discourage, not even by paying attention to it. Don't even LOOK at her when she is begging. Instead, teach her that the rewards happen when she is NOT begging. My cats know to go wait by their own food dishes during people meals ... because good cats get treats when people finish eating.

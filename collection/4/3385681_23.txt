i don't think it's bad. it's just cos of the caffeine level, but if you drink that much coffee, it wouldn't be bad either. it's probably like those video games with the warnings: we think 'who would this bother if you played for more than 6 hours!' but it'll get about 1 person in 10 000. so they're just avoiding a lawsuit!

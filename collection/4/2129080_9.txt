we'll know as soon as it happens. the gravitational force is instantaneous. as soon as the sun disappears we might see it still there but the orbit of earth will not be . defined as earth moves in a defined orbit only due to the gravitational pull of. the sun.. at that moment maybe the earth will start moving towards another star and make another orbit or maybe . it will collide with jupiter or something. that is very uncertain.... . but as soon as the sun disappears we'll start feeling a force due to disorder in the earths motion

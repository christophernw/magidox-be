its not a disease.  You're vitimin deficient.  You need calcium. Get yourself 500mg calcium tabs take one daily and you'll also want to get yourself a 1000 mg multivitmin taken one a day (which include vitamin B),  Improve your diet with more vegetables as well.  Due to lack of calcium and vitimins your nails are getting brittle and to put it very bluntly falling apart.  See your doctor for a routine checkup to also see what else you may be deficient in.

Ugh.  How can such a simple question be so complicated?. . Rainbows are formed because different colors of light refract (bend) different amounts.  When you see a rainbow, light hits a whole bunch of water droplets almost parallel, then the high wavelength light (purple) is refracted the most while the low wavelength light (red) refracts the least.  Oh, but if only it were that simple!  Then this light bounces off the back of the droplet and the result is that the violet light exits the droplet at a more shallow angle than the red light.. . Where was I?  Okay, so if violet light is coming at you from a more shallow angle, you'll see it more centralized in your field of vision.  Red light, on the other hand, is taking a much steeper path down towards you, so you observe it higher and farther out.  These angles have been carefully measured and there's a great website all about rainbows with better demonstrations and explanations that I can attempt.  It even says rainbows aren't all arcs (sort of)!

Because of greed, my friend. Many have become jaded and do not share the gifts that God has provided them with. If you've ever seen the movie "Schindler's List" that is a wonderful example of a true loving human being. I wish that there were more people like that here. He gave his entire fortune to help the Jews during WWII. God bless him! Unfortunately, that kind of generosity today is rare. I'm not saying that we should give it all away, but if I were rich, I would do as much as I could to help. Too bad we cannot just pool all the wealth of the world and distribute it evenly but there are those who would abuse it. However, many wealthy people do give quite a lot for their fellow man. Perhaps one day we can live in peace like John Lennon (God rest his soul), speaks of in the song "Imagine." We can dream, we can hope, we can pray.

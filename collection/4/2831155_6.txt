Death is nature's way of telling you that it's time to give back what you borrowed at birth. . . Although there seems to be some anecdotal evidence for reincarnation, there's actually no way of knowing what, if anything, happens after death. It would seem that, based on the laws of thermodynamics, nothing ever truly goes away, so perhaps that is also true of what we refer to as "soul" or "personality." . . Since I'll most likely be leaving before you do, if there's any way to send word back, I'll let you know. :D

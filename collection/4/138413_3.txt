in linguistics, (which is my major) the sound of the letter "W" is same as the sound of "V" or its variant "B". So in old english (and german as well) the pronounce "William" as "Villiam"... over the course of history the shortened form of   "William" or "Villiam" is "Will" or "Vill" which led to "Bill" and is one we are using today.

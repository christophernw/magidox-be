check your pcv valve and crankcase breathers to rule out any pressure concerns, if all this is working properly I would go back to the fuel pump as it sounds like it might just be a bad part when purchased new,also check all of your vapor return system from your pump to fuel tank or canister. you didn't mention if it had any other oil leaks but if it was caused by excessive crankcase psi it would show oil seepage from various areas

Not only that, but would you want to see people wearing the means of your childs death, say if your child was stabbed with a dagger, wouldn't you consider it a slap to see everybody wearing symbols of that dagger around their necks, or displaying them on their buildings, etc.? The means of Jesus death was a criminals death, and Jesus died for us, but he was not necessarily proud to be put to death in that manner. He even prayed to God, his Father to take that cup of suffering away from him, so why people want to wear them is questionable. And yes, many people do bow down before  crucifixes.

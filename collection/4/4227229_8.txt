I can see why you think that they are selfish. I can also understand why someone would want to kill themselves. They probably did not fully want to though, or they would have probably died. I have known a couple of seriously suicidal people. Actually, my two best friends which seems a bit odd. I guess maybe I'm attracted to people like that since I have been myself. Sometimes, it really seems like life is pointless and having to sit through all the pain of life for the 60 or maybe more years is just useless. If someone thinks no one loves them, they won't feel like it'd be selfish since they believe that their death wouldn't affect anyone.

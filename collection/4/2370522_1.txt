Its like the whole thing.. . "A priori" knowledge is stuff you know before you look at anything.  Hume denied the validity of a priori knowledge, to be more precise a priori knowledge with any content. (Logic is known a priori but it doesn't actually tell you anything).. . Kant said that there ARE some elements of knowledge that are known a priori by means of examining reason itself.  Anything presented to reason must exist in "time" and "space", so we know that "time" and "space" exist though we have no direct perception of either.. . What "transcendental" means I've never quite worked out.

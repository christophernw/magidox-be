The trend now a days is to use two stroke diesel engines. . The ships propeller should turn slowly so that losses due to water splashing (eddy currents) are minimum. In two stroke engines, the engine fires every second stroke, whereas in four stroke it fires once in four strokes. So 2 stroke engines can be designed to run very slowly (100 RPM or so) and yet be powerful enough, to move a big ship. They are directly coupled to the propeller.  If 4 stroke engine is used, a reduction gear will have to be used to slow down the propeller, and this means more weight on the ship.Slow speed also allows the use of cheaper fuel, which requires more time to burn. Also, vibrations and wear/tear is less in 2 stroke engines.

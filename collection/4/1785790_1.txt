it is different for everyone.for girls some might not get their period until they are in there early 20s!everyone is different.others and yourself shouldnt judge yourself because you havent been through puberty.when it comes u could probably have 2 shave everyday just to keep the facial hair under control. its all in good time. your time will come when your body thinks it is ready.

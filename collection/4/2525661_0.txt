If you mean how do you take each other close to climax, but keep from the actual "event"... then here's some info:   Work slowly and bring them close, BUT back off and concentrate on massaging or rubbing another area of their body [stomach, chest, etc.]... once they "settle down", return to stimulating them again.  Do this repeatedly and you will find your orgasms to be even more intense.

Iknowwhereyouliveman is right.  but it probably would've sucked anyways, because that is the only organization that could be blamed for what happened on New Orleans, and even if its funding would not have been slashed somebody would still have to have the finger pointed at them in the end, and FEMA would have been in its path anyways.

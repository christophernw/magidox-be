If you go to bed drunk, you won't. I've heard it said that everything we experience in a day, and translated into dreams at night, and that what we see in the day, in our wake moments, is just a fraction of what's REALLY going on in our own little world. Dreaming can take many phases, and the last one, is Rapid Eye Movement dreams. THESE are the ones you remember when you wake up.

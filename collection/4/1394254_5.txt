People having a parade to try to convince the rest of us that same sex, sexual relationships is normal. Men who indulge in anal sex with other men, otherwise known as buggery; want to tell us that is normal. Now it's fashionable for women to indulge perverted if not such dangerous practices. Television and movies of course promote this as normal, because most people "working" in the media - are perverted. I would like to see them do real work - where they have to sweat and mix with real men! They wouldn't call them "darling" - they would have a broken nose to take home with them.

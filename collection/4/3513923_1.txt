Basic probability is just favorable outcomes divided by possible.  If you're rolling 1 die (dice is plural) and betting on the one, your probability of winning is 1/6.. . Compound probability is about 2 (or more) events BOTH happening.  If you roll 2 dice and bet both are one's, probability is (1/6)*(1/6)=1/36.  The probability of a one on each die is the same, 1/6.  The result would be the same if you rolled 1 die twice, since on both rolls, the die has 6 sides and you're only betting on one of them.. . Conditional probability is also about 2 events, but the probability of the second event is influenced by the result of the first.  Example: you have a drawer of socks, 6 brown and 8 white.  What's the probability you reach in and pull out 2 white?. . Think of it as 2 events.  On pulling out the 1st sock, you have 14 to choose from, 8 of them white, so the probability of success is 8/14.  When you go to pull out the second sock, success the first time has changed the numbers.  Now you only have 13 to choose from, 7 of them white.  Probability of success here is 7/13.. . So the probability you get 2 white is (8/14)*(7/13)=4/13.. . If you read more about it, look for phrases like "with replacement" and "without replacement."

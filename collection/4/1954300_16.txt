No, it is from many factors, one of the predominant factors is the after effect of WWII. The US was the only real power left in the world, and everyone came to us. Prior to that it was not unusual for people to have a basic working vocabulary of multiple languages, and at one time, as late as the mid-60s, one was not considered truly educated unless they could speak Latin, and/or another functioning language.. . Of course, maybe that is the problem, we DO NOT value education and knowledge anymore, we want to warp ourselves in religious superstition.

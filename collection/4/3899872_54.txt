Well the Italian word Spaghetti is actually the plural form of the word Spaghetto (a single noodle) There are two different ways to assess the situation. First, take a spaghetto and chew on it. If there is a hard center and a soft outside it is done if you are cooking it Al Dante. If you want it cooked thoroughly, boil it until it is soft all of the way through. You can also throw a Spaghetto at any vertical surface. If it sticks, it is done. If it rolls, it is not done. This is not a very good technique because even if the noodle is overedone, it will stick.. . Hope that helps.

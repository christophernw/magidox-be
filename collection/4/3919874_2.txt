Well... You just go out there and start doing it... You find a good job while you're still with your parents... Then save money for your car... then go and save alot more for futre use... Never know what you will need it for... But if you do that... then it shouldn't be that hard to start out... But living an Adult life isn't that hard... just have to keep up with bills and food... thats really it...

Wherever this person got the idea for this question is actually more interesting than answering it.. . Throughout history, people in power look for "enemies" that they can focus their public base's attention on. Jews have served this convenience for many years and today, especially amongst Arabs and Muslims in the middle east (even moderates), the Jews are used as a focus of anger by governments and other political groups.. . "Don't have clean water? - It's the JEWS fault!". "Unhappy about your totalitarian Arab government - blame the JEWS!". "Dislike anyting in your life that you can't fully understand - the JEWS are behind it!". . - the Jews blew up the twin towers.. - the Jews make all Arabs miserable.. - and now... the Jews killed Kennedy!. . How about these:. - the Jews are why gas is $3 in the U.S.!. - the Jews are letting illegal immigrants into the US!. - the Jews are why I was in a traffic jam this morning!. - the Jews are behind why I ran out of toilet paper last night!. . WAKE UP! Realize that you are being manipulated. Look for the facts, not the hype and the anger.. . If this is the best answer, please vote it the best answer. Thanks!

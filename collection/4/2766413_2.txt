It has nothing to do with the police, please see below.. . The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB), an Executive Agency of the Home Office, provides wider access to criminal record information through its Disclosure service.  This service enables organisations in the public, private and voluntary sectors to make safer recruitment decisions by identifying candidates who may be unsuitable for certain work, especially that involve children or vulnerable adults.  The CRB was established under Part V of the Police Act 1997 and was launched in March 2002..  . Prior to 2002, access to police checks was mainly confined to organisations in the statutory sector for staff who had ‘substantial unsupervised access’ to children.  There were many other organisations that could not access these checks and yet had staff with similar access to vulnerable groups.  The CRB enables many more organisations to access these checks as part of good recruitment practice..  . Organisations wishing to use the service can ask successful job applicants to apply for one of two types of check.  The type of check required will depend upon the nature of the position.  These are called Enhanced and Standard Disclosures, both require a fee but are free of charge to volunteers.

Bathes are nessessary because without taking baths, they cn easily get sick and get dirty.  As you might notice anyway, they even take bathes on there own... One cool fact is that birds that live in the wild often even let ants go up their bodies.  This is because that want the ants to "eat" away dirt.  Often ducks use the beak and get oil from their tail and spread them thu-out the body to keep it moisterize...

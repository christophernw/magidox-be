Ill tell you iv heard some really crazy things and i mean some  things i heard are just plain retarded like smearing peanut butter on game and wiping it off,even herd some say put it in the toilet bowl and flush it.But i would take it to a game store and have them buff it or you can just buy your own buffing Kit they are pretty handy to have around.I will tell you one trick that i always do and it seems to work most of the time,don't freak out now i know this sounds weird(lol)but it works..take the C.D. and wipe it on your forehead so that the oil gets on the C.D. use a soft cloth like a cotton shirt to smear it around,then blow on it to fog it up ya know i mean,and wipe it off.Like i said i know it sounds weird but i do it all the time.

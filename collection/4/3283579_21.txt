The Catholic Church is upset for the same reason Jews were upset by the Protocols of Zion fiction: the Da Vinci code contains untruths and makes one of its prelatures (the Opus Dei prelature) seem monstrous and inhuman.. . Catholics are no more wrong at finding fault in an anti-Catholic work than Jews would be to find objection in the characterization of Shylock.. . As to the alleged "worth" of the Gnostic gospels, they are second century works, the youngest of them half a century younger than the canonical gospels. They were omitted because they were written much later, at a time when all living eyewitnesses were gone. The "Gospel" of Phillip, the only (incomplete) work that provides even the beginning of a hint that the Da Vinci Code's theories are validatable, is not known to be older than the 5th century, four hundred years younger than the gospels (the Nag Hammadi is a 5th century excavation, younger than the Council of Nicaea even.). . Catholics are right to oppose anti-Catholicism, just as Jews  are right to oppose anti-semitism.

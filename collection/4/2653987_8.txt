They have throughout the centuries of making observations compiled data on what conditions led to what types of weather.  If one tried to computationally predict the weather, they could not.  I have read [I believe it was in an article in Scientific American] that even the Cray III supercomputer could not effectively calculate all the variables in order to give a 100% accurate weather forecast in a reasonable amount of time to use said forecast.  So, what the people on TV and elsehwere do is [by probable statistics] determine a likely weather forecast based on historical data.

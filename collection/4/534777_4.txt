The answer to your second question is probably still in the archives.  We all know the country sold war bonds to finance the war.  It wasn't the same economy as today.. . To begin with, compared to today, the average American lived in poverty.  We didn't know that then, because nobody was wealthy back then.  A bicycle was a luxury item.  If you had a car, you could only drive it on rare occasions, because repair parts were barely available, gasoline and rubber were rationed, actually you couldn't even buy tires.  You needed ration tickets to buy milk, eggs, meat.  Actually, ration tickets for milk, were for small children and babies.  Meat could not be purchased on Tuesdays.. . Most manufacturing plants were made into defense plants, for the purchase of war materials, so many items of the day, including automobiles, were not being made between early 42 thru late 45.. . The bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima occured when the bombs were tested and delivered.  The Japanese had refused unconditional surrender, and the decision to bomb rather than invade was based on the projected troop lose we would suffer in an invasion.

Well, this is not really a way to cope...but a bit of cheering up :) Eventually the classes you take are going to get harder, and it's not going to be possible to cram for them...that's when you'll shine. You already have the foundation, and you can bet that you will remember the info far longer than your friends who cram the night before. So keep your chin up, as hard and unfair as it seems right now, cuz eventually your hard work will pay off! Just my two cents.

Primarily because Jews make a special attempt as a culture to remember that they are not part of the prevaling culture and that they are to remain a Holy Nation, a People Set Apart.  There's this annoying tendacy of people to fear what they don't understand, and hate what they fear.. . Most humans wish desperately to be part of the larger whole, whether they wish to admit it or not.  So to have this small group that maintains its culture in all defiance of the concept of integration, and that has done so for millenia, leaves a lot not understood, and thus a lot feared, and thus a lot hated.

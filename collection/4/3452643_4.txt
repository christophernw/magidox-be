I agree with the first answer.  I am a Democrat, but of a different sort than has started representing our party.  I am a U.S.A. citizen first and stand with my Republican and Democrat citizens in not calling our leaders names and spreading unfounded rumors.  There were many people doing so in the name of Republicans back when President Clinton was in office, and it was totally inappropriate.. Oh, dissention and disagreement, debate and protest!  YES!  That's as American as apple pie, but the nasty rumor spreading?  The guilty until proven innocent attitude?  The name calling?  The undermining of our country for the sake of political points?. . I know many of our Republican participants will side with me when it comes time to fight these things and there is a Democrat in office as President.  Let's start now and set the tone, shall we?. . Oh, I am not ungodly, but KNOW God exists.  I am no coward, and will happily answer you, support our troops including the chief of our troops President Bush, I don't lie, I am happily married and don't particular approve of the gay lifestyle.. . I am, however a firm supporter of free speech (including for Republican talk shows and religions), free expression (see previous item), and equal rights (not special rights, but firm penalties for any sort of bigotry that is not private, including anti-white bigotry).. . We will return to the top with those values, not the nonsense you see now.  Give us time.  Maybe cheer us on?  You'd be surprised what two parties that disagree on the specifics but support each other on the big picture can do together...

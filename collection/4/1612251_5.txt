Dont listen to these non believers, I say God is a "he" because It says in the bible in capital letters, "He" or "His".  Besides if your a non believer then enjoy your life while you can, Life is a test, and these non believers are just putting there pencil down and no even hitting a lick at it.  Personally I'd rather be safe than sorry as well.

The Queen doesn't actually have 2 birthdays.. her actual birth day is in April (I think it's the 28th of April.. something like that) but, they put on a big celebration in June instead because the weather is traditionally MUCH better in England in June than it is in April, which is usually cool, wet, and rainy.. . Wouldn't you prefer to celebrate your birthday in NICE weather?

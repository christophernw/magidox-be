Actually Frank missed it on this one. I know of an independent film company that has two films ready to start shooting. One for $750,00 the other for $500,000. . . The movie "Saw" was made for a million. For every Saw movie, you have a million straight to Hollywood or Blockbustors video movies. . . The calculation is the investors take half, and the distribitor takes the other half.. . The real problem is when they buy the film; you get up to a certain point; and after that they take the rest. You have to have a real solid movie that the right people see to break that mold. Good Luck!

It looks like you are having a hard time with spelling, don't worry I'm a really bad speller myself. It all depends on what you are needing advice for, if it is about how to go about studying, then why don't you think of creative things to do, like write a book (To work on your spelling), or make note cards? I'm writing a movie now to help me on my spelling and things. So I hope I helped and good luck hang in there ;0)

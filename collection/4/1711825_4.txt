i don't like any of it.. it is stupid and childish.. the slavery days have long been gone and i wasn't around back in those days anyway. so why have i been called racist slurs?. it wasn't my fault. and if u think about it.....my ancestors came over here in a "big boat" too. i can't do anything about that. can i?. can't we all just move on and live in peace with one another?.      ~ let the past be the past!

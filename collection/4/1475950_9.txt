In theory, the public sector is anwerable though your elected representatives, but in practice some of these Government Quangoes are a law unto themselves, do whatever they please are not anwerable to anyone but the Courts of Law and do not even comply then. . . Private companies are answerable to nobody but themselves or their shareholders and their bankers. . . If your rented accomodation is put into the private sector, you will not get any protection from the frequent landlords malpractice (unethical but within the law). They will simply harass and bully their tenants as they please with no comebacks.

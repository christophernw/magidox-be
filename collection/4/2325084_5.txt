Talk to your boss and explain this to him/her.. I am a Manager and enjoy my job as i am always being put through courses to excel myself which has prevented me being bored so i am constantly learning and bettering myself. If you were to tell your boss you are not feeling as effective as you would like be, chances are they will change your role at work for the better prehaps stepping up the ladder as they would then understand your not just one of the donkeys and are a keen and motivated person, "happy people make happy work places"

your company would have to change your status to salary.. Most jobs are either one or the other in their job description.. You can petition to your HR department, or ask them the question.. . If you want to know what your hourly wage would be as salary, the closest you could come would be to take yoru hourly wage times 40, which would be weekly, then take that times 52 for the weeks of the year (and remove any holidays you are not paid for)

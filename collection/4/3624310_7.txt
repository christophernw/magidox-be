We are to pray without  ceasing.  Always be in contact with the Supreme Lord.  We are in the material world which is full misery and danger.  IF one does not always pray they will be in some sort of misery or danger.  The best way is to always be thinking of His Name fame glories.  And if we are in danger take shelter of His Name (Krishna, Allah, Jehovah, Rama, Vishnu etc.) One God many names. This is walking in the world but not being of it.

if you mean 'moonlight' its the reflection of sunlight bouncing off the moon surface.. . If you mean the glow that sometimes surrounds the moon like a halo its refraction of light through very high altitude clound cover. You can sometimes see a similar effect around the sun (also known as 'sun dogs' but dont know why!)

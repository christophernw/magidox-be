I think all forms of prejudice are on the rise and personally believe that it's all down to the current 'blame' culture that's so prevalent these days.. Crime - unemployment - housing problems arise and it's easy to blame ''them'' isn't it.. Forget your out of work because of poor qualifications etc - it's because of minorities.....and these idiots actually believe it!. Add that to the climate of fear the USA have created and there you go!. At the end of the day - we all bleed, there's no difference.

Apply for a secure credit card. You deposit like $200 and it gets applied to that card. It kind of defeats the purpose of a credit card, but it is one of the best ways to get credit. Most companies won't give you a card without some kind of credit. . . You could also open a checking account. Credit card companies look to see that you have an account with a steady balance, and that it's been maintained for a signifigant period of time (about 9 months, I think. I know it's less than a year). . . Also, you could get a phone line (house phone) put in your name. I got a regular house phone line put in my house when I didn't have any credit established, and all I had to was fax over a pay stub and my state ID. That was it. They gave me a phone number, and I paid it every month on time, and then I started receiving those "you're already approved" notifications. I received one of those for AT&T (for a cell phone), and figured I'd jump on that, too, because I had tried to open an account with them before I had anything in my name, and they said that I needed to put down a $500 security deposit because I didn't have any credit.. . Also, you can apply for a gas card. They give those pretty easily. Whatever you do, don't go around applying for every credit card company out there. The more credit inquiries that are made from companies, the more your credit score is lowered. . . I did the things listed above, and now I have so many cards, I'm a few grand in debt. Lol.

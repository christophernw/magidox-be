Being an Indian, I am not competent enough to answer the second part of the question. As for India, the pre-qualifications set forth by all the political parties for a contestant, are as follows: 1. The Contestant's money power 2. Religion/Caste 3. Criminal Record (the best criminal is one who does all the heinuous crimes yet does not figure in the police records). When such people are elected what do you expect from them. 1.They do anything for the sake of money because they want the best return on their investment during elections 2. Ensure that there is absolutely no communal harmony so as to keep their vote bank intact. 3. Encourage anti-social elements so as to protect their vested interests. . . In such a scenario, the only thing that comes to my mind is to change the whole electoral system. Whatever the Election Commission of India is doing right now is commendable but just not enough. They need to be given more powers rather brutal powers.

All trucks must stop at all open weigh stations.  If truckers are skipping them they are breaking the law and just hoping not to get caught.  I don't actually know of many truckers that do this because it will show up in their records, they have to keep signed paperwork from weightstations and the trucking companies can fire them for skipping stations and they can get a ticket.   My dad is a trucker and I ride with him every once and a while and he got pulled over for speeding and the officer pulled all his records, his last weigh station records and also his mileage log (they keep track of mileage to make sure that truckers are sleeping and not driving like 48 hours straight).  It's all very regulated.  My dad's truck has GPS tracking and his company keeps track to make sure he's where he's suppose to be, sleeping when he's suppose to and stopping at weigh stations when he's suppose to.

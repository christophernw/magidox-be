Humans and primates share a common ancestor. Eye colour is determined by genetics - one simple mutation can change the eye colour. There's nothing magical, mystical or spiritual about this... the mutation to create light coloured eyes ocurred after humans and other primates split from our most recent common ancestor during the process of evolution.. . Next question please

If that was true.... Everyone would be investing in Banks.. . Banks (since the 1980's) have done well.  That does not mean they will continue to do so.  Follow an "asset allocation" that works for you and get rich slowly.  READ READ READ. Learn investing. Don't use tips or information you've gotten from strangers (or most people you know).

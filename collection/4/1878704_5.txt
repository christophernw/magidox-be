It is a book now turning into a movie by Dan Brown. The premise is that Jesus had a girlfriend and there are artifacts of some sort that confirm this information. There is a secret society that Leo D'Vinci was in that protected these documents from the church who would destroy the evidence because it denounces the ideals of Jesus and in turn might lead people to stray from the church. Apparently D'Vinci hid clues to the artifacts in his paintings. The main character is a theologist and finds religious symbolism in the works to find the clues and save the artifacts. Good read, be intersted to see how it is converted.

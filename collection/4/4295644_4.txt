Pilates is a great way to strengthen your core muscles & lose weight.  Im sure your kids will keep you very active too. I have 4 children (1 plus a set of triplets!) My tummy looked like a deflated balloon for a while.  I too hated the way my belly looked but with a workout routine and good diet, I managed to get my pre- pregnancy shape back.  Concentrate on using your core in every thing you do all day long. With a little work, you'll get there.  Good luck!

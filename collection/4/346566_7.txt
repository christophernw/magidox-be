Get tested.  If you do have an STD you have a moral obligation to tell him.  If you slept with someone while you were going out with him you should be truthful with him.  If you slept with someone before him or during a period of breakup you don't have to tell him about it, but if you have an STD you should just sit him down and just tell him.  If you fear he'll become violent, make sure a friend is near.

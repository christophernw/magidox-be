We need to be very careful in distinguishing between legal with illegal immigration. we tend to generalize in our culture. yes they use some benefits they are not entitled to but they also buy goods and pay sales taxes, they help Americans make money , and to be honest an American wont ever work picking oranges, but the media doesn't talk about that, their figures don't take that into consideration..in this country its very easy to manipulate public opinion.. I think that we are afraid of Illegal immigration (Mexicans are just half of them, no body talks about them, but how ever since we generalize so much Mexicans) for many reasons: 1.-they don't try to adapt to our culture or do so very slowly (but we don't accept those who try either)  2.-most of them coming here have very little education and we assume they are criminals (yes they broke the law, but also by speeding you are braking the law and that does not make you a criminal)   3.- there are too many of them and they will keep coming its inevitable (a wall--nonsense,military-nonsense) so we are so afraid because is something we will have to deal with either we like it or not..I think immigration should be allowed but controlled in a way that wont affect our economy.

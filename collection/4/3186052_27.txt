The real question is - - - what is your purpose.  The purpose to life is different for everyone.  The basic purpose I believe is to learn as much as we can (spiritually), and secondarily to discover what our individual purpose is here.  You have one, you just haven't discovered it yet.  It would be a long story to tell you how to do that.  But, start off by thinking about what it is that you have enjoyed doing (I mean for the betterment of yourself and those around you) all your life, then build on that.

From my humble understandings.... . Muhammed was to have wrote the Koran (Quaran) with the actual guidance of Michael (the archangel).  There is a passage in the bible prophecy about one coming later to deceive and included an angel in the prophecy.  Don't know the exactness of it though.. . Also, in order to understand what Muhammed wrote you need to read the Tabari and Isaaq.  They are two biographies wrote after Muhammed about his life and his writings (Koran).  Those writings are very similar in what they say - and they conclude that Muhammed was possessed by demons when he was writing the Koran.. . Which is why some deny the two biographies.  But, they are needed to provide a context for the Koran - else you can't make any sense of it.  And, because without those two the world is silent for eight generations (800 years) about Islaam and Muhammed.

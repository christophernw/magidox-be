blah blah blah....distilled water tastes like that because of the distillation process.  Distillation means that they heat the water up until it turns into steam, (like a the operation of a radiator) and then collect the steam, cool it so it turns back into water.. . Distillation reduces the number of impurities in water because they cant rise into steam with the water, they are left behind.  It makes for an interesting taste though.

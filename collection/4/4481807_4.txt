In a 2 part drink, i.e. a vodka or gin martini(with vermouth as the other part) for example, the drier it is, the less of the mixer is put into the cocktail. I drink xtra dry martinis, and they skip the vermouth altogether, bless their souls. . Dry & xtra dry sherry, champagne, etc refer to the wine being less (or not at all) sweet.

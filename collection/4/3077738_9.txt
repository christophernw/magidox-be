First ask the question on Yahoo Answers. Then disregard any answer that doesn't instruct you to approach your dilemma logically.. Step 1 -- Is this door you wish to open a physical barrier or a metaphorical barrier? If you aren't sure please ask your Lifeskills teacher about it.. Step 2 -- After you determine what type of door you want/need open please do a wants/needs analysis.. If it is a want please restate your question with" I want to open a door" then apply "you can't always get what you want" to your question Answer -- You can't find out how to open a door.. If it is a need, please restate your question with " I need to open a door" then apply "you get what you need" to your question. Answer -- You get to know how to open the door.  The door should tell you when you ask it -- if not the door then someone standing by the door will tell you how to open that door.

i feed mine and any cat i need to fatten up( i do cat rescue)purina kitten chow soaked and sofened in enough warm water to cover the amount on the plate and then i mix in some kitten wet canned food, about 1/4 of a can. leave in any water after soaking the cruchies as it will have some of the flavor in it and will help keep kitten hydrated. make sure she has plenty of fresh water down at all times. you should probably feed her 3-4 times a day. you will be able to guage just how much she will eat each time after watching her for a few feedings. she might enjoy a treat of "cat" milk that you can buy in small cartons from the pet or grocery tore. do not give her regular milk. also if you use canned food and store any left overs in the fridge make sure y ou cover it and when it comes time to feed it to her warm it in the microwave before mixing it with the crunchies. cold food gives kittens tummy aches that may show up alll over your floors if you give it to her cold. kittens need the warmth of the food to aid in digestion.. i have rescued and raised many kittens from newly born to adult.. email me if you have any questions;. kaylamay64@yahoo.com. enjoy your baby. love and protect her always and she will repay you in kind over and over. spay her when she is old enough.. ps. no table food. well maybe a little chicken or beef(plain) as a treat, but best to feed cat food or you will make a rod for your back!

The 600,000 number is bogus.  It was produced by the same people who did a similar study (also released just before a US election) that stated that 100,000 people were killed.  Since no other researcher was able to duplicate the 100,000 number this counts as 'bad science.'  . . The 600,000 number is nothing but propaganda that people accept because it supports their political biases.

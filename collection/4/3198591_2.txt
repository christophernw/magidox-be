keep it simple. that's the basic rule in the kitchen.. . season both sides with kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper.. heat a skillet until it gets very hot over med-high heat.. place the chops in the skillet, i don't use fat when I make mine. the chops will release from the pan when they are ready to turn.. let them sear for at least 2 minutes to get a good dark crust. then turn. you have a couple of options from here. you can put them in a 350F oven until they are done or lower the heat on the stove top and continue cooking. you need to cook them to an internal temp of at least 165F for 15 seconds. it is acceptable to have a slight blush of pink. not raw but a pink haze. trichinosis is not huge concern anymore so you don't have to cook them until they turn to shoe leather.

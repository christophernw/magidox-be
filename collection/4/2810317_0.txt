Unless you are this person's parent, you don't have the right to upgrade anyone. . . If this is a your romantic partner, why did you choose them if you want to change them? It is hoped that if you fall in love with someone it will be because of who they are, and not who you hope they will be after you get done with them.. . Maybe some further information from you would help here. I am bothered by your question as it is currently written.

I had a friend in college who did that. She was hurting on the inside from deep wounds of the past.  She decided to talk openly with her family, and much to her surprise and joy, she found her family accepting her and helping her to get the help she needed.  She now is a successful therapist helping others.  Things turn out well if walk towards health,,,good luck and I will light a candle for you.

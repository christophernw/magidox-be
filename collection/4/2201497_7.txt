Adoption is the best option!. . My miracle baby was a gift from a woman who found herself pregnant and couldn't care for him. She wanted him to go to a home where he would be given love. This was a very unselfish decision on her part. I will always be thankful to her for her unselfish act of love. If she had been selfish, I would of never been able to experience the most wonderful experience of being my son's mom. My son is now 23 yrs old and still is and will always be my miracle :)

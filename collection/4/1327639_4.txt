I think you mean "suru" and not "saru". Saru is a plate/monkey.. . And I would translate it as "I love you with all my heart" because "ai suru" would be "to love in the most romantic way possible" and "kokoro" is the heart.. Although "kara" is more of a "from" meaning, "I love you from all my heart" doesn't sound as nice.

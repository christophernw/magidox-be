Lena...if you clip the kitty's nails and glue on the Soft Paws that will help lessen the damage to your carpet.  Also give her extra scratching pads that lie horizontal because some cats are also horizontal scratchers rather than vertical scratchers.  It's hard to squirt them with water if your sleeping so this helps.  You can put sticky tape on the carpet too because cats hate their toes stuck to the tape.

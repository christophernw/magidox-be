I try to be nice to people no matter how they look, ugly, extremely attractive, I try to treat everyone the same, with the same amount of respect and kindness that I know they deserve and the same way I would like to be treated. I'm sure that sounds slightly cliched, but it's true. I think regardless of how people look or how they feel about themselves, they try to treat people well. That's what everyone wants, is to be treated kindly. Now whether peoples interaction with you affect the way you behave, I think it's true, in some ways. If you are treated poorly, you're more likely to treat people in a nasty manner. I think what it affects most is the way you feel about yourself. Trust me, I've had people be nasty to meet and you wonder why or what it is about that caused them to react that way. But I don't take those things out on other people.

What a stupid question.  You can never have enough beer.  It's the body that's the problem man! all of our problem, we need bodies that can stand up and be counted so that we all can finally have as you would say "enough beer".  Until we evolve into this perfect being without limitation to the consumption of beer then we will never be free.  Do you understand?. Unless off course you're a light weight and of ya tits on a few pints.

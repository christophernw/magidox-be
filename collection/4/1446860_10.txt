I have not yet met a fanatical atheists, they generally quiet about their beliefs. It's the other fanatic's that turn me into a Lizzie Bordon person. Atheist's don't knock on YOUR door trying to convert you. Atheist's don't stand on a street corner in a suit and tie, trying to convert YOU. Atheists don't stand in a group wearing white and shaking tambourines trying to convert YOU. You don't hear about atheist's blowing up building's nor people. So where exactly are these fanatical atheists?

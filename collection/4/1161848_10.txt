Dachshunds shut everything down, yo.  They were actually bred with those long bodies and long tails so they could go after badgers in those burrowed tunnels they live in.  So the Dachshund's tail is long so you can just yank em out of the hole.  How cute is that?!  Just pulling your dog out of a hole by its tail while it destroys a badger!  Definately ill, son.

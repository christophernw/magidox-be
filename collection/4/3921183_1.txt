It could have been a very early miscarriage, but it is hard to tell. Most miscarriages happen without the person even knowing, as it occurs so early in the pregnancy. You could have had a miscarriage after 4 full weeks, but it would have happened because something was not quite right - this is common. Maybe you should discuss this with your doctor and they will check you over.

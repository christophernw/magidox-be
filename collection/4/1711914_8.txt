It seems people with similar interests will seek like topics.. . Schneb and I seem to have had our "run ins." . . Personally, I like these topics because they expose individual personalities.  We all believe in something higher and are quite adamant about our views.. . Some can adjust their views when the evidence mounts, others can not.

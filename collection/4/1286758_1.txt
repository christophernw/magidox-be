You didn't mention if your cat is eating and acting normally otherwise.  If the answer is no, I would take her to the vet and get her checked out.. . If everything else is normal, it could be that she is disturbed if you are getting up and down with the baby a lot.  Or, she may just be 'being a cat' and choosing somewhere different for a change.  . . When she gets in the baby's bouncy chair, either she finds it comfortable or, she finds the smell of the baby comforting.

not entirely true. the chinese fondness for pork, really fatty parts of the porker, offals contribute more than weight - high cholesterol which is even worse.. . of course most chinese cuisine DO NOT make use of milk, cream, or any other dairy-related products in their everyday diet so that helps to 'reduce' as well. drinking chinese tea (no sugar, no creamer) is also a factor in 'weight control'.

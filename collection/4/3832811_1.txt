That depends on who you ask.  It's equal to 1/3 the area of the top of your foot, so with different people you'll come up with different answers.  I wear a 10 1/2 wide, so the lattice parameter of my Ni3Mn is probably around 4 1/2 square inches.    It's typically better to keep the lattice on your salad and off your feet anyway.

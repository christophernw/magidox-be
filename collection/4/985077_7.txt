Traditionally, a child of mixed race is considered black if at least one great-great-grandparent is black.  It's called the "one-sixteenth rule".  Of course, this rule is archaic and echoes back to antebellum laws regarding slaves.  . . More modernly, the child could be termed mullato, creole, or simply "mixed", but any of these terms can be considered derogatory in certain settings.. . Frankly, I'd say go with whichever she resembles more closely.  Agencies will be looking for appearance for particular roles.  If she has more caucasoid features, list white.  If she has predominantly negroid features, list black.  That should give her the best shot at getting cast.  . . Good luck to you and your daughter!

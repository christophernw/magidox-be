Yes, use your portfolio to showcase your works and sell yourself so to speak.  Be sure to put in a variety of media and be able to explain the significance and elements used in each piece.  Organization helps, and you don't have to spend a load of money on it, but make sure the presentation is simple and not too dynamic, because this takes away from your selling point:  your art.  good luck!

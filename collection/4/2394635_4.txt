Ok. A SERIOUS answer to your question (not just an opinion of your dog licking you) If it is a constant licking (like almost obsessive) it is a sign of being territorial...in a sense. There are a few ways to fix this. For one, when they lick you without your invitiation, a snap on the nose and a firm NO might get the point across. . Train him to lick you on command. When he licks you, say "good boy, gimme kisseys" or whatever you want. When you dont give the command and he licks you, tell him no. This will give him the idea of when it's right and when its wrong.. Also, a good idea would be to put him in submissive position, because obsessive licking does have a tendency to be territorial. Submissive position, if you're unaware, is something they do in dog packs where the Alfa (you) challanges the lower (your dog) by putting him on his back and staring into his eyes until he looks away. when you do this, keep a firm pressure on his chest. Since hes a bigger dog, you might need your knee. Do this until he calms and looks away, even if he cries. YOu might even notice how he will listen to you more after this. All your doing is telling him that you are the boss, and he has to do what you say. DOnt worry...This happens in dog packs all the time. It wont hurt him; your just thinking like him :D . good luck!

There is a timing element that you are forgetting.. You are probably young, healthy, intelligent, capable, independent, and probably a little proud of those things. Not many of us begin life recognizing our fragile, vulnerableness. It takes time and experience, and an honest heart to admit to these things. Most don't or should I say won't. The pride seems to keep growing even when we stop. It blinds us to our weaknesses and faults. Everyone else is aware. When your life encounters events that shake your invincibility ...then re-consider that "failed" prayer. God doesn't listen to words ....He is intent upon the heart. He will be as sincere as you are.

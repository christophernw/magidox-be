Reading broadens the mind! . Reading sets your mind free! . No film-of-the-book is EVER better than the book itself! (read "The Lord of the rings", and all the "Harry Potter" books to prove that to yourself). . When you read fiction, your mind paints the picture that the words convey, and when you read non fiction, you learn. . When you read, you need to concentrate in a way that you do not do when you watch or listen, so you absorb far more of the wisdom from the page. . And besides that, Reading is really good fun.

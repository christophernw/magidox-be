what about them?. . If you feel and see that you may have them, you have to go to the Dr. To get them off.. This is talking about the STD warts.. . . Girls-- If they are on the outter, then you can have them burned off, or froze off... You can be given a cream to use at home.. You aply it, leave it on for 8 hours then wash it off.. It burns them and it takes them off. Being careful not to over do the amount, it causes burns and skin rash if you are not carfeul.. Very painful... If these at home treatments dont work and they are more on the inside, then you would maybe have a lazer surgry.. That is painful, but you are sleeping, and out of the hospital that day.. Not being able to left weights of heavy things for a few days. . . Guys-- Having them on the outer side is easy to see.. Same thing, go to Dr. only way to get hem to go aways... . Once you have this, it's always going to be with you.. Even though you do not see them, and you have taken care of it by the dr., you can still have them.. They come and go.. (kinda like cold sores, you will alwyas have them, even if you do not see them.) Just cause you got them and you feel lift out in the world, you are not alone.. You have to be careful not to have sex or foreplay when you are having an out-break of them.. It's not safe..

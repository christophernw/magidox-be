Solid melts into liquid and liquid evaporates into gas when the temperature is raised. So we reverse the process nitrogen gas is supercooled or compressed in an airtight container, the nitrogen molecules come closer together and gas finally turns to liquid. But when liquid nitrogen is exposed to room temperature it immediately becomes heated and immediately becomes smoke or gas

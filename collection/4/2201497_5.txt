I think adoption is the best bet.  Unfortunately, SOOOO many people these days are just abandoning their babies!  So much so, that they have made certain areas "acceptable" places to drop off a baby, no questions asked.  Not sure if you've heard about it... but people are able to legally abandon a newborn (or probably any child actually, but it's generally newborns) at a hospital, fire hall and I think church.  This sounds horrible... but it's an attempt by these agencies to end the practice of "dumpster babies"... where people simply toss them in a trash can or leave them in a public restroom, etc.  At least by making certain areas (which are staffed 24/7) available, it ensures that the baby will be immediately taken and cared for... much better than the alternative.  I think everyone is aware of adoption, but unfortunately, not everyone is aware of the fairly new baby abandonment laws.  We have to remember that it's the very "bottom of the barrel" so to speak that needs to know about this policy (where it's okay to leave a baby).  People with money and/or education know their options already (generally speaking)... it's the severely impoverished, the extremely young and even the mentally unstable that are typically those "dumping" babies.  Teens who hide their pregnancy the entire time and somehow feel it's better to dump the child than to let down their parents...  . . Anyway... just a policy that's fairly new that needs to be publicized more.  I'm NOT saying it's okay to abandon your baby.  You should make plans LONG before it's birth (whether it be abortion - which I don't advocate!-, adoption, etc).  Like others have said, really it's something you should be "prepared" for before having sex... but that's VERY unlikely in today's society.  I'm just saying... I'd rather see a baby handed over to a nurse at a hospital than left alone to die in a cold trash can on the street.

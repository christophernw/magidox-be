I believe growing up without a dad sometimes has the opposite effect on young men.  Instead of them wanting to provide that love and care there fathers could not. They sometimes replicate the same pattern.  And for the record, I have a mixed array fo friends and your insane if you dont think young white dads are just a deadbeat.

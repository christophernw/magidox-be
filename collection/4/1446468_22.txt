Well,my first screenname was Taralynn14 which was named after my all time favorite barbie doll ( I was a collector) and my age, then when I because 15 I wanted a new name and tried for ImHyPeR247 but that was taken so I settled for Hyperme408 because it was pretty close... then I graduated college and decided I was too old to have such a childish name so I changed it to Loryndebra because thats my first and middle name and so it works for personal and for business mail.

well my first suggetstion would be try to every once and awhile go to a sauna and after u r done there go take a shower but be sure it is cold.and the second one is go to a website called www.thebodyshop.com and look for a product called tea tree oil treatment. and if you like it you might consider ordering it you can pretty much find it in malls and that sort of stuff.my third suggestion would be dont eat too much sugar or else u will break out

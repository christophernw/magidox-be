New York is like a mixed Chocolate, you got your Hard ones and you got your good sweet ones, go try out the PUBs or the bars near the 5 or 6 avenue and stay with in PAth or Metros area, you will also find that going with friends; you are more likely to enjoy and maybe you can bring a "one-night-stand"  i know i did ... Enjoy the greatest City in the Americas ! If you can't find the place just walk up to a lovely lady and ask her that you and some friends are looking to relax at a bar and try to invite her, your doing 2 things at once, so new york is a very resourceful place.

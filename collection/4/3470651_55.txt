well it is caused by the fact that there is less humidity that during other parts of the year. the lack of humidity means there is less static discharged to the air around you and thus more stays built up in or more properly on you.  when leaving your car you might( if you're balance is good ) try closing the car door with your foot. follow me here. as you get out you place one foot on the ground you then place you then place your other one beside it. try reaching back (with the first leg) and closing the door. this process can be refined to an art in time and it's especially handy when you've got your hands full.

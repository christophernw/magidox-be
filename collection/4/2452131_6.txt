If it is electronic , it might be difficult.. . But you can always install a "shunt" so current bypasses the meter, and the meter either stops runningorruns very slowly.It is illegal though, and dangerous as well. Never did it.. . Why not try to use less electricity, makesure that thereare no leaks, Use CFL , flourescent tubes, instead of bulbs, not leave gadgets ( Even your mobile charger) running unnecessarily , especially switch off TV rather than just pressing the power button on the remote.

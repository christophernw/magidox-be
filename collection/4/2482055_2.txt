Aromatic hydrocarbons have a high electron density due to the pi cloud of electrons which exist.  They hence undergo electrophilic substitution, that is they are attacked by an electrophile.. . An electrophile is an electron-loving particle, such as the positive ions and other alkyl groups (CH3, C2H5).

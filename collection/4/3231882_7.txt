The area that your budgie is chewing at sounds like it could be his preening gland. This would indicate some kind of problem, such as an infection of the gland. Regardless where your budgie is bleeding from, he definitely has some kind of physiological problem, either an illness, infection, or deficiency. You need to take him to an avian veterinarian as soon as possible, as his health and life is at stake. You can use the website http://www.aav.org/vet-lookup to look up an avian vet in your area.

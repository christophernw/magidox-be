Hang out with ugly people. LOL...To have pure confidence, you have to believe in yourself and be proud of what you have and not ashamed of what you don't. Most people have a little confidence in them, but what brings them down usually is the fact that instead of focusing on their positives, they focus on their flaws. Just remember when one part of you says "yeah, I really am a great ?????" don't let the other part of you say "well, I could improve ?????".

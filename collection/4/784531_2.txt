Hi there,. . Because of the H2S. And of course Sulfur stinks.. There's a lot of H2S in asparagus. . . Of course you can not smell it when you hold your nose close to one, but when your food digests, the H2S is released and you can smell it. . . I don't think many scientists will start smelling their urine now... but that's the explanation I heard on the radio once.

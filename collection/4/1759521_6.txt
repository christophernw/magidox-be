Because these old farts in DC have the misconception that if it is legal then everyone would just smoke weed all day, nothing will get done, and the US will go into turmoil. . . THC is not an addictive substance. Nicotine is far worse for you. Once the initial hype of the legalization occurs, ppl will use it in moderation just like alcohol(with is far worse to the body than marijuana)

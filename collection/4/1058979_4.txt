Like a computer, there are basically 3 component in memory:. . Input -> processing/storage -> output/retrieval. . All our sensory information if coming from our sensory organ eyes- the retina, or the sensory receptor in our skin, or auditory info like the a piece of music.. . These raw information is then transmit (through nerves and the spinal cord) to the major sensory relay know as the Thalamus. The information is then process in to many different nuclei. One of them would be the structure known as the Hippocampus (know as the gateway of memory) It is this structure that give the the RAMs. It store information for about 20 min (why 20 mins? that is explain by the resonance frequency of the neuron in that structure, which I could not explain in just a few words). . Anyways, during this short amount of time, parts of the cortex, will translate these signals (basically binary on/off of neuro impulses or 0s and 1s) into a internal representation. Since we don't have pens and papers in our brain we use somethings else. . . Cells- not just any cell, we use neuron. And only a special part of it know as the dendrites more specifically the dentric spines. Each Neuron can have up to 1000 dendrite and each dendrite have 7 to 10 spines. Since we have 10^12 cells in the brain (though only 10% are neuron the other are glail cells) that's a lot of spine.. . So what are we going to do with the spines you may ask.. Each spine, make a connection with another neuron, creating a very very complex neuronal circuit and each new circuit would represent a new memory

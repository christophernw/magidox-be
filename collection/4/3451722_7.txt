It took me 3 years, but my cat no longer does that. She would do it every night when we would go up the stairs to go to bed. I started bringing a squirt bottle with me when I would go upstairs and I would squirt her and say "NO!" in a very loud voice (I'm sure the neighbors appreciated it). I really thought she would never learn, but eventually she stopped doing it. Now she just runs up the stairs in front of me without the evil gleam in her eye. I guess it was a kitten thing.

My God, is this such an imposition. Will yuor life fall apart because you have to bag your own groceries? Do you now stand aimlessly around at the check-out waiting for a bag person to appear? Sorry for my cynicism, but your comment makes me think that we as western society need to re-think our priorities at a time when AIDS is leaving literally millions of children as orphans in Africa, Indonesia is decaying under unremitting natural disasters and our climate is being twisted and turned every which way. C'mon, there are more important things than worrying about the bag packing problems at your local store!

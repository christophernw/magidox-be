The United States paid 15 million to purchase the land which is 3 cents an acre.  By owning the Louisiana purchase we opened up the Mississippi for increase trade. The French could control a lot of our trade because they owned New Orleans at the mouth of the Mississippi.  We doubled in size which encouraged exploration (Louis and Clark)and expansion. The land was used to further push the Indians west.  It put more pressure on the Spanish to sell Florida.  Down the road it increased our natural resources and food production.

A chinchilla is a very cute little animal from the rodent family. They are very furry and about the size of a guinea pig. Altho they are very cute, they are not very smart. I've also heard that they can frequently be too skittish to hold without being bitten. I know lots of people are going to say this isn't true, but I have never known anyone who had a friendly one.

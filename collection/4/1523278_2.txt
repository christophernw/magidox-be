Unfortunately, unlike a Purchase Money Mortgage, in a Contract for Deed you cannot take title to the property until the Contract is completely satisfied and all payments have been fully made.  If you have not fulfilled all duties under the Contract, you must do so in order to sell the property.  If you fail to do so, you have no right to the property and are forfeiting the monies already expended under the Contract for Deed.  Good luck, I hope it works out.  The only other suggestion I can make is to assign the remainder of the Contract for Deed to another individual under whatever terms you can agree to, but that's only if the original Contract for Deed allows assignment...

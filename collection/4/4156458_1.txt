It's a class thing.. I would imagine it is something to do with 1066 when the Normans landed in Pevensey Bay and re-distributed the land between their cronies.  To this day the great landowners of Britain are only the landowners they are because they sold out to the French in 1066.  Oh, and they killed Harold!. But a lot of British just adore the French ways, so much they chose to move to France or at least have a second property there.

There are many causes, and it is hard to determine one particular "cause."  At that time the power of the emporer was declining quickly because the people who assumed the role were unable to fulfill the duties required of them.  The Bishop of Rome was actually stealing power from the Emperor and denying him communion for executing Romans.  There was also a shortage of people in the army, and so people were hired to fight for the romans (attila the hun is a famous one of these).  Consequently the military advantage that Rome had previously had declined also.  In addition it was difficult with the technology available to rule such a large area with out the ability to quickly move from one spot to another. Other groups were growing larger.  Finally the Roman supply of income also drastically decreased for two reasons a. the failure to take over more land and steal and pillage their property and b. the shift of trade farther and farther east.  Basically they went on the defensive instead of staying on the offensive.

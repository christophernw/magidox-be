When there is no sin.  People are inherently sinful and will continue to do bad things and unfortunately, racism is one of those things.  It's a choice and I think the only way people will stop choosing to be racist is maybe when the world finally ends??? Ha ha, I don't know....it all depends on what you believe in.

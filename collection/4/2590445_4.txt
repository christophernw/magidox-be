and... the condom can come off pretty easily too, which i had to find out the hard way!!! it's pretty important that he keeps checking to make sure it's on, or if he atleast checks before he cums.. . i'm not sure if the sponge is compatible with condoms, make sure you read all the directions and warnings. certain creams and foams can eat away at the condom and make it useless. . . but make sure of course that YOU are ready, your heart and head and what not. :)

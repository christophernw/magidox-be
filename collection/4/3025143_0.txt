If your 1995 Grand Am has a serpentine belt then you do not have to take off any mounts. All you need is a long 3/8 inch breaker bar to release the tension of the tensioner pulley and the belt will slip off. Just make sure that your route the new belt exactly as the old belt. Once you have made sure the belt is routed and seated properly, you can release the tensioner and it will tighten the belt. Run the engine to make sure all your accesories work and that the belt is tracking properly

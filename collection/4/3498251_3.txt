The is no easy way sorry i tried it ( no easy way without surgury, lipo, or pills) with ar enot healthy.  i know everyone is gonna tell u to do situps so im gonna tell u try to do excersice weigths, sit ups, eat healthy because usually all the sugar chocolat and fattie acids from junk food go straigh to ur stomach. I had to have a flat belly by this summer because i went to florida and ill i did was eat a good breakfast and a small healthy lunch, and a medium supper. i worked out and didn;t eat any junkfood,chocolat, and i did alot of situps and scawts.

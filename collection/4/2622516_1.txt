For the person who ansered with ??????. Hickok was shot in the back at Saloon no. 10 in Deadwood South Sakota while playing poker and the hand he had when shot is referred to as the Dead Man's Hand.  Some people see the hand as bad luck and some also believe this episode is why many males prefer to sit facing entryways and doors while at restaurants.  (normally 60-70% of men do this)

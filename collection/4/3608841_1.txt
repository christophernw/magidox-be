Your concern and/or question is moot, given the fact there is no draft currently.  The question of weather women would be drafted in the event the US began drafting, is probably one that is yet to be decided.  My guess is no.  I believe that enough volunteer women would step forward in the event a draft was initiated.  I cannot answer for women's rights groups except to say, until there is a draft there really isn't much fodder for an argument!

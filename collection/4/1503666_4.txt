Well this will be my suggestion to you as u are still in 1 year u should basically aim on your studies. While living in Delhi you have to take care of what ever u do.. cauz in a competative world you can't stand with a support and education is all that we all need i am pg student and i am doing job in TCS on basis of my Graduation. Still if u want to do job then just try to improve your connections and let people know about u. 2) Never Place any demand from your side, 3) never let your boss or any subordinate to cross your limits 4) do what ever job is assigned to you till the time u feel it is not hurting your dignity and self respect 5) Leave the Job as the time u get a better job than previous one 6) never ever make friends in OFFICE cause they will stop your growth and won't allow you to achieve somethng and still if u need some answer u can mail me any time at my id.

The "Amber Alert" is a general alert put out, usually by the media, to alert Americans at large of a missing child.. . "Code Adam" is a term used by Wal-Mart and its affiliates (Sam's Club, etc.) to announce to employees when a child is lost in the store. At this point the store goes on virtual lockdown while the employees look for the child.. . Both involve missing children - but you will generally only hear of a Code Adam inside a Wal-Mart store.

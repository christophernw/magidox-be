If Christian fundamentalists are as bad as the Islamic bombers, then why aren't you taking the next plane out of town, fleeing in abject terror?  There must be at least a church on every block of your city, but you sit there, in the comfort of your own cozy surroundings, and say within your own conceit that you find no difference between them?  Let's face it,  there is no danger from the fundamentalists, unless, of course, the hospitals they create are another danger to yourself!

the world began with a supernatural force or a big bang.First there were animals and that was cool.Than man began to roam the earth and reign over the animals. Than they began to spread out accrossed the earth each learning to speak a separate language. For a while all was good. Than when they saw the land that others had that spoke a different language they liked it better and were jealous. They couldn't sneak in cuz they looked and talked different and weren't excepted. So they began to fight and kill each other, and that's about  it.

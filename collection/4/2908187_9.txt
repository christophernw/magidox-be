Some law enforcement departments will allow you to call to verify if you have any warrants by phone.  You will have to provide your full name, date of birth, and sometimes your SSN.. . While others will not verify by phoneand they advise you to come to their station to verify it in person.. . This is, at least, how it works in Missouri.

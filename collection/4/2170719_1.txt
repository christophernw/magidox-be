What scares me the most is the stupid answers you get on this site.  First check for a timing mark on your crank shaft pulley.  Then check for a guide that should be near it.  Looks like a little plate with numbers on it.  Kind of sticks out about an inch or two.  That plate should have numbers on it.  Numbers with + or - by them.  OK, now that you've found that,get a timing light.  Looks like a little gun that has three wires coming off of it.  The probe end goes around number 1 spark plug wire and the others go to the battery.  Start the car and point the light at the little plate.  You should see a line (the mark on your crank pulley) that is lining up with those numbers.  Very lightly loosen the bolt that hold the distributor down.  Maybe just 1/4 to 1/2 turn.  You might want to do this before you start the car.  OK car running, distributor loose, turn the distributor slightly to get that line to +6.  When there, turn car off.  Tighten the bolt and you are done.  Oh yeah, one more thing.  Take the vacuum line off the distributor before you start.  That will throw this hold process off.  Don't forget to put it back on when you are done.  Hope this helps.

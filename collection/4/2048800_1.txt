I think I know what you are asking.  Are you wondering if your calling is to become a full-fledged priest?  If yes, then I would say, the answer lies deep within you.   Sometimes his answers come in ways that we least expect it.  I say this to you, You ask in your question, " How do I guarantee myself that I am called", and my response to you is this: where in life are we ever given a guarantee about anything?  My parents always taught me you make your own guarantee.  If this is something you know you'll love, if your heart draws you to this, if you have asked the Lord, and you've been answered that this is your way, then pursue it with all your heart, and make it happy.  You'll be the guarantee, with the Lord's help, of course!

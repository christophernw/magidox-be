well if you don't smoke hunni ask your friend if she wants a cigarette please go out side or in the kitchen and have some insense or scented candles. . . i smoke and i light insense at home at its alot more pleasant, but i do not smoke in people's houses unless they themselves smoke as i don't think it is polite, it is after all a smelly habit.. .  ITS YOUR PLACE AND YOU MAKE THE RULES. tell  your friend not to smoke in your house.

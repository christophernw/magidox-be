interesting thought here.  now, many ppl dont believe in god or satan, but lets take a look at the bible's history of satan.. . he started out as Lucifer, the angel of light, one of the most important angels. he became jealous of mankind because they had God's favor of the angels. so he rebels, and loses. is cast out of heaven, and becomes Satan, the devil. . . now, according to the bible, God knows everything, and can do anything. i'm assuming that means he knows the future before it happens. if he knew that Lucifer was going to turn into Satan, is it really Satan's fault that he's such a bad guy? i mean, if i build a robot, and program it to bring me lunch everyday for a year, and then after that it's programmed to stab me, is it the robot's fault? or the fault  of the programmer?. . Now, i'm sure someone is gonna say that God gives us freedom of choice, and that our actions are for us to decide. but if God truly knows all, he knows what we're gonna do ahead of time. so do we really have choice, or is out fate predetermined? did Lucifer really become evil, or was that the path God chose for him ahead of time?. . just my thoughts.

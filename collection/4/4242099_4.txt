there are thirteen laws of Karma. As you sow, so shall you reap.. You attract what you are, not what you want.. What you resist, persists for you.. Where ever you go, there you are.. Whenever there is something wrong, there is something wrong in us.. Whatever you do may be very insignificant, but it is very important that you do it. . You can't think two things at the same time. . If you believe something to be true, then sometime in life you must demonstrate that truth.. You can't go home again, but you must try.. the more things change, the more they stay the same.. When you focus on your life, good things happen.. What you put in, you get back.. Letting go, We don't truly have something until we can give it away. Give out more love, see if you don;'t et more in return, let others be right and gain more Ego.

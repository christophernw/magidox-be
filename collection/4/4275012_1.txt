first of all the dogs that the public and media report as being pitbulls arent ! there usally crossed out with some other kind of dog thats a kerr or should i say a chicken ! the types of dog that bite people do so out of fear and pure bred pitbulls arent scared of anything! most importantly if every one is suggesting that pitbull fighters train there dogs to bite people , that wouldnt make any sense ! i mean isnt there people in the ring when these dogs are fighting ? once again if any dog bites some one and does alot of damage then its automatically a pitbull and i dont think thats fair to the breed . especially the purebred pitbull .

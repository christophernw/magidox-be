Why am I happy?. . Because the jokers that have been screwing up are out.  And I will again vote against the Republicans in the 2008 elections.. . And getting out of Iraq is the strategy - even GW was speaking of an "exit strategy" right before the elections.  Even the military sees that Iraq is nothing but a bad dream.  They have no monopoly on terrorist insurgents - they are all over the middle east.  Matter of fact, since we went into Iraq, the last place the "terrorists" are right now is in Iraq.  That is just PR speaking to your little sheepish mind.. . It is a sad day in America.  You are right on that.  But it is sad because it took the Republicans having their asses handed to them in an election to realize that the American public was dissatisfied with them, and the government, and they want something to change right now.  That is the only reason the Democrats are now in office.  If they don't perform during this time, I see the public really griping at the next elections.. . Here's your tissue, Alice.  Now quit your crying and figure out how to fix things.  It isn't about Republican and Democrat anymore, but about getting something done that will work for the American people.  It's that easy.

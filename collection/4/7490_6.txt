First take a good look at yourself. Who am I,where do I want to be, what do I want to be? Ask GOD for his hand to walk along with you in your time of need. GOD will be with you when no one else will,I promise. GOD will fogive you for all the things you have done. You must remember ,he who helps themselfs, will truly find the help they need.

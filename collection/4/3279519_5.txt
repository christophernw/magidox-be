I have suffered from depression for 10 years, and only recently (last 6 months) went to see a professional and started medication.  Why do you not want to take depression meds?  From experience, they really, really help, even if the depression is minor.  But, to fight depression without meds, here are some suggestions.. 1. Hug someone at least once a day.  The touch of another person can do amazing things to help you.. 2. Please talk to someone you really trust, and tell them how you are feeling, don't be shy or embarrased about it.  I am a teacher and you would not believe how many students have confided in me that they suffer from varying levels of depression.. 3. Find something you like to do/ are good at, and do it at least once a week.  I know this can be hard to do when you are depressed and down, but there has got to be at least one thing you LOVE to do.  For me its singing with my church choir.. 4. Don't try to hide who you are by pretending to be happy and cheerful 100% of the time.  This really does only make things worse.. 5. At first your friends may have some trouble processing how to handle you.  Talk to them individually and explain whats happening, because again from experience, when no one else seems to understand you, a good friend will, and you will need these people to support you to beat this.. . You can do it, I have faith in you.  Good Luck!!

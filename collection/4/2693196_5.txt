You are never dedicated to do something you have complete confidence in. No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it's going to rise tomorrow. When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kind of dogmas or goals, it's always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.  . . It takes the intellectual mind to recognize the existense of these truths and then be willing to sacrifice the warm fuzzies of the promise of a secure afterlife for the truth of reality.

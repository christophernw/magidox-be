Your illusions were shattered!. . Lightning struck!. . Thunder crashed!. . And the world was destroyed as you know it.. . There is HOPE, however, for the cupless.  Yes, hope, I say!  At your local Wal-Mart, there is a certain aisle.  You have to be very careful going to the aisle because others are beginning to know it's closely-guarded secret as well.. . Sneak up on the new cup of your choice, guide it directly to your eagerly waiting basket of non-essentials and take yon cup home to be shoved on a cabinet shelf to be lost in all the other cups you have lurking up there.

OMG!!  You've given me the munchies now!!. . I think a quick nip to Tescos is on the cards!!. . However, if you're in the UK have you tried Marks & Spencers Triple Berry Muffins?. . I GUARANTEE you will be addicted to them!!! . . On second thoughts, sack Tescos, I'll wait till tomorrow and do an M&S trip!. . You little belter!  This time tomorrow, I'll be sinkin' me teeth into the soft buttery sponge and the berries will be oozing out down the front of my top!!  Can't wait!!

I suppose the theoretical answer is because it is summertime down here in the Southern Hemisphere from beginning December through to end February. In actual practice I dont believe it has ever happened that December 25th has been the hottest day. On average both January and February have higher average temperatures than December. AND I cant remember the last time Christmas day wasn't bl..dy awful weather. But having said that its a great place to visit anytime of the year - so come on down!! :-)

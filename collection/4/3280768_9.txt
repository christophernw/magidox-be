I don't think that is true.  I don't hate any religion.  And I don't think the majority of the American people do either.. The majoriy of the Muslims I have met are sweet gentle people.  You have to blame the Islamic terrorist for the hatred  you are feeling.  Most Americans don't understand Islam.  Sone think that Islam is responsible for these terror attacks.  It's just ignorance.  I hope that you don't think that all Christians are bad.  I don't think you really do.  We are all human beings.  Some are more closed minded than others.  This is part of life.

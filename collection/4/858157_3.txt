I've seen studies that revealed men were more aroused by visual stimulus than woman. For a man, the entire sexual encounter starts with what he sees and how it affects his hormones, the more explicit things he sees the more excited he gets.Thats why I always recommend that couples have sex w/ the lights on, so the man can be at his best simply by seeing the sexiness of his woman.

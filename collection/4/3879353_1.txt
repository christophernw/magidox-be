Traditionally, books first appeared in hardcover versions. They are easy to make, and can sell for enough to cover the costs of printing rather small runs.. . Once the title sold decently, the publisher would create a smaller 'paperback' version that could be bulk printed. It cost a lot ot set up the machinery, but if they sold the copies cheap, and sold enough of them, they could pay off the set-up costs and make a profit more quickly. It was a risk- if it did not sell, they lost money, so they only used to do it if the hardcover sold well, or it was a type of book that was a safe bet.. . Thus, the paperback edition is a cheaper version of the 'good' thing.

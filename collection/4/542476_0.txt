thrust has to do with the speed of the aircraft,creating enough speed to achieve lift.The wing gets lift by air traveling faster under the wing than on top of it.Drag is used to stabilize the aircraft(ailerons etc.)gravity is what happens when you slow down the aircraft,creating less lift(air under the wings)

Simply ask or you will never know. But I think that their sexual preference may not be any of your business. That's just not nice to ask. You can generally tell, I can tell but I guess some people can't. Ask a friend of yours if they have thought the same thing. Just don't be judgemental towards them for the way they live their life. It's choice and you have lots of rights and they have the same.

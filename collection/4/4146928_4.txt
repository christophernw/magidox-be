I think you mean a 'Prima Donna' lol. I'm not exactly sure of the literal translation, but it's an expression used to describe a person who is vain, prissy and very demanding of everybody attention! This person needs all the people around them, not only to give them all the attention, ALL the time, but also expects everyone to do what they say and give them anything they want.. Famous Prima Donna's:. Shannon Dogherty.. Almost ALL supermodels.

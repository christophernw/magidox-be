omfg not one person can tell u crap let me try. first of all all small block chevys ie 283 302 305 327 350 400 all look alike as they are the same cast. so here is what u do go to the passenger side by the firewall where the block bolts to the tranny bell housing there will be a string of numbers clean them off and search them they will tell u what it is. PASSENGER SIDE BY FIREWALL RIGHT BEHIND THE HEAD WHERE TRANNY BOLTS TO BLOCK CLEAN AND CHECK FOR NUMBERS DO SAME ON OTHER SIDE.

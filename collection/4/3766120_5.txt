it is christian faith that confessing your sins before christ and repenting is the first step to salvation- and it isnt true that only catholics confess. catholics have a 'one-to-one' confession between the person and the priest while most others have a mass confession where the mass confess that they have sinned by repeating a confessional prayer after the priest.

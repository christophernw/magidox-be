in tidal areas it is just the tise coming in. but in fresh water its different. water coming down hill can gather enough energy to push it uphill(bit like a rollercoaster) for a few miles.  also the river tyne in runs up hill its entire length due to water being sucked  by megavacuum forces created by high-level eparoration at the source.

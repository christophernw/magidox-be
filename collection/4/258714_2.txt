Two ways:  use a chemistry lab and blow the fibers in gas phase utilizing carbon fiber cationic polymerization.  OR you can buy a separated version for the end-consumer, where you just spray it out of a can, and the monomers and solvent unmix as you spray it.  The solvent actually vaporizes and the cationic polymerization occurs (much like superglue).

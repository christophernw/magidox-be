Whenever people get tired after eating it is because their metabolism is either working overtime trying to digest a large meal or they've gone long periods without eating. I would recommend eating smaller meals spread throughout your day. Instead of 3 large meals, such as breakfast, lunch and dinner, you may consider a schedule of 5-6 smaller meals spread out evenly. The point is you want to regulate your metabolism so that it is steady and not climbing any peaks or taking any nosedives. If there is ever a point when you actually feel a sensation of hunger, then you have waited too long since your last meal.

What are your symptoms?. . I recently discovered yeast and or wheat caused mine.  When I skip wheat and yeast products I feel much better.  Its hard to do but it comes back everytime I eat a wheat crackers bread etc. Apparently allergies can change with age since until the last 5 to 8 years I never had this problem.

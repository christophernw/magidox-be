Yes,the Ethiopians really do have the Ark of the Covenant.I saw something about it being in their possession a few years ago on the Discovery Channel & read something about it in National Geographic magazine.. . As to why the Vatican doesn't have it,what I read about it & what I watched on TV about it,that wasn't even addressed.My guess is that they weren't sure about its existence,since,up until a few years ago,many people(mainly archaelogists),didn't believe that it still existed after 586 B.C.

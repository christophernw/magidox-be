Being gay is a sin because the Gods word tells us that it is...  We are not suppose to be with others that are the same sex as we are.... God does not accept it and society does not accept it.... It will never be accepted, I have a friend two actually that are gay, one is male and the other is female... The male friend thinks that he was born to be gay.... Although he acknowledges that the Bible plainly goes against it along with society, and has said that he wishes that he could find a female that he would consider sleeping with so that maybe he could change.... So if he believes that he was born that way why would he want to change? Because deep down he knows that it is not right.... If you seek you will find, and once you ask for forgiveness and actually put fourth the effort to turn your life over and leave your old ways in his hands then he will allow you a new mind.... He will change your ways of thinking... No sin shall enter in and regardless of who thinks that it is wrong or right, God above all tells us it is wrong it is a sin, and no sin shall enter into the kingdom of heaven...

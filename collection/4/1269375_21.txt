Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. ??. . Well, I believe Paul is talking to a small group of people in Thessalonia who would have written to him about certain concerns and questions regarding Paul's teachings - and he is answering them. I'm sorry, but Paul is not talking to you.. . Usually he is trying to encourage them to not go back under the law and old traditions, since he has taught them of grace and peace. The other apostles were very good at instilling fear into people about the law. Paul did not agree with them at all.  (Galations, Acts)  Gospel means good news. . . Sin and hell fire is not good news. Saved by the grace of Jesus and not your own good works is good news.

One thing I would like to clear up about the civil war is that it was NOT about slavery.  It was about state's individual rights.  When Lincoln freed the slaves in the South, he kept his slaves.  The president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, didn't even believe in most of the agreements made by the South but he did believe in their right to run there states how they choose.  By the way, many slaves fought on the side of the Confederacy.  Don't get me wrong, the right side won and I in no way agree with slavery.  I just think more schools should teach the real issue behind the war.

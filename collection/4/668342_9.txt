When I am healthy, I work out everyday.  I work my upper body on one day and I work my lower body on an alternating day.. . Unless you are ill and your physician advised you to take it easy, I see no reason that you could not exercise daily in moderation.. . Even when I do not feel healthy, I  do stretching, Yoga ,Tai Chi(TaiJi) or Pa Kua (BaGua) or any number of other more gentle exercises.

Prejudice and sterotyping can be a strong tendency for anyone anywhere. Just as many people from other countries dislike Americans just because they are Americans, it's possible that there are those who look at Arabians the same way. HOWEVER, not all or even I dare say most American people have a hatred towards the Arabian people. Most people recognize that a small extreemist group does not represent everyone. . So basicly, No. Americans do not hate Arabians.

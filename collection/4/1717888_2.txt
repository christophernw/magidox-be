The "international" appellation of the chain derives from its three core crepe-style pancakes: "German" (served with lemon butter), "French" (served with orange sauce), and "Swedish" (served with lingonberries and lingonberry butter). These fruit-topped crepes are offered with an egg-and-meat plate as the "International Passport Breakfast." Menu offerings such as French toast and Belgian waffles further reinforce the international theme.

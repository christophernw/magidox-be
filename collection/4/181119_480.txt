During my high school years, every summer was spent working with a local construction company.  I hated it with a passion.  The hours sucked... carrying the cement suckes... wiring sucked... plumbing sucked.... . However, now when something goes wrong with my house.  I know how to fix it.  I don't have spend $50 / hr for a heating technician or pay some overweight plubmer to replace the fixtures under my sink.  I can do it myself... thanks to that summer job that to this day, I still hate.

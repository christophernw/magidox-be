Sometimes teachers have to punish the whole class.  Sometimes there's no way to know who's guilty and who isn't so in order to discourage a behavior the teacher is forced to punish everyone.  I know it sucks, but it's the way of the world. . . Try talking to the teacher.  Tell them that you are good and you don't understand why you get punished with the bad kids.  . . If you aren't willing to do that, then there's a good chance you aren't as good as you claim to be.

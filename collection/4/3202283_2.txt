Just as a correction note, if you want to take a bus to Guaruja from Sao Paulo, you have to go to Jabaquara Bus Terminal, not Tiete. Guaruja is a nice city, good beaches and very good reputation among the middle class population who flocks the city during summer time and long weekends. Regarding safety issues, you should be cautious like anywhere else.

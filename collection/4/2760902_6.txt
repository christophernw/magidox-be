Concur with the above ... the Egyptians never left recordings and their hieroglyphs are pretty unhelpful. When I was in Egypt, the tour guides all pronounced it Bast (rhymes with last), or Bastet. But they were modern Egyptians, who are Arabic speakers.. It could be Bost, Baist, Best, Bust, Boost, Bist or anything else. We don't really know.. I must say that, to an English-tuned ear. Bast sounds best.. Cheers.

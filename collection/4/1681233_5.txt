I have dealt with this and managed it for a long time. Drink a lot of water - that is number 1. I drink 4-5 24oz bottles per day.  Cut down on sugars - I basically eliminated pop and syrup, etc from food I eat.  Get a little sun.  Use an astringent cleanser and some oxy 10 once a day or so (less if in the sun).  . DO NOT APPLY COCOA BUTTER - that is the biggest pore clogging acne causing ingredient there is.  Do not use anything in fact that doesn't at least claim to not cause acne.  . This is advice for those prone to acne.  It is irrelevant if you do not already have acne because that would indicate you have a different skin type.

Contrary to popular belief,there are far more ways to become obese then just overconsumption of calories and lack of exercise.Edocrine malfunction such as thyroid impairment,hormonal imbalances,and hyperinsulima can lead to obesity,even if the person does not over eat!A metabolic diet after yo yo dieting can cause the person to gain back the weight plus more,as it requires less and less calories to maintain the metabolism.THE FACT IS,ITS NOT JUST CAUSED BY OVEREATING AND LACK OF EXERCISE,AND THE STEROTYPE THAT ALL OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE BINDGE AND REFUSE TO MOVE MUST GO!!!!

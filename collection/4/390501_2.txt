Great question !!. I'm a health care provider and my only "guess" is that it is so routine to cleanse the skin first that the person administering the drugs is just doing it "like they always do".  You are correct that it is a needless practice in these cases...perhaps the observing family is being respected as someone in the audience may be a health professional.

Because a woman should be able to make up her own mind about what she does and does not do with her body.  Some people say its taking a life.  Others say it isn't.  I think if you're against abortion you shouldn't have one.  . . I think it's okay to tell people you're against abortion.  I don't think it's okay to try and stop them or legislate against them.  There should be fewer of them....but in the end it's all up to the woman.

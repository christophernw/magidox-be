The abortion in itself is not a comfortable procedure... and the rehabilitation (mental and physical) is not always easy, either. I've never had an abortion myself, but I know two women who have... one had pretty much no mental issues afterward, but her body couldn't cope, and the other had no physical issues afterward, but she was riddled with guilt. It all really depends upon the woman. When you go in for the abortion, they give you a bunch of info about what to expect, and they offer you time with a psychologist as well.

It's a little complicated but basically the expected or average life span of a species is a consequence of natural selection. The arguments and evidence for this are actually quite interesting. The briefest summary of the arguments follows:. . There are basically two processes that contribute to this process. First, as we get older, we are less and less important from a fitness standpoint. Since natural selection favors any trait that causes the production of more offspring, selection is naturally less strong on traits that show up later in life, because you are more likely to be dead (because of accidental mortality) and not producing offspring. Basically, you are less likely to be producing offspring later in life, so any traits that cause you to fall apart later in life aren't selected against very strongly. A dramatic example is Huntington's chorea a genetic disease that only manifests after the age of 40. It's not selected out because of its limited effect on reproduction - now just think of hundreds of genes with smaller effects that huntingtons and you have senescence. . . Second: early reproduction is more important that later reproduction in a growing population. This is exactly analogous to early investment in a growing stock market being better than later investment because of compounded interest. What this means is that if a gene arises that causes higher reproduction early in life *and* lower reproduction later in life (i.e. illness or death) then it will always be selected for. As these accumulate, selection pushes reproduction as early as possible in life and limits the life span. . . Here are some links to other descriptions.

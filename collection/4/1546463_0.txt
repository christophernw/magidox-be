Well....open space doesnt have anything for the sunshine to fall upon, therefore it just passes through. If you were there, say in a spacecraft, there would, indeed, be "daylight." It would fall upon you and your craft anytime you were not blocked from the sun by a planet. So, "day" and "night" wouldn't be relevent, but you get the idea.

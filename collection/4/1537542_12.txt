The best way is to go to the pet store and purchase something called Nature's Remedy...something like that...it has enzymes that break down the urine and truly eliminates the smell...works the best...but if your cat or cats are urinating out of the litter box, you should definitely take them to the vet because they may have a urinary tract infection that needs meds.  Cats only urinate out of the box when either they're ill or if the litter hasn't been changed often enough...

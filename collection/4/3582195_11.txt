the ACLU is the American Civil Liberties Union so I don't know what they're doing in England. some Muslim clerics teach what you've written, but certainly not all. you need to inform yourself about what the Muslim religion is and is not; read the Koran, read a few histories of the Muslim peoples (many and varied). non-Muslims do not support these types of statements, just that everyone has the right to say what they want, even if it is stupid or ill-informed. provided it is not incendiary(inviting people to violate the law) or grossly impinging on the rights of others to their own freedoms, then people should be encouraged to say what they think; at least then we know.

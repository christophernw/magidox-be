My advice don't tell her until you leave home.  She might kick you out or do something drastic.  I had a friend that told her Neo Con mom that she was Pagan and her mom shipped her away to one of those Jesus camps until she admitted that the devil had taken her soul over. Of course, she was lying, but she said they started giving her less and less food everyday until she repented.

I was cussed out for recommending a fellow get his watch dog from a shelter. He wanted a dog to protect his family while he was away, and I said a grown dog from the shelter would be a better guardian than a new puppy.....Well, he emailed me with considerable cussing!. However, I still allow contact link, as I like to be of help when I can.

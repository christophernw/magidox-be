The US Constitution does not mention marriages one way or the other. However certain people are concerned about using the equal protection clause to say that if women can marry men, so can men. Others may be concerned that the full faith and credit clause in Article 4 may be used to force gay marriages performed in one state where it's legal to be recognized in another where it's not.

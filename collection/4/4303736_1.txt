It has indeed something to do with Spain. The bull symbolizes the supression of the Catalans. Originally it was just a symbol for Osborne Sherry, but somehow it developed a deeper meaning. Many cars in Spain have the bull next to their licence plate instead of the country identification sticker (which is obligatory in all of Europe, I guess). . For the Catalans, the bull symbolizes old centralistic Spain. It's a kind of agressive gesture, because the Catalans want autonomy from the rest of Spain.

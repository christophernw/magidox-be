i don't know much about college applications(im only in jh!!!) but i do know that you don't neccesarily have to know everything to get in, all you have to know is how to write well and use a good vocab.  email me and tell my what you want to include in your app and ill help you figure out how to write it.  as for a cv, i dunno what that is.

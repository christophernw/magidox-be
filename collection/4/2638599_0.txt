One good analogy is to view the daily blood sample tests you give yourself as a snapshot, while the HbA1c test is more like a movie.  I'm Type 2, and I was able to drop mine from about 11% (ouch) to a more normal 6.5%.  It took almost a year, and it required a more sensible diet and constant monitoring and refining of a series of medication.

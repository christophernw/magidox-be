It deals with geometry in that you have to set up proper angles and predict where the ball should end using multiple angles. It also deals with physics in that you have ot control how hard you calculate your shot in order to end in a specific location, as well as things like friction coefficients, ball speed, ball rotation and spin, energy transfer, energy loss, and other aspects that you normaly dont think about when playing  a rack in your local bar.

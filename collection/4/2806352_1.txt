in short, without money for research we wouldn't even have chemotherapy and radiation treatments right now as well as biotherapy ( which is the newest treatment) unfortunataly not every one can be saved. the stage of the cancer when it is discovered, the form of cancer (as some like oat cell carcinoma spread very fast) and the persons overall state of health before the cancer are very important factors in treatment.

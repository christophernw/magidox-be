Honestly, nothing is "safe" everything has down points to it. You have to be very cautious when doing anything. Look at the bottom of the web page quite a few people are certified with the Better Business Bureau, and some are anti-identity theft awarded. I would check at them bottom of the pages, click on it and make sure it takes you to the exact site. Never be to careful. If you can call the company and make sure that the number is correct and that the place sounds legit. Many scam companies don't like to be asked multiple security questions, if someone gets frustrated with you and gives you general answers don't deal with them.

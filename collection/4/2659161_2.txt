First of all, what do you mean by "psychological problems"? In my opinion, we all have them to a different degree. Another philosophical question is, what is the norm? Psychiatrists have their criteria for diagnosing really sick people - we, laymen, sometimes can have no clue about someone's condition.. When you are in a close relationship with someone, you will definitely notice "psychological problems" in that person, for, on the one hand, no one can be perfect for you, in the family, in friendship or in the intimate relationship, on the other hand, as I already said, you are not perfect either. And from this perspective to have psychological problems is a norm.

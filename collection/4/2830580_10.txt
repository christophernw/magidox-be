make a joke of your reply are you seeing some one yes I'm looking at you... close to getting married? Sure I live close to a married couple.... It's a way of saying mind your own business without being rude.  Just make sure your charming as you answer and they will get the point.  Follow up your reply with changing the subject or else they will start talking about their own personal life and expect you to reciprocate with an answer about yours.  If they don't get the point and keep asking then etiquette is out the door and you can be rude because it is rude to keep asking.

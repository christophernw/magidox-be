Try sleeping for a few hours and then get up at say 1AM.. You'll find once you get into a routine, you'll get used to it.. Strong coffee also helps for some people (never worked for me).. If you can't stay up to get your assignments and such done, you have a tough time in college. Get that sorted out now. It's mind over matter. Like Young Jeezy says (I can sleep when I die). Seriously, you'll have plenty of time to sleep after college.

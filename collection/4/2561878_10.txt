A lot of stores are cutting down on bagger to save money.  There usually some lurking around somewhere, though.  I'm handicapped, so someone always bags mine.  Try going there with a cane or a crutch, though it might just be easier just to suck it up and bag your own groceries.  It's not that difficult!

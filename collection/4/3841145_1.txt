Volvo built a 2 seater sports car called the P1800 from the early 1960's through the mid 1970's.  It was built as a fast-back coupe or a square-back called the P1800ES. Quite a few of these were imported to the USA.  You can find more info on these at www.volvop1800club.se. . There were several "hot Rod" Volvos in the late 70's and early 80's, including the 262C coupe, with body designed by Bertone of Italy.  The 242 Turbo and 242 GT were also big on performance, but all these were 2+2 cars with a full sized rear seat.. . I don't recall any other 2-seater Volvos.

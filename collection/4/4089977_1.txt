Just an idea - since your dad doesn't like dogs, and I'm guessing that your parents are seperated and/or divorced?. then why don't you move in with your mom so you can be close to your dog?  You can visit your dad just like you visited your mom and you could have your dog with you as you want without putting your dad through changes.. . Good Luck!

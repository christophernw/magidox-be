How about instead of all the reading writing and arithmetic, they actually helped kids how to understand that people are good and all people should be treated with resepct and helping them understand that crime, violence and all the bad things in life is unacceptable.. How about we teach young kids they will be old one day too and should be patient with them. . How about teaching people to be able to smile and show them the world is about all the things above..

You pay enough there for everything to be good. from the juices from the steak to your glass of water- everything was tasty and well worth the dollar. They of course have good chefs so everything is meant to taste good - drunk or not.. . if i were you i would just call and ask what's in it- if they say they will not tell - just say your spouse seems to got a food allergie and in order for the doctors to treat it they gotta know all the ingridients in the last meal- ( this has worked for me before) esp. when i try to make the same things at home

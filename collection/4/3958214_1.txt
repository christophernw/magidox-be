Absorption of infrared radiation causes a temperature increase in the surface of the item in question.  The heating effect is usually uneven and spreads from the side facing the source of infrared radiation to the opposite side.  Some materials absorb IR more readily than others, hence the so-called "greenhouse effect".  The glass of the greenhouse absorbs little of the IR directed at it but the interior heats quite effectively in full sunlight.  Hope that helps.

Ugh!  Nothing worse than wallpaper paste dumplings!. . I always use Bisquick and follow their directions for dumplings.  They come out light and fluffly.. . The secret to dumplings is that you put them ON TOP of whatever you are cooking and cover them so that they are steamed NOT in the liquid to be boiled.

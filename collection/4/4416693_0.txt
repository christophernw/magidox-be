The Word of God is clear that the power to heal or cast out devils comes only from almighty God and the laying on of hands is merely an obedience to the instructions of God's word .. I have observed miriculous healings by this means but it is required that the person or persons laying on of hands understands that they must be free of sin in their life and must be in complience with the wor dof God for the Lord to honor their actions.

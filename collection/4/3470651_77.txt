WOW i have the same problem... Everytime i leave my desk at work, Everything i touch shocks me! A few days ago, my boyfriend kissed me and it socked his lips! I cant get rid of it either! but it has too do with the dryness in the air because i've noticed that when it rains, I never get shocked... And it has absolutely NOTHING to do with your car, since your car is made of metal, it is also a suspect! LOL

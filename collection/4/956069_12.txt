I hope your not joking about mental illness-. Call your insurance provider, they HAVE to find you someone who is accepting patents.  I went through this with a for a specialist........ . Go to the hospital if you need immediate assistance.. Infact if you tell your insurance you will have to go to the hospital if they can't find you someone, they will find someone for you faster.

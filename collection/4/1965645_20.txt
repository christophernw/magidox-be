I actually read on article in NEw York times on  a silmilar article. It is just happens that most poor people in America are black and are overweight from poor diet. McDonald's for example targets people in poor neighborhood, specifically blacks and latinos with targeted advertisements becaus ethey make up most of their costumers. I blame evil corporations and poverty. I am sure a lot of poor white people in poor southern states are also overweight.

BitterMelon if such was available.... . I would say Bittermelon because.... . 1)  Life is never prefectly fair. 2)  Some get a sweet tingy taste, just like life, the feeling is somewhat sweet but bitter in the heart. 3)  Life is always like a Bittermelon ice-cream because this taste is special since not a lot is known too, just like life, only a few of us are famous. . . www.diamondgemztone.piczo.com. <>dia gemz. sheri

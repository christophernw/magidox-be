You would be surprised at how much losing some weight will give you a more defined jaw.  I used to think I just had a jaw that wouldn't be pronounced, but after losing about 20 lbs I can definitely see it - in fact, I notice it everyday because I like how it looks.  I'm sorry I can't help you about surgery; I just wanted to tell you my experience.  Jaws aren't really good to mess with though, reconstructive surgery I've heard can be really painful.

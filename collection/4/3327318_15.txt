Great speech,, I totally agree,,, I think these gay freaks are finally at a point in life that they can openly come out of the closet,, but its a shame because maybe being gay isn't there choice but it is not "normal",... if it was normal then god would have made us all the same sex and life could not continue on if everyone was gay... so get a grip homo's and no its not normal and it is immoral!!

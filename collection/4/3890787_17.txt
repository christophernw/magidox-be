blindguardian is suggesting warp theory, and it is just a theory.. . Your question has no answer because it does not state all the possible parameters.  It does not allow for an absolute vaccuum, for instance, or objects that may interfere with the transit.  Only when every variable is known can the shortest route be computed.  Otherwise, it's a guess.

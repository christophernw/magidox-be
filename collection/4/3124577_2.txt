Bocoo doesn't know what he's talking about.  Soy milk is a very poor substitute for skim (nonfat) milk.  First of all, soy protein is a far lower quality protein than whey (dairy) protein.  Whey protein (in milk) is a complete protein that has the essential amino acids that your body requires to build and sustain a lean and healthy physique.  And, unlike soy protein, whey protein is metabolized much more easily into muscle tissue.  Finally, whey protein also does a better job of controlling your appetite.. . Milk has other benefits too, such as more calcium, vitamin A & D fortification, and less sugar than sweetened soy milk.  A glass of skim milk is only 90 calories (most of which comes from the protein).. . So, unless you're lactose intolerant, don't substitute soy milk for skim milk.  You're not doing your body any good.. . By the way, there is no estrogen in soy milk.  Kabbob is obviously just joking around.

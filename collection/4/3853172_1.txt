The body's systems don't renew the cells. And you cant make a distroyed cell alive again unless you have magical powers. Dead is Dead. But the body will produce new fresh cells ( like red blood cells) every few weeks. And some your born will a numbered amount and thats it. Like ovum.. (the eggs in females)

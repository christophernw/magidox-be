I believe what you mean is isolating a magnetic monopole, not a magnetic pole.. . A magnetic monopole is a theoretical subatomic particle predicted by at least one Grand Unified Theory (usually SuperString theories). At this point, detection is much more important that isolating. Detecting one would go a long way to supporting some of the SuperString theories.

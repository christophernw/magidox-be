It has broad appeal in the fact that is is a really good thriller.  It's subversive and controversial in that it takes a negative look at organized religion, Roman Catholicism in particular.  It does an excellent job creating a credible plot out of modern Holy Grail theory.  None of the stuff was groundbreaking, but would be eye-opening if you weren't up on it and thought it was interesting.  Also it intertwines puzzles for the readers to try and solve as they are being solved in the text (or in the movie).

women:love light colors love to stay clean love the arts and sensitive. men:the total opposite. woman:they're bodies are different. they're breast hurt sometime they get periods go through puberty before boys. men:the don't really change but get taller and bigger in some areas :). so men don't understand the things women go through. and women are more mature i would say and kinda smarter  not in school i mean in life. in school guys kick girls a s s but thats just what i think. neither understands what the other sex goes through

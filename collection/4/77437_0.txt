The herpes virus can't live on it's own outside the human body for long, however... when you have an outbreak, you shouldn't share towels with anyone. It can live on a moist towel for a while after use. I have heard that it's not possible to spread it through a toilet seat, etc. You should practice very good hygeine however. Wash your hands after if you need to scratch. every time!! You can infect yourself further by touching your sores then touching your mouth!! 80% infection rate!!!! Wash your hands everytime with soap and hot water. Even when your sores are gone, you shed the virus at certain times with no symptoms. Always, always wash after touching or going to the bathroom, you have to consider yourself infective at all times even with no symptoms.

It's a cultural difference. Different cultures are brought up to believe different things. Then closed minded people differ in their opinions about something and fight about it instead of respecting others'.. . That's were racism comes along. Parents telling their children BS about the other races and the children are either too young or too stupid to make up their own opinions. Sometimes it's just so ingrained into our heads that after generations it's difficult to think otherwise. It's shameful.

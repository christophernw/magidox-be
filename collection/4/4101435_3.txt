Short answer is, some folks, out of necessity or desire, grow up faster than others.  It's good that you've seen fit to be mature so quickly, but the truth is, a lot of folks are still keen on, if not entirely obsessed with, their childhood and teenage toys..... . And I'm saying this as someone who still remembers his old Atari 2600 and Intellivision primitive video games a bit too fondly.  :p

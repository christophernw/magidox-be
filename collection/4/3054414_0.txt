From what I understand, speech comes from a different area of the brain from that which handles thinking and eye-hand coordination.. . I always think better on paper.  It is not a problem, it is just the way we are.  I went to an organization like Toastmasters to learn how to public speak in all situations.  There are books on how to make acceptable conversation in various situations.  It involves thinking in advance, and practice.  . . With practice, you may feel more comfortable speaking the words that you have no problem writing.

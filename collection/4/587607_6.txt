I think the SAD day was when Bush was elected to office....also were you there on 9/11 which was only 8 months into the inception of Bush's term as our President....were you also there when our national budget was at a surplus at the end of Clinton's term...You definitely must have been there when that budget took a quick dive in the opposite direction in the first few months after Bush was elected....so you were saying.... ?

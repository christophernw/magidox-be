The definition from the source below is absolutely correct.  To put it in "plain English"  chemoautotrophs are organism (life-forms) usually made of only one cell, that can create their own "food" (for lack of a better word) from inorganic material around them, without using sunlight.  Many of the single-cell creatures living near underwater volcanoes are examples - they make everything a cell needs to survive out of the chemicals coming out of the volcano.  They don't use photosynthesis (like plants) or digest other animals or decaying material.

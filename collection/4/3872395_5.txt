Tire them out.  Play races, kickball, ect.. if it is nice out.  If it isn't nice out then color, play hide and go seek, or read them stories.  If none of this works as the parents what they do and if it is okay if they stay awake past the bedtime.  Never give a child liquoir or medication, just to get them to sleep.

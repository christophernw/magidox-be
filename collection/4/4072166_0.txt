Fluorescent tube light gives out light when fluorescent material coated inside the tube is energized by electrons flowing from one electrode to the other.. FTL basically has a starter, and a ballast. Starter is used to develop high voltage across the tube to initiate current flow. The ballast limits the current.. There are starter less FTL where the required potential gradient is achieved by a ground strip, this potential gradient initiates the ionization in the tube, which helps the current to flow.

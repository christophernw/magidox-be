The double paw is most likely a genetic fluke.  It happens when a gene mutates, and the developing embryo gets a new set of directions, which could be anything from polka dots to longer ears and blue eyes.. . Over time in a smaller population, the genetic mutation becomes a common expression of genes.. . Personally, I worry this means that one day cats will develop opposable thumbs.  I fear this means cats will be able to use the can opener on their own and will have no more need for human companionship.

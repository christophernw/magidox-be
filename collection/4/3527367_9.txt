The Jewish people are God's Chosen People, they were drawn out of the gentiles (us) to point the way for the Messiah to come.. When Adam committed the original sin and the garden fell, all of creation fell with us.  The "keys to earth," so to speak, were given to Satan.  Satan controls this world and he hates the Jews.  Therefore, he and his minions whisper in everyone's ears and try to get them to hate the Jews as well.. Read the book of Romans, especially chapters 11 an 12 to get a good insight into the Jewish people.  As Christians, we are "grafted onto the tree" of the Jewish people.  Jesus's sacrifice on the cross allows us to become one of God's Chosen.

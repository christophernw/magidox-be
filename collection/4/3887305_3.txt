Glues or adhesives tend to work in one of three basic ways: . . Some work by “drying” out (in fact the solvent evaporates, concentrating the chemicals). . Some work by reacting chemically with the air (oxidation) to change the chemicals into adhesives. . Then there are other types you may have used which need mixing in two parts (each part alone won’t set). . I am guessing that you are asking about the first two types. When they’re inside the tube the solvent can’t evaporate, nor can the air get to the chemicals, so until they come out, they won’t stick!

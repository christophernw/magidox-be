I got a question, why do people have to ask negative ineffectual, inflammatory questions; and then expect others to supply an answer. Everyone has bad days, some more then others (see above question: Why do christians.....?) It seems that christians get the bad rap for not being tolerant. That being the case, riddle me this!. . Why is it, that when a pro-life or some with now fringe views gets up to speak, they are shouted down and its called freedom of speech. But when a pro-choice or someone with mainstream views gets shouted down, its called intolerance.  . . things that make you go Hmmmm?

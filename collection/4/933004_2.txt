This is the travel category, if people don't inquire much about visit Sudan, there is no demand for it and thus, Yahoo doesn't have to add it.  Should there be an increased number of Sudan travel related questions in the General-Africa & Middle East section, I'm sure Yahoo will put Soudan on the list.  Nothing against the country in particular.

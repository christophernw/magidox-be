Because people's hands cry. Seriously, though are your palms sweaty constantly?  Palm sweat is like your armpits, underside of your feet, forehead, back of your legs and intimate areas especially when you exercise, are nervous or are afraid. Sweating is a very natural process to cool down the blood when you are hot.  Surgery isn't really necessary, didn't your doctor explain why your palms sweat???

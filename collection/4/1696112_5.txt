I don't know how to but someone did asked me out. the way she asked me out was so original that i didn't know she was asking me out(or was i dumb??). We were talking about this Chinese food and she popped the question ... she told me there is a Chinese hangout nearby and asked me if i wanna come. I said yes- never thought it was a date when she took me out somewhere else. The said  hangout was nearer from my house than hers...so u never know. we had fun- the fact that it didn't work our is another matter.. office romance isn't that cool...

i managed to quit every now and then, you just need your willpower, i never tried nicotine chewing gum or patches. You'd better try it when you're not under stress, for example i smoke less (a lot less) now that i'm on holiday (since the school end i've been smoking one or two cigarettes a day vs the half a 20 cigarettes-packet i used to smoke), and i think that soon i'll quit smoking during the day, to smoke only when i go out at night. Moreover: 1-the less you smoke the less you want to 2-avoid the circumstances (when i'm under stress i almost chain smoke, but when i'm relaxed i smoke only when i'm with other smokers or with friends).Good luck!

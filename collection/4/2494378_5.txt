the best destination in the Caribbean to visit will without a doubt be the twin islands of Trinidad and Tobago. its the only twin islands you could find in the world and yet they are very differet from each other. Trinidad has the only pitch lake in the world, and is filled with flora and founa life. however if you are looking to enjoy you days on the beach, going to waterfalls, or just relax, then Tobago is the sister isle for you. you see Tobago won the island for best beaches in the year of 2005. these twin islands has a touch of all the other Caribbean islands. so come visit my home land of Trinidad & Tobago, two islands for the price of one.

Health professional claim that it is the most important meal of the day, it is that added boost to get you started as long as it don't includes a lot of fat,sugar and sodium. plus you have a additional start to burn calories. as for skipping dinner, i just read that the final meal of the day should be consumed before 6:00pm, to give your digestive tract time to digest it before going to bed.

Runners World magazine has had several articles over the years on the benefits of caffeine.  Basically, the article has said the caffeine (but not too much of it) can increase mental and physical performance.  They do, however, recommend that if you drink soda before you run that you leave the can or bottle open for a while to get ride of the carbonation.

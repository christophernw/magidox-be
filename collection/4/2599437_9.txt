I am doing it through diet, because my diabetes is partially due (in my own estimation) by my systemic yeast condition.. . If I get the yeast condition under control, I think it will bring my diabetes under control too.  . . Check out the "yeast" link at www.hufa.org if you are curious about this condition and how it relates to blood sugar imbalances.

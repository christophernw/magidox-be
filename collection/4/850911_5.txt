People say God bless you if someone sneeze because sneezing is a sign or symptom or indication that someone will have an illness such as influenza or a fever,We say God bless you as a pray that may God avoids you from such illness.If we are ill ,we consult to a doctor and eat medicine but in reality only God will healing us.The docror and medicine are only the mediator and its tool.The  omni healer is our God Almighty ,Allah the only one God.If Allah does not bless us and  does not permit us to be healthy we can consult to many doctors and eat various medicines but its sickness is still with us.

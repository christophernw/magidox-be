I went thru similar pain when my brother died of an accident. He was not only my hero but a such a good guy always with a smile and a helping hand. was quite well to do too. We are Buddhits, but the pain and suffering is the same. May I suggest the books "Many Mansions", Edgar Cayce. The Sleeping Prophet". These will at least point to a different perspective of the problem of sickness and death.

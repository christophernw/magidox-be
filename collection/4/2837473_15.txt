Eating grass and leaves won't hurt your dog, but if he is destroying your lawn, you can purchase a product called "Bitter Apple" at any Petco or Petsmart, it comes in a green and white plastic bottle with a sprayer on top, pretty cheap, maybe $4-5, and has a very bitter taste that dogs don't like, spray it on your lawn and or flowers, there are no toxins or anything that will hurt your grass or plants because it is all-natural.  You will probably have to respray every month or so and after rainy days.   . . -Former Petco Employee

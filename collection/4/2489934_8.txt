Technically there is no "cold".  There is only heat, or energy of particles in a piece of matter, OR the absence of heat.  Your refrigerator removes heat from the atmosphere inside it.  The heat energy of the items inside radiates off them into the cooler region which then has the heat removed by the refrigeration process etc.  . So, I would have to say Heat has more "force" since heat is a form of energy.. But, like a previous answerer stated, the strongest of the four forces in nature [1. strong nuclear force 2. weak nuclear force 3. electromagnetism 4. gravity] is the strong nuclear force.  The weakest of the four forces is gravity.

Perhaps your friend is worried about losing you.  I'm not a huge believer in dreams having significant meaning, but to research dream meanings visit the link below.. . On that website, the dream perhaps indicates: "Death . . To dream about the death of a loved one, suggests that you are lacking a certain aspect or quality that the loved one embodies. Ask yourself what makes this person special or what do you like about him. It is that very quality that you are lacking in your own relationship or circumstances. Alternatively, it indicates that whatever that person represents has no part in your own life."

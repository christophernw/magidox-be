As soon as I read your question I had a thought that it could be (generalized question gets a generalized answer) for a number of reasons,. . No impact on current issues, when does a 18-35 have to worry about Social Security or medicare, medicaid prescription drug plan for seniors? I dont think that I have heard one political debate that impacts that age range, other than the common "tax breaks" that effect almost everyone. . . When your 16 and they make laws saying you cant drive and you cant vote its kind of discouraging, when you are 18 and can enlist in the military and die for your country but you cant have a beer people get discouraged.

well, this is really to the injury, I am 42.. i suffer a worse case than being not happy, every night I feel will be my last night, I do not have any disease, but i have some people around me who died ,,and i know, we die early as Egyptians,,I am not afraid to die , I am sorry to die, i spent all these years trying to build something, i built most of what i wanted and forget to build a family, i want to give what i built - and I am not talking about money only-but what I have in mind also .... as i am older, it is more difficult to be impressed by someone,, and I do not have the temper anymore to play the love game,,I am trying to convince myself that  I can live like that,, but I feel deep inside me a huge  pain, being rich is not by money- the same word in my language to indicate a rich woman is also to indicate a woman with a daughter (i am male ) ,,according to that I am  a very poor person.... . It is true that Man is in his best in the 40s....it is true I am very fit ...sporty looking person, but i regret i was not like that 10 years ago.... . They said from 6-20 education from 20-30 culture, from 30-50 working and benefit the education and culture to have financial stability,, starting from 50 u can really enjoy what u did ,,,and relax..perhaps ,,that is true,,But i forgot to invest: In a family

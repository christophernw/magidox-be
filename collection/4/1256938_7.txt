Too many kids have a completely lethargic lifestyle.  They play video games and watch TV, and they don't go outside and play with their friends enough.  They eat too many unhealthy foods i.e. fast food, chips, soda, candy.  Now even in schools they are discouraging/banning a lot of games that require physical activity because someone might get their feeling hurt.

The Bible tells us that all we must do to be saved is to ask Jesus to forgive us of our sins and accept Him as our Savior by believing He is the living Son of God who died on the cross for our sins. You can pray and ask Jesus to forgive you for your sins. Confess the things you have done that are wrong and then just admit your need for Him in your life. There is no right or wrong way to ask. He knows your heart and He hears every word you speak. Please just trust Jesus and He will forgive you of your sins.

poverty, unless you are talking about "the poverty line" which is an economic calculation, is a relative term. Don't compare your purchasing power to others, only look at your absolute living standard ( do you have a warm shelter? healthy food? clean water? even internet?) Remember there are millions of people in other countries living in much lower standards than yourself. In short, just don't think relative and think in absolute terms.

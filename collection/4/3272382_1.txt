My rule of thumb is always approach people as they are good people; however, trust your instincts. If you don't like the way someone looks at you, you don't have to make them your best friend or hang out with them, but you don't have to avoid them. . If you are feeling insecure there are things you can do. Take a self defense class, carry pepper spray, don't walk alone at night, and always be alert when you are alone, not paranoied, just alert. I'm sure there are other things that you can do, those are just the basics.

The media is a huge piece of America, and that includes newspapers and magazines, television, the internet, radio, etc. People will watch a television program or ad which gives a certain slant on a person or topic and then call themselves informed, when television is the most limited in terms of information. Think about it - the average news program is one half hour or hour. Take out the commercials and chit chat and you are down to 20 or 40 minutes respectively. . . Also some media that are partisan and that wish to make a name for themselves by making certain issues "their" issues use the big lie theory - tell a big lie, tell it often enough, and people will start to believe it. (J. Goebbels, Hitler's minister of propaganda, used this tool very well to turn Germans against Jews.) . . Basically most people do not take the time to find out the facts; they're lazy, busy or apathetic. They're also easily manipulated.

"Small" is a relative term here. Caimans are among the smaller species of crocs at 6 to 8' long, but that is still a big animal- bigger than all but a couple species of lizard. . . They are percieved as being 'minature' mostly because we are so used to seeing the babies (which are a LOT cuter than many crocs!) and because we compare them to our alligators, which are a really big species of croc.

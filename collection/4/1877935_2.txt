Good question!. This same question has made separation in Islamic world for centuries.  FYI in this religion there is a "Grand Tree of Life" with a name of each person ever live on earth along with their destiny.  They too believe that death, fortune, your life partner (spouse) and so on is already determined even before you are born.  Seems absolutely predetermined isn't it?  Nevertheless there's a verse in it's book of revelation that says "God will not alter one's fate unless he alter it himself."  It confuses even the religion's most profound thinkers.  . One solution to the paradox is that "God doesn't follow the ordinary concept of time".  Like the one our friend b_steeley and clcalifornia has very beautifully described earlier (but I found this by myself many years a go though).. With this postulate in mind there will be no more paradox.  This also agree with the concept that "God has no end and no beginning".  So yes they are coexist!  But not in the way we human perceive it.

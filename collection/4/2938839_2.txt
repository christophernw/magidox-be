Realize many things about where our feelings come from.  For example, many people who say they hate themselves are actually NOT being humble- because they think they are too good to have problems- they think they are too special to have heartache- they think that God somehow punished them by making them who they are- that means they think they could have done better in their own creation.  It is kinda hard to sum up in so few words, but if you think about it, the point will pop out at ya. ;)

There really isn't a concrete way to tell.  If you're gay, or a fag-hag, you're equipped with a gay-dar.  If this is something you really want to fine-tune your gay-dar, I would suggest visiting a gay-district.  San Diego has Hillcrest, Sydney has Oxford St., San Fransisco has Castro area.  But just be forewarned that not all gay people fit this stereotype.  I'm a backpacker and when I travel I don't shave for days at a time, and I have a beard.  I guess, we all come in different shapes and sizes.  :)

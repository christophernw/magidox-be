Because your clothes stink, your breath stinks, you are throwing away money that could go to things that would be a better reflection of the values you hold. You need more and more cigarettes to recreate the original feeling it gave you, so it's getting more expensive because of quantity and higher taxes. If you are like most smokers I know, you don't even like smoking and aren't sure why you continue.. . Because you are asking this question on here, which tells me you want to quit. Because you pay higher medical bills, or you will with age. Because you don't want to be the person smoking a cigarette through a trach stoma. Because you are tired of funding a big corporate machine that doesn't care if you live or die as long as they get your money.. . Because you need healthy lungs to live. Because you care about your family and friends and don't want to contribute to their health problems through your second hand smoke. Because smoking isn't as cool now as it was when you were sneaking puffs in the backyard behind the shed with your friends. Because you are stronger than a cigarette addiction.

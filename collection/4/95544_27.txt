Well, if you really want to follow Jesus' example, then you should become an agnostic.. . Jesus was a heretic.  He confronted the organized religions of the time, and turned them inside out.  This is why he was persecuted, and eventually killed.  He saw the hypocrisy and brainwashing, and worked to change it, in the only way he knew how.. . If Jesus was alive today, I imagine he would probably do the same thing.  But instead of changing the concept of God, given the evidence, I would think he would instead spread the word of agnosticism and/or atheism.. . (This is with the understanding that Jesus was a philosopher, not a mythological superhero)

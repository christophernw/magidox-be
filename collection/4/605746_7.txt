Who asks a question like this?  This is like an Iraqi saying "Americans drop bombs on us.  Are they showing us how merciless they are?".... . It has nothing to do with toughness.  I walk to work in the rain, but it isn't a statement of toughness - it's a case of "I'm going to work, and it happens to be raining".. . Geez!. . Coulls

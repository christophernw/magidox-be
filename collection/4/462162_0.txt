There are a lot of factors, war, overpopulation, genocide, mismangement, corroption, I'll tell you a story but i'll change the name and the country, it's one example of what causes world hunger. I had a friend who worked with an agency who went to this country to hand disperse food, when they arrived they had to bribe the soldiers and then bribe the local govenment head,  they then had to turn over the food to these people to a "storage" area in which they couldn't get to it for a month when they finally paid another bribe they found that it wasn't they same amount of food that they put in, so they had to take what little food and water to feed 5,000 people,  This political told them that these were not his people and that they should starve.  This is one story of many that she/he told me. Some times these governments are so corrupt and unstable they rather feed thier soldiers and themselves to keep what little they have.

I can't recall anytime that I have seen obituaries in our local paper for anyone who is Muslim, Hindu, Chinese etc. I guess that people from other cultures have readings & prayers at their temples/places of worship for the deceased. Some of the obituries are to announce the death of somebody and some are from people who wish to make a public display of emmotion at the passing of somebody dear to them.. . The newspapers make a fortune out of obituries. It can cost £11 to say Happy Birthday to somebody but it costs £52 to put an obitury in. I can never understand why it costs more for death.

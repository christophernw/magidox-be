Tautomerism is a type of isomerism in Organic Chemistry.It arises due to 1-3 migration of a hydrogen atom from one polyvalent atom to the other within the same molecule.Isomers thus obtained which exist in dynamic equilibrium with each other are called tautomers and the phenomenon is called tautomerism.There are several tautomerism but one known as keto-enol is most popular.You can click the following link to find examples that i hosted on imageshack: . http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/4167/tauto1me.jpg.

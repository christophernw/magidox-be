It's the oldest of republican rhetoric always spouted at election time to try and sway democrats to vote republican. Fact of the matter is; if you are in a lower to middle income tax bracket your taxes will probably not change. Republican tax roll backs were just offset by higher fee's for other government services like your DMV charges for registration and plates. What you may see happen is the tax breaks for the upper class rescinded and measures taken to see that they pay their fair share.

Cats, by nature are nocturnal animals. Therefore they sleep a lot during the day, and at night they are very active. My Siamese tends to use the night to beat up my face, lay on my head, knead my back, claw my hands, put her wet nose in my ear, and suck on my hair. My fat one sleeps all the time. She's just fat.

Dude it doesn't really matter what race people are. I think that your buddy is just more athletic than you. You might be stronger than him but he just has better control and coordination of his limbs that make him run better and faster than you. I have a friend from Cameroon and I'm a faster sprinter than him and he said he used to run to school when he was little before his parents moved to the city.

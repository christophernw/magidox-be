I feel the same way, so I've come to realize that weight gain and loss is a long term average over many years of your lifestyle choices. We know that people confined to concentration camps in World War II for any length of time were not fat, no matter what their body's fat genes were programmed to. They didn't eat much food regardless of how much exercise they got in the work camps. So although different people may burn calories at different rates depending on their age and other factors, the overall dominating equation probably is the balance between the number of calories you eat versus the number of calories you burn up in your daily bodily functions and activities.

You will need to purchase a power inverter that will change 120 volts into 12 volts. These can be purchased at just about any electronics store (Best Buy, Circuit City, Radio Shack, etc.) and are relatively inexpensive. If all you are connecting is a car stereo, a unit with a smaller ampere rating (less than 25 amps) will work just fine. . . These units typically come with a cigarette lighter plug on the face (you can pick up a piece that connects into this and provides you with a 12 volt positive and ground) that will run your radio in your room. If you plan on adding anything additional (amplifier, crossover, TV, etc) to this unit, get one with a much higher ampere rating.

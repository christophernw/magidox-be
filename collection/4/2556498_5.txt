Because they think it's cool or stylish, or because they have a vague idea of who he is, or in a rare case because they know who he is and admire him, and they think all the other people who wear che shirts are boludos. I'm living in Argentina where a lot of people use them and actually know who the guy is. By the way, all this stuff about how he was killing innocent people is likely (I won't claim to have been there) propaganda coming from his enemies at the time... at least that's what people who were there are saying, including some of the indians who weren't on either side.. . As for Castro, Che and Castro are not the same person... as a matter of fact I think the CIA, by killing Che, killed the only person who could have kept Castro from going a little too far.

Tea lovers love tea because each of us has experienced a proper cup.  As an unapologetic tea aficionado (UTA, for short), check the following:.  1.  Good water (filtered and/or spring water).  2.  Good leaves (leaves unfurling releases flavor).  3.  No oversteeping (makes for a bitter brew). . Better yet... click here to check out a nice gourmet tea starter kit http://www.adagio.com/. .

I don’t think it’s only guys..  girls also date people based on their appearance... but when you think about it... what's the first thing you see when you look at someone? What they look like! You can't look at a person and get an outline of all of their qualities and especially not their range of knowledge. It’s just life. But I must say, if you have to continuously try to make yourself noticed by someone, why would you be interested in this person anyway? There are billions and billions of people in the US alone… why stress out over one person that hasn’t noticed you? Just because they are smart and funny and have everything you look for in a person??  I doubt that, that ONE person is the only one with those qualities. Just keep looking…believe it or not there are a lot of nice sexy people in the world who's main interest isn't only to have a good looking girl/guy on their arm.

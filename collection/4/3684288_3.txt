That realy depends on the type of club you want. If you are trying to start a club of your own, it's usually looked down on as direspectful by those of us in an established club. However, if you are serious, you can contact your local dominant club and/or the AMA, follow protocal, and always show respect. I would not recommend just sewing a patch on your back and sayinf "Eff you, I am a patch holder." Starting your own club is hard work. It would be easier to find a local club and hang around with them for a while to see what it's all about, then if you think it's right for you, prospect for that club. Who knows, it may be the best thing you've ever done. If you have other questions, ask me at sickentwisted@yahoo.com.. . Kid Twist. Wolf Pack MC

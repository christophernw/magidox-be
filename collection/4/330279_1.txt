I got this from a different answer on here yesterday:. . Easter bunny= story about the Goddess Ostara finding a bird with a broken wing. She changed the bird to a rabbit so it would survive the last of winter. In thanks the bunny/bird brought the Goddess a basket of eggs it had laid, all brightly painted. Bunnies were also symbols of fertility.

Gun ownership laws vary from state to state, but they are all governed by guidlines from the Federal Government. In just about all cases, a citizen can petition the state to restore his/her gun rights, and usually an administrative law judge would be assigned to review and determine the case. In cases involving violent/ sex/ drug crimes, it is usually very difficult to get your gun rights restored, however it does happen. The best way to determine how to proceed is to contact both the State Police in your state, and the FBI. Those 2 agencies are who determine who gets to own guns and who does not. They can both give advice and direction on how to file for restoration of gun rights.. This is a great example of American Democracy at work: For every law, there are loop holes designed to legally bypass or challenge the law. Nothing is static in this country. That is part of the checks and balance system. You just need to determine how best to work the system to legally get what you want.

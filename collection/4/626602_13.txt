I have a jealous partner! I love him to bits, (he had a tough time with his last girlfriend), anyhoo I have been with him for 5 years and just do my best to reassure him, If I meet new people I make sure he gets introduced to them as soon as possible so he doesn't jump to conclusions, I include him in plans and nights out because to be honest I prefer to have him out with me anyway, as I said I love him and enjoy his company! I think it would be strange to have a partner that doesn't get jealous....it would be like they didn't care! If you love the guy help him through it if you can't be arsed with the hassle dump him!

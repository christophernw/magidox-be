Is the original piece of paper 50 ft long?  No?.... . Ok, here's what you do.  You fold the piece of paper in half and then make alternating cuts (left and right being sure NOT to cut all the way to the other side) in very small increments attempting to make as many as possible.  When you are finished, you unfold the piece of paper and you will have a "string" of paper that will hopefully stretch 25 ft.  Viola!

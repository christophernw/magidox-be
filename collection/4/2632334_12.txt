Okay, pretending I am an objective non-human observer, I still say there is no reason to indiscrimately slaughter any life form.   Killing humans is as bad as, say, killing dolphins, or cats, or snakes.  Action without purpose is evil, I can't remember who said that, but as objectively as I can get, it seems to be a fundamental truth.. . Now, as an objective non-human observer watching humans kill humans, well, I suppose that's just the nature of the animal, none of my business.. . Now, I am human and i think killing another person for no other reason other than they THINK differently or LOOK different, or (the most favoured excuse today) they have something we want is pitiable for a species that likes to pretend it is evolving to a "higher being".

well how else are we going to identify the realy stupid people among us till they open there mouthes and say something truly stupid.. Sticks and stones may break your bones but names will never hurt you. Instead of being offended by what others say if you are smart enough you should reason with them and find out the cause of this radical idea of there's .. maybe they have trouble expressing them-selves so they are understood . i hate gays may not be seen by all to mean the same  thing. If you ask this person why  he may say he was molested by a preist and does not like gays. . Signs are to small to explain the meaning of what motivates an individual to speak out and to sensor this speach in any way is wrong by seeing and hearing others we have a chance to engage them in conversation and determine for ourselfs if infact they may not be right or wrong depends on your veiws does'nt it.

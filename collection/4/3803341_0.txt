Was just there over Memorial Day...In the Sea Pines area there is South Beach with the Salty Dog (inside and outside bars, restaurant, sight seeing boat trips, etc) and Harbour Town (more inside and outside bars, restaurants, sight seeing trips, etc.).  There are also alot of bars at Coligny Plaza with live music most nights...lots of different kinds of bands in the different bars/restaurants....anything from rock to folk to reggae to Elvis impersonator...Probably my favorite restaurant is Marley's Island Grille ...kind of like a Bahama Breeze...maybe nicer....good steaks and seafood...

ALOE, ALOE, ALOE!. Also, on your nose, tops of your ears, etc. You can use Neosporin. Put it on, turn on a fan (the cool air stops the burn from deepening) and keep the house cool. Take a nap and by the time you wake up, the neosporin will have "sucked" the intense pain out. Use it on the worst parts, not all over.

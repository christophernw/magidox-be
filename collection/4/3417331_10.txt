It sadly isn't.Anyone in his right mind knows this "man" who lied about everything,from WMD to being greeted as liberators,lies which cost the lives of many young Americans and thousands of Iraqi civilians,who showed blatant disrespect for international law by promoting torture but never taking responsibility,who offended even his closest European allies,should have resigned and brought to justice long ago.. It never crossed his mind and it never crossed Bush mind before now when he thinks it can somehow help him politically.Bush thinks this gives him some more negotiating room with the Democrats.. All the human loss,suffering and crimes Rumsfeld brought weren't enough.Bush once again shows what he meant with bringing back decency to the white house,political strategy is all that matters.I sincerely hope no one falls for their lies anymore.Rummy just took one for the team and is replaced with another neocon.. Abu Ghraib was a war crime,he should not only resign for it but be in jail for it

- Follow your teacher(s) in the school.. - Do your homework.. - Try hard to solve the problems yourself before you ask anybody.. - If someone helps you solve a problem -- take time to go over the steps.. - Finally, practice, practice, practice.. . Your emphasis shouldn't be on memorizing. Math is not about momorizing, it is about concept.

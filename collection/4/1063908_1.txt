A hilar mass just means that on a chest x-ray or CT/MRI scan, one sees that the center of the chest area seems enlarged. It could mean many things, but a common reason is that the lymph glands there are enlarged. This could be cancer, but it could be something else entirely, so talk to your doctor about it. Good luck.

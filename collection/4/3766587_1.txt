Money USED to just be a paper representation of what gold we had backing up whatever money was out there.  So if you had five bucks in the bank and just wanted your gold, you'd fork over your five and the bank would give you five's worth in gold.. . Some f--king genious decided to print more money when times were tough, though, which caused inflation (that means the printed money was worth less).  That's why IF we had enough precious metals backing our currency today (which we don't) then when you took in your five clams for some bling, you'd maybe get a buck fifty in gold.. . The system of credit further ruined everything, because found new and exciting ways to exploit buying without money, not to mention the f--king catastrophe of bankruptcy, yada, yada, yada.. . But now it's all ones and zeros in a giant computer somewhere.  I only hope WWIII wipes it out so I don't have to repay my student loans.

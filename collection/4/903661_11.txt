According to an old liberal lawyer I heard on the radio the other day,  The lawyers of today don't care about what is right or wrong,but rather what's legal and illegal.  If they can win a case by some little thing out of place which has really no bearing on the case, even if it means ruining a decent person,or sending someone to prison and bringing on all the hardships to someones family,the lawyers will do it.  Winning the case is everything.  Also,lawyers selling out their clients is not an uncommon practice among them.

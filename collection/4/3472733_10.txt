Pirates wore hoop earrings.. The pirates believed that putting pressure on their earlobes (i.e., by wearing earrings) would prevent them from becoming seasick. Another suggestion for the purpose of a gold earring is that when a pirate died, the gold would provide some kind of funding for a funeral and coffin.

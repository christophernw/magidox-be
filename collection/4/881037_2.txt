School is work, but extra credit it the way to raise without putting in much. See if your teacher has any avable, then do it all in one blast. If it making poster do 6 in one night (That is what I spent last Wensday doing) It will take some time, but it gives you room to slack off. Even though i suggest putting in an effort.

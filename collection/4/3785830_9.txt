Put your car away and walk.  Recycle, recycle, recycle.  Think about how to use things more than once and what you throw in the bin.  Avoid plastic whenever you can.  How many of those little plastic carrier bags are shoved under your sink.  Take your own carrier bags with you when you go to the store.  I carry  a straw basket with paper bags inside for if I need to carry more.  Shop at the market when you can.  Use the back of store reciepts to write out your shopping lists.  Think of the paper we waste!  Don't let the water run when you brush your teeth or are working in your kitchen.  Start a compost pile.  Plant a tree.  Turn the lights off and don't turn them on when they are not completely necessary.  Everyone needs to get educated on the subject and then take individual action NOW!!

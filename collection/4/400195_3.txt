The teenage country i think that you could look for those in africa where all the children parents are dying.. And teenage should be respected because eventually we have to clean up the shit that the other generation left behind or we create some more shit depending on how we feel.then the other generation will help things or fuck things up depending on how they feel.like a pattern.

I think that alot of parents think it will spark an intrest in sex that will make there children go out and try to figure out what they are talking about. the problem here is alot of the time parents either are waiting for the "right time" and over look it or are just tring to save there childrens "innocents", however if the parents do not help there children understand then some one else will and usally that ends badly.

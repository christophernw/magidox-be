The same thing is happening in this country.Everyone is quick to blame parents  or over eating.I wonder what muck they put in our food,additives etc.My dog is 12 years old I changed her food after finding out Iams experiment on dogs.She had an allergic reaction to Gluton,they put rubbish in dog food & I think our food is not that far behind.

Because most mysticism was a result of people getting into some stuff that they shouldn't have...or being possessed by demons, influenced by the Devil, etc. Christians believe that everything that happens happens for a reason, and that God intended for it to be that way...and he was the one to make it happen. Whether by his own hand or through us. Therefore, if anything "magical" were to happen, Christians would not say: "Wow! That was just like magic!". They would say, "Wow! It's a miracle!"

Taking money out of your 401(k) is a BAAAAAD idea.  The fees and taxes will eat up about HALF the money you get (10% early withdrawal fee and you still have to pay taxes - as much as 25-30% - because it was pre-tax income).  If you take out $10k, you'll only end up with about $5k.  Roll it over into an IRA or other savings/investment vehicle at your bank or a brokerage house.. . To pay the bills for now,get a short-term contract job, or 'part-time' work (delivering pizzas, whatever), have a garage sale, get rid of the car payments by selling your car and getting a beater car with the cash you have left over.. . Pay for food, shelter, clothing, and transportation (gas) FIRST!  Then IF there's money left over, pay the credit cards and other non-essentials.  If you are having trouble paying your debts, contact the lenders BEFORE they start calling you.  Many lenders will work with you on deferring payments for a month or two.  Just remember, you're still accruing interest.. . Hope this helps!  Good luck in the new job!

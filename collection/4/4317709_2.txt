The most important thing is to not put any pressure on her or tell her that she's the only one of your girlfriends who hasn't achieved an orgasm through penetration. Just be patient with her and give her the feeling that it's ok for you if it doesn't happen. . . I don't want to be rude, but have you ever thought that your other gfs might have been faking? Sorry, but a lot of women do that so they don't disappoint their man.. . Just keep doing like you are right now, and it'll eventually happen. Had the same problem and it was solved through patience and lots of experimenting around.

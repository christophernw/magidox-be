Now, we all know, that, a witch with a capital "B" is a female dog.  And, a female will sleep with her own pups.  Therefore, this is an insult to a female of any race. And, to the guy who referenced the "n" word, are you trying to say that Black men are the one males to call females B's?  Well, dude, you're wrong!  Oh, Rechelle you need to be a bit nicer when answering other's questions, okay?

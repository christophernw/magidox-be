Just stop. Pot is not physically addictive so you don't have to worry about withdrawals like with most other drugs. It's all psychological. If you don't want to do it anymore, then find new friends that don't do it all the time. Find something else to keep you busy. I think you will see when you do stop that you actually enjoy life more. You will see all the simple things that you were missing out on because you were in such a haze all the time.

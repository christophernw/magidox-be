The sunlight does not push the water up the plant.It is the xylem and phloem tubles in the stems that transport water from the roots to the plant.Plants grow towards the presence of sunlight.For eg:u have a box and made a small hole.You put the plant in the box and seal the box.sunlight pass into the box from the hole.Few days later,u see the plant growing towards the hole.

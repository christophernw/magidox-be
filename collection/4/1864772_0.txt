I would suggest looking on a train times website, there are loads of them and they are usually pretty good.  Dpending on where your friends live you might need a train to piccadilly or Oxford road or victoria (this is on a different trin line to the other two).  The metrolink tram system is really good once you're there and some train tickets allow you to get on the tram links for free but I'm not sure which ones they are, sorry. Happy travels :O)

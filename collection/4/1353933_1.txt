Calcium is essential in muscle contraction, oocyte activation, building strong bones and teeth, blood clotting, nerve impulse transmission, regulating heartbeat, and fluid balance within cells. In the U.S., between about 50% and 75% of adults do not get sufficient calcium in their diet. Adults need between 1,000 and 1,300 mg of calcium in their daily diet.

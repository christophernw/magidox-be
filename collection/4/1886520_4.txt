Full colour 3D film is made by filming from two camerase, separated by a distance similar to that between your eyes (or wider if they want to exaggerate the 3D effect).. . The two images are then replayed onto a screen using one of two approaches.. . In the first, the images are projected alternately onto the screen, and special glasses black out one eye or the other so each eye only see the image that is meant for it.. . In the second, the images are projected through polarising filters placed at 90 degrees to one another (the filters slant at _/- 45 degrees relative to your eyes - think about why this is). In this case the glasses you wear are simply crossed polarising filters, so that the right filter blocks images meant for the left eye and vice versa.. . The polarising filters approach suffers from unpleasant artefactgs if the viewer moves his or her head out of the horizontal, but the glasses are cheaper and lighter.

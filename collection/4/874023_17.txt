Here in Canada it is produced by Kraft, and is available in most grocery stores in the spice aisle, I love it but find it is only sold in 4 oz jars, and one or two serving and your toast, pardon the pun.. . It can be used in gravys, sauces, and is nice mixed in to onion chip dip for an extra tang, even when you under the weather, like chicken soup, mix a tablespoon in hot water and drink it down, you will feel better in no time.

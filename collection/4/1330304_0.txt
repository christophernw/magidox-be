you can either take it to a shop and let them do it or you can start by getting a drain pan wile your car is cold ther is a little drain plug on your lowwer part of radiator. let it all drain if you can jack up the rear of your car so all the fluid will come out then close the plugg and refill make sure you check the fluid after lettin it run for a minut or so with the radiator cap off.

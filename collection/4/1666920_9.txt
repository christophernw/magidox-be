You probably don't have bad luck.  You just expect something different than reality.  You make bad decisions and when the consequences come you interpret it as bad luck.  For example if you speed and get a ticket you think it's bad luck.  I decided not to speed and didn't get a ticket.  I don't think you had bad luck, just bad risk-taking.  The problem is that you don't have a very accurate model of the world and don't take responsibility for your own actions.  I have seen this a lot with young people.

well it depends on the environmental conditions they are at.. . one of the major killers of light bulbs isn't the actual on time of the bulb...its the temperature at which they are at when the electricity is zapped to them by the light switch.  if the bulb is in an extremely cold room, and you flip the switch...the sudden heat up and expansion of the tungsten filament will cause it to break, and consequently fail to work.. . you can get the most out of bulbs by using on off switches that gradually put the current to the bulb, or by buying a special item that also slows down the current to the bulb. another thing that helps is by keeping the rooms to a more temperate level.. . without knowing what type of switch you have to the bulbs, or the environment they are operated in, i wouldn't know what is causing your bulbs to fail early.

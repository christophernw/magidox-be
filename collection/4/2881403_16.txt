if we define Pagan as a person that believes in many gods.. . (the word pagan was originally used to describe anyone that was not Cheistian. and later came to mean anyone that was not of your paticular monothestic religion. and now has come to mean anyone that worships more than one god.). . then Pagan is a very broad term.it would encompas thousands of gods and goddesses. and hundreds of different religions and solitary paths. . . Pagan is usually used by people that worship more than one god but also worship gods of different pantheons. such as Greek and Nordic gods. or Egyptian and Celtic gods just as an example.. . however some people define themselves further. I often say that i am a Celtic Pagan. to define myself as a Pagan that worships the Celtic gods and goddesses. . . Wiccan is a person that follows the religion of Wicca. it is a Pagan religion that has it's own rituals and beliefs. that are similar to but seperate form other pagan beliefs.. . niether are Satanic. this is a stereotype that igornant Christians put on anything that they do not understand, or quite frankly anything that they do not like. how many medieval scientists and doctors and philosophers  were called Satanic by the church?. . most Pagans (Wiccans included do not believe in a hell or a devil. we do not believe in an afterlife of punishment. we do (usually)believe in reincarnation and we believe that the crimes that we commit and the evil that we do will come back to us in this life or the next one.

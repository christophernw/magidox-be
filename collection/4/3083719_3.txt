This is very serious, you can't just stop taking anti-psychotic drugs without permission from a psychitrist.. . Why?. . Because it gets worse if you stop taking it and re-take it, it takes more time to be recovered.. Sometimes even worse, when you stop taking it, once you re-take it's no longer working.

As long as it's 1) not indeestructable, 2) does not have more than one function-like massaging, holding cups etc. 3) is made of non-hazardous, reuseable parts 4) uses the least mass possible 5) durable 6) easy to dissassemble 7) cost-effective 8) specific in its target audience (not one-size fits all) it'll be a good design.  Many chairs fit these criteria, but the designer makes it as stylish/modern as he/she sees fit, and the consumer judges whether it would look good in their home.

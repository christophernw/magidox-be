It's a small country wit beautiful mountains and the most beautiful bay of the Adriatic sea- Boka Kotorska... . I'm planing on visiting it this summer (both mountains and the sea).... It's a birthplace of Petar Petrovic Njegos who wrote "Gorski Vijenac" a crown jewel in epic poetry of all the Slavs (in whichever country they lived)...

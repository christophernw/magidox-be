mouth wash, you remember those tablets breath asure? Find them because even if you brush your teeth and use mouth wash, you still could need something more, from the inner side of your body. Because I think bad breath can come from your stomache, kinda like acid reflux, if something is going wrong in your stomach then it can cause bad breath. I hope this helps.

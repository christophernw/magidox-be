The laws are different in different states. Also, I am not sure whether this question is about a small claim court or not, but there are a lot to say.  If this is a small claim court matter, go ahead of represent your corporation because an attorney cannot represent the corporation in a small claim court proceeding.  However, if your corporation is involved in a larger lawsuit, get an attorney.  There is claim called alter ego that could potentially hurt your own assets instead of the corporation's.  Therefore, it is better to keep yourself separate from the corporation and have the corporation represented by an attorney.

As most of the other people have answered correctly. It's got a higher Octane level.. Which ACTUALLY means that it ignites more easily when exposed to an ignition source. The benefit of this is that the petrol is more volatile & burns faster & hotter by a marginal amount resulting in a more efficient use of the chemical energy...'more bang for your buck' sort of thing.. Not all cars are capable of using the higher octane grades as the ECU (car brain) in older and less powerful cars is not designed to utilise premium fuel and will simply treat the air/fuel mix as a standard '95' grade fuel giving no added benefit.. . Some older (pre 1990) cars have a small 'link' in the engine bay to manually designate to the ECU which fuel is being used and so alter the 'map' - if set to '95' and '98' is used - no benefit, BUT if '98' is selected and only '95' is used it can result in slight engine damage as excess air is added resulting in too hot a mixture.. . If you have a fairly modern, 'sporty' or 'muscle' car then it may be worth the switch - mixing them is OK, it will just result in a diluted premium / enhanced regular.

Forgetting the question... STAY AWAY FROM VARIABLE ANNUITIES. Read Forbes, Barron's & other articles on them.. . You will find;. Most investors should not be in them.. Their "hidden fees" are out of this world.. When you draw your earnings.... you're taxed at your earnings rate (of that time).... You're better off holding ETF's or stocks & just pay a minimum long term gain.  Mch cheaper in the long run!!!!!!!!!!!!

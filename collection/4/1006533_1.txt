Massive intestinal oedema often follows laparotomy for major trauma where there has been prolonged shock. Crystalloid resuscitation, capillary leakage due to activated inflammatory mediators and reperfusion injury all contribute to this tissue swelling. Combined with intra-abdominal packing or retroperitoneal haematomas this may render the abdomen difficult or impossible to close. If the abdomen is closed, intra-abdominal pressure may rise to a level (>25 cmH2O) where it leads to significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal and cerebral dysfunction.

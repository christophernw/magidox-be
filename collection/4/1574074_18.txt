One view is that your soul is composed of consious energy, much like your body is mady up of physical energies. When you die, the conscious energy dissipates and converts into other energy forms. This could be considered reincarnation. Or a "Lion King" style "circle of life" idea but for the soul as well as the body. (cliche analogy I know, but it is very direct)

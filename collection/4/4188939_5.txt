You will need to go to law school and get a J.D. Then, you will need powerful, local friends politicians appoint you to be a judge. Then, you will need to make political friends at the state and national levels to be appointed district judge, circuit judge, et cetera.. . And even after you work your way all the way to that point, you will still need to wait for an opening on the Supreme Court and HOPE that the President will appoint you. Your political beliefs will also need to match the President's agenda.

I used to have the same problem...you will have to keep yourself awake.NO NAPS..for a few days..You will find that you fall asleep that much faster at night. I started taking something to help me relax after my health got bad last year. I would go to your doctor and see if he/she is willing to put you on an anxiety medicine for a while to help you. Try exercising in the evening to see if you can decrease how much stress you are holding in..that may help you fall asleep faster too!

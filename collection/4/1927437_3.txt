Looks like they cut your question off!. If your question was "what should I do," the answer is to first get established with a good primary care provider who can watch you over time, take EKG readings in the office and refer you to a cardiologist if and when the time comes.  Depending on your family risk factors and physical health (HDL/LDL, BMI, etc) your doc might start you on some meds like lipitor... and he or she should DEFINITELY start you on a hydrochlorathiazide, a Beta-blocker or an ACE-inhibitor to get that blood pressure under control!

I think that we need more information to be able to answer this question correctly.  Is there a specific item that the cat is licking?  If you take a brand new, freshly cleaned, piece of iron, does he/she still lick it? . . Though it may very well be a response to the cat not having a proper meal, I kinda doubt it.  Today's foods for cats are pretty balanced and you'd be amazed at what they eat that you don't see during the day.  I'd put my money more on the item they are licking has something on it that they are after.  Be it something spilt on it, bacteria, mold, other cat juices...who knows.  If you can take a fresh piece of clean iron and they do it still...then I'd say diet.   . . Just keep in the back of your mind that cats not only hear better than us, they smell significantly better than us..which has a side effect of being able to taste better than us.  There just might be something yummy on that piece of iron you just cannot see with your eyes or smell with your nose.

Ripe "cantaloupes" should be heavy for their size, be very fragrant, and be slightly soft at the blossom end. The skin should be uniform with no soft spots or bruises and the netting should be fairly well defined. "Cantaloupes" really absorb flavors from other foods and should not be stored in close contact with strong smelling foods for any length of time.

Spheres are very perfect, stable shapes.  A globe turns in space pretty smoothly, unlike any other shape.  And the pull of gravity would get screwed up with another shape because some parts of the planet would be farther from the center than others.  Spheres are also sleek shapes to travel those long space distances.

I usually allow myself to start one new project for every two that I complete.  My New Year's resolution was to finish up some of the unfinished projects around the house... I made a list and boy were there a lot of them!  I pick one that looks interesting and go to it.  I've also found that there are some that I don't have the equipment, skill, or know-how to finish, but there you are...

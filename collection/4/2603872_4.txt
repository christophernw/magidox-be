Well if you are having trouble to convince them, is because of two possible things.. . 1.- you are a really wild boy, and they fear that you may have trouble.. . 2.- they are really closed minded, and they fear that them run into trouble on controlling you.. . My advice is to follow what they say, they will be not always right but the intention is always good, now, be patient, and also comply with their demands, offer to return early, and do it, as they see you get back OK, eventually they become more flexible.. . now if in the first time you get all wasted, forget it, is going to be boring for you.

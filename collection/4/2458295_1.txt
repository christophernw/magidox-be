If you're talking about a shuttle service (not the hotel shuttle), it is quite a bit cheaper than a taxi.  The difference is that the shuttle will be carrying several passengers, and will make several stops.  If yours is the first stop, it's great.  If yours is the last stop, it could take quite a while, depending on what city you are in, and the traffic/time of day, etc.

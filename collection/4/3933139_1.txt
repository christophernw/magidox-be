Looking at water: the difference of electronegativity between the H-O bond creates such a polar molecule that the surrounding H-O-H molecules are greatly affected.  Since there is a localization of electrons around the Oxygen, it would have a slightly negative charge in the molecule.  On the other hand, the Hydrogens in the water molecules have given their electrons to the electron greedy oxygen.  (remember, O is more electronegative than H).  Therefore, the electron field of the molecule would mostly be focused on the oxygen.  Now, when other water molecules are near, they all are the same where O is more negative, thus attracting the more positive H's from other molecules.  Therefore, this H--O interaction is the hydrogen bonding we are all looking at; this creates such a significant effect that when you compare water to other molecules such as ammonium or even CH4.

Sombody hit the button that says report abuse. I have had that happend recently to a question I answered that was said to contain profanity. I even put it up in here and no one that saw it could find one word of profanity. Unfortunately though the person was right that is was not knowledge related it was a question regardless..  There seems to be a few on here that are going through and just reporting for reporting sake. Maybe they think they are doing some good. Personally they will just send those of us who really enjoy answering questions, whether opinion or fact,away..  I have left feedback from the bottom of page and I would suggest you do the same. I do hope Yahoo can help those of us being chosen a bit..  The person was right that your question was not related to knowledge.But it was a question....

Are you black? Cause you're certainly racist.. Why do you group Black people as a whole? Not all Black people are racist. I'm sure as many or more Whites are racist than Blacks. But to answer your question, it is probably because we were racist and captured them and put them into slavery and didn't even think they were human. That's racist. They're just returning the favor. We probably deserve it.. . I just read your additional detail. I'm Chinese, okay. DON'T YOU DARE say that the Black Chinese citizens are racist. You are more than them all put together. You attack Blacks and Chinese people. Don't even think about putting another question up like these RACIST ones or I'll report you!

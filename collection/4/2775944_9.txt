I have vertigo and my doctor explained that your ear as fluid in the inner ear and also 3 cannels leading from the ear to the brain.  As you move, the fluid enters these cannels and lets the brain know the position your head is in.  The problem comes in when a small crystal forms in this fluid and when you move your head the small crystal enters one of the cannels, sending a false message to the brain.  Your other senses may indicate your looking up, however the crystal in one of the cannels may be sending a message to the brain your looking down - thus causing you to become dizzy.  My doctor also said there really isn't much you can do about it, just live with it.

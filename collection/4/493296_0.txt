The answer is mostly because the audio between stations and programs is never recorded at the same level.. . Also, audio for television programs is recorded to reflect a good dynamic range- that is, quiet scenes are really quiet so that there is more impact when any action occurs.  Commercials don't have the luxury of time to accomodate for differences in audio dynamics, so they hit you up front with "in your face" audio.

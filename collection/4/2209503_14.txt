Technically, you're both right, and slightly wrong. She's right because she's doing just what the Bible, and God, tells her to do, tell people about Him. However, she is wrong in not knowing her limits and knowing when and where to stop. . You're right, I suppose, in the fact where you  politely asked her to stop... Which is better than screaming your lungs at her and shoving her aside. heh.. However humorous that may be. However you are wrong in ....... let me think...... The approach, I suppose.. In my opinion, you should direct yourself to her and ask her why she suddenly started quoting the Bible around you, and even more when you are anti. [I'm not going to comment on your religion of choice, I'm not in favor of it nor am I against it.. Just to put that out.]. . But if you don't feel comfortable... My thoughts are to go to her and say something along the lines of, "Why are you doing this? If you know it makes me uncomfortable, maybe you should limit yourself. That's great you feel that way, but honestly, it's kind of getting to me....." You fill in the rest.. Doesn't have to be exact words. Just let her know how you feel, sure it seems kind of fruity and lame but still, it works to be direct and to the point instead of going around it and just assuming things.. . . Hope this helped some.. Sarah.

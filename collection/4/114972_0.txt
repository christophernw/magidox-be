Having retired after over 25 years in the prison system, I have met more than my share of these women - and while they are all different to some extent, they appear to share these characteristics:  low self esteem, the need to feel that someone "belongs" to them, the need to feel that little thrill that although he killed 17 other women, he "really loves me and I'm safe unlike the others", the need to know that he's not out tom catting around on her (of course, the fact that he is in all likelihood having sexual relations with other inmates is of no interest to her), and finally, a bit of a "martyr" syndrome.  There are lots of strange people out there, and they aren't all locked up.   Anyone who sends a fan letter to a serial killer probably should be locked up him/herself !!!

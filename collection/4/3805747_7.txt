You need to scrub the rust off and then re-season the wok. For scrubbing, any of the usual things will work, Scotch brite, SOS pad, etc.  Make sure you rinse it thoroughly and dry it on a stove burner until all the water has evaporated.  Then follow the instructions for seasoning your wok the first time and every time after you use it. Instructions can be found at www.wokshop.com. . It is the seasonaing or patina that makes the wok non-stick and acts as a barrier to rust.. . You will often see instructions never to wash your wok with soap, because the soap will ruin the seasoning or patina that you have painstakingly added.   The secret to doing this is to wash the wok immediately after the food is out of it, while both the wok and the food particles in it are still hot.  A wok is big enough that you have to have planned ahead a little and emptied the sink before you were done cooking the food.. . Another help for preventing rust is to hang the wok vertically, so that no moisture can accumulate in its bowl.

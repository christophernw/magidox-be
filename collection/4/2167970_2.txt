The Minutemen in Arizona got the subject raised again.  They were tired of seeing illegals sneak through their back yard every night.  I'm not sure if the folks in Washington can stop it but I think the former Governor of Texas is making more sense than the other politicians.  Keep in mind that when he's done as President, he plans to go back home to Texas.

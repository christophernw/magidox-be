I asked about the verses that say a woman should cover her head when I was at a church service a few weeks ago. The answer I got was a good answer, but I've not done any independent research into it.. . This was the gist of it.... . There was in those times certain other religions that practiced temple prostitution. These temple prostitutes shaved their heads. Many of these temple prostitutes were becoming Christians, and would come into the worship services with their shaved heads since hair takes time to grow. The fact that their heads were shaved was a sign of their profession and their old religion, and was therefore disrespectful and distracting. This is no longer the case... and so, it's no longer a problem.. . Like I said, it was an intriguing answer, but one I have not looked into any further.

Sex offenders do have rights.  Sex offenses are some of the most heinous, perverted, disgusting crimes possible; but that does not mean that a person who commits them should be deprived of all their rights.  If you committed a crime of a sexual nature, would you mind being just locked away without a trial?. Sex offenders should have a fair, impartial trial by a jury of their peers.  Personally I would just like to see them rot in jail.  But I do not wish to see them just "thrown to the wolves."  That would set a bad precedent.

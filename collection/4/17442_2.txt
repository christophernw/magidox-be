The news likes to hype things up. . There have been some shootings in my area in the past few years. . If you consider police shootings there have been quite a lot. But you have to remember that for cops the number is 30 to 1 odds.. I heard of one cop shooting where one cop got plugged with a through and through in the leg and the perp got 64 rounds into him. Needless to say he did not live.. 24 cops were shooting and let go with 190 rounds. . Proves that cops cant shoot.

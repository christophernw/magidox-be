First you contact your local police department -- . . The easiest way is to remove the ignition switch on top of the steering collum near the firewall - the key turns a rod that operates this switch and allows you to access the run / start / off  without a key -- however newer cars have more than a few security devices in place to ensure that this will not allow you to drive away with the car -- those i won't mention.. . The 'theory' is to provide all power requirements to the ignition circuits (including computer lines) and then engage the starter - in practice the security devices from the factory to avoid a simple jumper wire or two are numerous - and that is without aftermarket security systems.

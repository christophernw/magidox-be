No person has to do everything before they understand it. A psychiatrist can be married and still advise single people. A doctor does not need to have cancer to treat cancer patients.. Married people have problems that are common to just being people and priests and everybody understand and can help.. A marriage counselor would not have to have committed adultery to give advice on cheating.

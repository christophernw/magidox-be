Not sure if this was what you were looking for, but Google the Battle of Chalons (Battle of Campi Catalunici is its other name); this was the decisive battle that stopped Attila the Hun with General Flavius Aetius as the Roman general. Emperor Valentinian III was in power during this time. Hope this helps.

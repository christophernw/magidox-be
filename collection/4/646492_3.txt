there like little bears, territorial. Two males can get along but then they just go crazy. Like some invisible line was crossed but also if they were in-bred which most are they do tend to go crazy. My sis had two that mated and even though she seperated them in this big extended plastic cage a big female chewed her way through each killing the other hamsters. Two survived and we blamed the cat when my sister got home. We didn't want to tell her her mama hamster killed all her babies.

Let's say its the right ear that's blocked.. . Tilt your head to the right side, stand on only your right foot, and jump. The water should come out.. . Otherwise, pour more water into the ear, wait a while for the water to settle, then tilt your head to the right again.. . Do the opposite if its the left ear.

He trimmed the government and changed the way that things were bought by the government. He reformed welfare, welfare to work was his idea. He trimmed waste in government. At any rate when he left office everyone that wanted to work was. Unemployment was low and everybody had money to spend which generated More tax money. He was a brilliant politician and executive. Now look what we got. One sick puppy that doesn't know whether to shit or go blind.

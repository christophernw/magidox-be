There is and never will be a dipstick for the manual transmission.  There is a bold on the side of the tranny to take off, that is about midway up the side.  That is where you'd take it off to check the fluid level.  If clutch engagement is the problem, then it might be the hydraulic system for the clutch that isn't bled properly, or a slave cylinder is leaking, or bad, or the master cylinder to it maybe bad as well.

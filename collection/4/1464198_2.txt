I had a dog like went that way as a pup after a black skinned male teased him and poked at him when the pup was tethered in the back of a pickup. . . From then on any dark skinned person got him growling and barking. It took a bit of work in training, but eventually he stopped. . . So in answer to your question, it's probably related to some sort of psychological trauma with one animal and the other(s) may just be copying the other dog. Being an instinctive pack animal dogs do tend to copy/mimic each other.

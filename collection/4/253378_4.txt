Vote to keep property taxes low when possible because you have a house payment and a adjustable mortgage not gonna take too kindly to increase in the property tax assessment. Local tax dollars in suburbs areas growing are wasted on building amenities that 20 years ago a suburb never had like a community center with a water slide park, and high schools with computers students hardly use, swimming pools in high schools, and even worse than that business moving in and some of them get thier property taxes tax free while other business pay. People vote for higher property should think about people living on fixed incomes on soical security, and the people that dont have kids in school so that when they do want increase taxes the money is spent wisely and in open manner.

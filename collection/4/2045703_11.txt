To remind us of where we came from, and be appreciative of how far we've come? . . Who's to say God didn't intend for us to evolve from apes? . . NO ONE BUT GOD KNOWS:. . WHO. WHAT. WHERE. WHY. WHEN. HOW. . Some people need to chill with the whole God thing.. (Directed @ bible thumpers only).... . I never said I don't believe, I just don't preach what I don't know. That's not my job.

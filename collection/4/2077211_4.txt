I believe it was discovered by a green monkey in Africa.  It's a good thing he told a human about it, 'cause it's definitely real and has spread quickly throughout the world.  If it was meant to stay in Africa, that monkey has made a huge blunder and should be flogged.  We in the USA are doing all we can to help stop the spread but it's not enough.  All people need to be aware and concious of the devastation of Aids.  It's real allright.

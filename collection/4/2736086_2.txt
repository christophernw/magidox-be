In the Roman Catholic Church, there are two types of priest but all for the same church.. . 1. Religious Priest. 2. Diocesan Priest . . Jesuit or more known as The Society of Jesus is an order of the Catholic Church.. . The difference between a Jesuit (religious priesthood) and a normal priest (diocesan priesthood) are:. . A diocesan priest commits himself to a particular geographical area known as a diocese. e.g. The northern half of the state of Alabama makes up the Diocese of Birmingham. . . A diocesan priest promises to remain celibate (unmarried) and to be obedient to his bishop. . . A religious priest is ordained in the same way as a diocesan priest, but he belongs to a religious community such as the Benedictines, Franciscans, Dominicans, or Salesians and in this case, the Society of Jesus.. . A brother is a man who belongs to a religious community and serves the Church in a variety of ways, but is not ordained to the Priesthood. Like religious sisters, brothers have a special vocation which calls them to consecrate their lives to Christ and perform various types of works.. . You know what? We do have Jesuit Brothers too!. . To me, those who are Jesuit Brothers are greatly humble people for they go through the same training as any ordained Priest but yet choose to remain as a brother to work and to serve quietly.

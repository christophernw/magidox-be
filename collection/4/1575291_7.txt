Number one, there are hypocrites in ALL religions. All christians are NOT hypocrites. I understand the concept of buddhism and the karma theory. I'm a christian and i know that when i commit a sin, i have the abilities to ask GOD for forgiveness and He will grant me salvation. However, you must remember that though this method of gaining salvation is available, all christians do not utilize it. Everyone is held responsible for their actions in the christian faith. The christian faith has a similiar theory kind of like the karma theory. This isn't straight from the bible but basically, christians do believe that what goes around comes back around. Please don't assume that christians are hypocrites if you are not one. Just like any other religion there are those who don't practice the faith the way it should be done. Regardless of if you are jewish, buddhist, Apostolic, catholic, etc..it doesn't matter. If you don't follow the rules of your faith, then you could be considered a hypocrit. Christians stress that you should be as close to God as possible and commit no sins but it says that humans are sinful and it it up to you to WORK TO NOT SIN and if you happen to fall short, know that God still loves you and will forgive you if you ask Him and truly mean it. Lastly, for others who read this...if you are an atheist please do not make an assumption about others beliefs. I am a christian and respect your rights to not believe in anything. So please respect other christians rights to believe in something.

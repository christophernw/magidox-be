Practise, Practise, Practise.. Just keep on trying.. Read other teen fiction. it's depressing checking out the competition but well worth it, you will see what sort of quality teens these days are looking for.. If your really brave you can talk to a load of teens and see what they'd like to read about, what problems they face today and what kind of things they think about.. One author I'd recommend is Christopher Pike. He writes mainly fiction for older teens 16+, but...he can blow your mind. That's the only way to describe him.

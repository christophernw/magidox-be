It depends on who you ask.  "Naturism" is a more PC term to describe nudism, since the word 'nature' does not have the connotations to shock and offend that the word 'nude' does.. . Contrary to what some people believe, 'naturism' is not the same as 'naturalism'.  Naturalism is about the study of natural sciences such as biology, botany, zoology and geology although there are some naturalists who enjoy going around without clothes.

Guns were merely the advancement of bows and arrows. They were more accurate, had a better percentage of killing other people, and were easier to lug around rather than a bow/quiver with arrows. Besides, with guns you could have cannons, which came slightly after the discovery of gunpowder (which was used by the Chinese as fireworks for centuries.)

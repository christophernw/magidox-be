are you shy ? most people that are shy tend to emotionally removed from others.  I used to be very shy until one day I decided to take a stand so i started meditating the more i meditated the more relaxed i would become around people and eventually i was able to communicate without the awkwardness of feeling stupid if i didn't do something right ,or didn't say the right thing that used to make me feel embarrassed. personally by then i really did not give a damn

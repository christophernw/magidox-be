When you're young, you have a fast metabolism rate that helps burn up all those calories. . . You should however start exercising. I used to be like you, skinny no matter what junk I ate. I didn't exercise, except for the occasional game of football. You'll find that when you do need to work out later in life, it will be much harder for you because you haven't been doing so since you were young.. . Pick up a sport. It's good for you, and you get to make a few friends along the way.

im sorry for theses other ppl being so aggressive,im a christian myself.but i dont belong to any church.due to alot of misscoumunication,or lack of really trying to help other ppl.there is alot more to say but i would havt to exsplian it in more detail,and your free to contact me if you want to talk more on this subject.anyway i feel that you should just try to relax and let your heart guide you to god and becomeing a christian.it is you that must feel comfortable in your surrondings and your decsisions in what you do in life and on the road to becomeing a christian,as it stands you are already half way there with your views and morals and beliveing in a higher power.i call myself a follower of christ,just like when he walked the earth.my church is god.and i keep my own councile with him.so good luck in your journy.and may god bless you!!

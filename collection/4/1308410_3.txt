Arrange for a line of credit.  That way you can get the loan whenever you need to, it's like a chequeing account with someone elses money.  However, beware, you do need to pay it back... with interest.  This won't work for you if you actually need the cash tomorrow, but it will help the next time you need the cash on short notice.. . Similarly, if you own any credit cards they often provide cash advances. Or, you can simply use them to buy whatever.. . Of course you sohuld be aware of the difference between constructive and destructive debt.  Avoid destructive debt ( such as buying toys like televisions), use debt constructively to make money.

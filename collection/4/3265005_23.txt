Has to be the ability to shapeshift.  Not just into animals, but to be able to become anything, and retain my mind and senses.  It would so cool to sneak around, spy on people, no one knowing a person was even there.  Here's some ideas..... . 1) Osama bin Laden is examining a stolen shipment of missiles.  However one of these missiles is missing as he looks through the box.  He finds a homing beacon where it was and then hears the special forces choppers coming in to get him.  Turn into a missile, then the beacon.  9/11 gets justice.. . 2) Go undercover in banks to catch thieves.  Not as a teller, but as money.  A lot more effective than a dye pack if one of the crooks wad of 20s turns into 2000 pounds of lead, wiping out his car and pinning him in it.. . 3) I snore pretty badly, so instead of making my wife suffer, turn into a nice blanket at night.  What a nice way to cuddle!. . 4) It would make Christmas shopping for her easier too, since I could turn into her to try things on.  Guys are clueless about sizes for many things.  (I know, I've been wrong enough.). . 5) Never worry about forgetting something on vacation.  Well, not toothpaste, yuck!  But forgot the beach chairs, no problem.  Need a new tent because the old one ripped?  Sure.  What's that, dear?  You forgot to pack your swimsuit? :)

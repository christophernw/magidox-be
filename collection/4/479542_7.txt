According to christian mythology, the angels got upset when Jehovah announced that he was creating men of free will. They were used to being the apple of his eye, and couldn't handle the idea of competition. So they rebelled, and Lucifer led the rebellion. There were other issues with management, sure, but that was the main issue.. . So, instead of destroying him, Yaweh apparently gave Lucifer his own little kingdom. Kind of like moving an annoying vice president of your company to a remote office in Boise, Idaho instead of firing him.. . In short, he "decided to be bad" because he saw problems with the way things were, so he did something about it. Very noble. If we had more people like that in this country, we'd have a lot fewer problems... He's considered "bad" because he went against the establisment that defined itself as "good."

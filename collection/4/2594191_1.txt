I do! But it's actually Djinn not Genie. Djinns are spirits born from smokeless fire or trapped spirits in jars, like in the stories. Both good and evil, their mischiveous and dangerous. As genie they grant wishes but any way the find funny, even if it kills someone. For better info on what Djinns are and how to summon them look up Demonology websites!

First of all do you have a filter? If you do, then buy these tablets that are called WATER CLEAR TANK BUDDIES. Drop one in and watch it fizz.  It usually turns your water slightly purple at the beginning but in about 24 - 48 hours your water is crystal clear.  It worked for me.  This is of course if you've already cleaned your tank, and it still looks foggy.

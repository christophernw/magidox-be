forget all the physical stuff like food, water, air and money.. u need a reason to live.. something to say for things such as "oh ok, i will wait for 2moro to see that happening" . although the thing might not ever happen, if you suceed in making yourself beleive that it will happen someday, u will survive.. I personally keep living in hope that someday i will find why we are all on this earth.. that's the thing keeping me living

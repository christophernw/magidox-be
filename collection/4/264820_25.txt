Anything of God is good, and anything of the devil is bad. How can we tell what comes from who, though? We know that sometimes by our conscious, but completely from what the Bible tells us.. . For instance, in the Old Testament, the 10 Commandments pretty much cover anything that is "bad." But then the New Testament says it differently by telling us to simply love God with all our being and love our neighbor (everyone) as ourself and that is "good.". . The Bible also says that if you are God's child, you will know when something is of Him or not, since you belong to Him. On the other hand, if you have not chosen to belong to God, then you are of the devil and will do things of him.. . If you really want to know more about good and evil, I would suggest you start reading the Bible from Genesis 1. It has really helped me understand more about questions I have.

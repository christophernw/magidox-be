You are 17 years old. It's ok to be confused and have questions. You are still becoming the person you need to be. So I guess for starters it mught be wise to explore the possiblity that you may be BI or Gay. Even if you find out that you are gay, remember you will be loved for who you are by many people and God. Contrary to many on here he loves everyone.. . I would suggest you explore this side of you. Perhaps find a gay man or two to talk to and ask some questions. Then maybe find a nice guy around your age to teach and show you some stuff. Remember one thing. Make your first expereince the best you can. Find the right guy, not someone just out there to screw you over. Find someone with compassion and understand of where you are and what you need right now. Good luck.

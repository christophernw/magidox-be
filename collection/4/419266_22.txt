Too many people buy into the bigger is better idea. Its not just a bad idea about the price of gas it has more to do with the environment of the planet as well as the environment we are bringing children up in. Kids today will see it as normal, why because mommy and daddy are so damn greedy that the spend their children's college fund on a car just to look cool to the neighbors? I have four children and still drive a small, very clean and economical vehicle I have owned a minivan in the past but that was out of necessity to travel with all of them and my husband.

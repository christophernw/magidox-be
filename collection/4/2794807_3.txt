Well if you think she's failing you all on purpose go talk to the principal.  If you can reason with her, ask her if you can do extra credit or what you can do to pull your grade up.  Better yet, ask her if she can tutor you.  Teachers hate when they have to do extra work and maybe she will take it easy on you guys.

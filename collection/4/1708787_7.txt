The BEST, most 100% productive way to lose weight is a combination of three factors - healthful eating habits, regular exercise, and a good mentality.. . Other ways, such as diet pills, starvation diets, or malnourishment are ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ways to backfire, and sabotage your health COMPLETELY. To do this, you are risking years of your life. These are all silly diet scams, especially when you are at a young age.. . If you wish to lose weight, always eat healthfully! NEVER go under your daily caloric intake, or your metabolism will suffer. Staying consistent at a reasonable intake is good. Try to exercise a little each day, and stay persistence. If you accidentally overeat, don`t be discouraged! Just stay on track, and expect about a pound a week. Other diets claiming to lose more than 2 pounds per week are 100% SCAMS. These are terrible ways to lose weight, as you may be losing valuable, precious muscle. . . Good Luck! :)

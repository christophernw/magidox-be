Back in the day (Aztecs), kings would have themselves a iron dagger made from a 'magic source'.  The Gods would send a flaming ball of it to the Earth to reward the kings.  Redirect:  Natural metallic iron is not typically found, so people have to use smelts to get it.  There are other sources on here that other people answered but I thought I would share this additional info.

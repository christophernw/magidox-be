first of all, I have to ask about this vet:  what the heck?  that should not have happened.  competent vets should have a non-predatory method to restraining your bird, and released him if he was about to have a heart attack.. . getting another pet after the death of a first often time helps wonders in the healing process.  you don't need to feel like you are replacing them if you still remember them and the good times you had with them...

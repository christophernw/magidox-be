Dear Crayons,. It all depends on what you're writing about and who you're writing to. If they are personally close to you: Respectfully Yours, or Sincerely, would be appropriate. If they aren't personally close to you but in a respected position just say: Respectfully, or Yours Truly. . Of course, if it's your grandmother: Love, or Love Always.. I hope I have been of some help to you and now as I close.... ...May a Smile be Your Umbrella on a Rainy, Rainy Day.. ...Take Care, Iwannano

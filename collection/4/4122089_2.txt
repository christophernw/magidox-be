Tough question, the Universe had cooled to about 3000K around 100,000 years after the big bang.  At this point it would still be bright in visible light, at least where it is dense.  The issue is not just temperature, the universe while it was colling is not a hot-plate, regions of very low density can have enourmoud temperatures and still be transparent.. . The real issue here how spread out the universe was, it is really more the separation of matter, rather than the over all temperature of space that makes space look "black". . >>>>>. Did you know of the day:. Pope Pius XII declared his approval of the Big Bang Theory 1951.  This was reafirmed by John Paul II in 1996.. >>>>>

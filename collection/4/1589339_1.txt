It would be rare to have to smelt gold. It does not form oxides or compounds geologically. Prospector used mercury which gold will disolve. Then boil away the mercury leaving the gold (sponge gold) behind. Why there is mercury problems around mines. The other way is a solution of PCN, cynide. Those big pit mines dig up then dump the soil on plactic sheets. A drip of cynide over the dirt disolves the gold which runs out on the bottom of the plastic. Not advisable. You are liable to either go mad from the mercury or die from the cynide.

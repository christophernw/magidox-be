It's a question one asks to prove a point, where the assumption is that either (a) the answer is self-evident and known to everyone, or (b) that the question is generally acknowledged to be unanswerable. The basic point of a rhetorical question is to persuade someone that they are already in agreement with the speaker on one topic so that he or she can build agreement on questions in dispute. . . The other place rhetorical questions play a big role is in irony and sarcasm. And in humor, in general, where one will often find that the punchline of a rhetorical question is an answer - which it's not supposed to have.

the same way as we had/have places in the US that minorities can/couldn't go.. . it's hardly a one way street, except that wrong is wrong no matter which side you are on.. . and you are making it sound like this is something that is being legally down.  this is just as illegal as if someone pulled a black man over and beat him because he was on the wrong side of town.  . . this is something of few knuckle heads are doing, and the uk is trying to stop.

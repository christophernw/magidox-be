If you have neve been out of your country or met someone with a true tail of this it is hard to understand. I live in Italy and I see everyday immigrants and refugees around the city. These people have been poor and escaped here for a better life.Some on little boats holding over 25 people in horribly dangerous conditions. Dont get me wrong,of course there are those who abuse the system but the people I have met and the storys they have told are only a nighmare compared to the Freedom we do have.

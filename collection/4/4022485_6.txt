Depends on what you mean by being humble. You don't want to be abnoxious, but you also need to not sell yourself short. For example, I'm turned off by a guy who can talk about nothing but himself and will never admit when he is wrong, but I'm greatly attracted to someone who is confident. Sometimes you should blow your own horn! If you truly did something that was great don't try to hide it. I guess it comes down to having a realistic view of yourself, of your strengths and your shortcomings--and being honest with other people about that.

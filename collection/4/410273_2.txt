people do smoke marijuana some times to block out day to day problems ,but in the end they find out it doesnt help it just makes things worse.Example paranoia ,make you worry more .as for smoking its the nicoteen in the spliff that makes it more addictive ,and you crave more ....they say you get a craving every 3 minutes . . when you get a craving get up do something to take your mind off smoking ,because if you dont it becomes a vicious circle .

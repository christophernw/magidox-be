Voodoo is not going to do anything to you... unless you believe it will. Then you will start imagining all kinds of things. But it still is not the voodoo affecting you... it's your own mind. If you really think you need protection from voodoo, carry the dried foot of an alligator in your pocket or throw a handful of dirt over your left shoulder three times. The dirt gets into the devil's eyes so he can't do anything to you. Or at least that's what my Louisiana grandmother told me.

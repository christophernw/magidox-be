I hope you've kept track of all the time you've worked over after clocking out.  That's illegal!  Contact your state's Attorney General's Office, and ask them what can be done about an employer who makes you work after clocking out.  They should be able to do something to your boss, and it might result in your getting back pay for all those times you worked off the clock.. . Good luck!

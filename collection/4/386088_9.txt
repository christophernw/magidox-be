my  son has adhd.  we (his parents) knew he had it when he was 6 yrs old. but we didnt tell him till he was  11. hes on meds for it now.  and  i will tell u like  i told him.  you will find out more kids have it then you think.  just most  dont tell others. if you take meds you will  take a pill 1 time a day in the morning so its not like all will  see you. he  was making  really bad grades when he started jr high. teachers dont  spend as much 1 on 1 time so he was getting  lost in his  mind.  he brought grades up to A`s AND B`s.  just dont let it bug u.  take  it 1 day at a time. and be  a kid

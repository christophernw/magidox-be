The only way to tell if a person is good or bad is through observation over time.  "Let deeds, not words be your adorning."  This is why it is important to know someone IN PERSON for at least a year or two before considering marriage.  In the beginning of a relationship, everyone is kind, loving and reasonable.  But once you know them more than a year and observe them under stress, you see the real person.  None of us is 100% bad or 100% good, anyway.  I suppose you just have to decide how much "bad" you can accept.

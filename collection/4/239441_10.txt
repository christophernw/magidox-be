The Problem with commitment is not related to men. . It's a problem with anyone who really believes it is actually a choice & can be controlled.  . . Actually, men are really better than most women when it comes to the "commitment" thing.    Which means what BTW? What does it ACTUALLY mean? When does it ACTUALLY matter? Why does it ACTUALLY prove love? . . Women are ready to throw themselves and their lives into any relationship at the drop of a hat for fear of being alone or the stupid "bio clock" myth. They usually lack commitment to self. .  . Think if when you need a commitment reality slap: . . How many women are bringing up kids alone?. Bringing them up with men that are not the father?. How many women how 2 or more kids with the different men? . How many women are on welfare?. How many children?. How many women can support themselves & their children?. How many women can support themselves at all?. How many children are taken by DDS?. How many of them are living with single mothers?. How many women are killed by their husbands? Boyfriends? Exes?  . HOW MANY ARE ABUSED? . How many children are killed my their fathers? Moms boyfriend? her exes? . HOW MANY ARE ABUSED? . HOW MANY ARE MOLESTED?. How many girls? How many boys? how many babies? . How many are runaways?. How many are in gangs?. How many kids in gangs are living with their father?. How many even know their father? . How many fathers pay child support? . . Now asked those same questions for a man? . . How many people do you know that are happily married?. How many people do you know that are divorced? . How many couples you can say in your heart are meant to be? . . I could go on but it's too depressing. . . The trouble with these questions are REAL & are products of "COMMITMENT".  Commitment is an abused practice that people are brainwashed into thinking ACTUALLY means you care about a person or care about commitment.  . . It's really RESPECT women should be demanding if they feel the must demand at all.  Respect is a REAL commitment to any human being.  Maybe if RESPECT was the demand, these questions would not be so reflective of this world and the commitment problems. . . Commitment is not a pact or planned action or feeling you can demand.  Commitment is a feeling you have for someone you respect and love that is so strong that you FEELit with them only and you LOVE them from your heart and soul.

The only thing I want our military to do is to patrol our borders and stop illegals from entering this nation.They do not deserve to be in our armed forces.They are not citizens and are not loyal to this country.I don't want any more armed and military trained criminals out there .We have our share already.The military offers far too many benefits that anyone illegal should not have access to.No ,I'm sorry on this one I cant agree with you.. Laws can be changed and perhaps they should be.. . Does anyone remember Kent State when our national guard fired upon and killed legal American students that were peacefully demonstrating.So our National Guard can do that but its wrong for our military to protect our orders?

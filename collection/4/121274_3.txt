Unfortunately to completely understand this you need to understand the concept of limits and convergence.. Just see that. .9bar =.9+.9/10+.9/100+.9/1000+.9/10000        ...... This forms a series .. A series converges if partial sums tend to some limit if numbers of terms is made large.. i,e if I extend this sum to infinite number of terms the answer is finite.. It turns out this is a geometric series and sum is indeed 1.. You can understand the method you used by just considering the .9bar as a sum.That is x is a sum.This kind of thing is allowed if series is absolutely convergent.

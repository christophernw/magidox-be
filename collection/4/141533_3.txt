According to Wikipedia:. . A lingua franca is any language widely used beyond the population of its native speakers. Lingua franca has been used primarily for international commerce but is common in other cultural exchanges such as diplomacy. The origin of the term lingua franca is Latin (literally "Frankish language"), derived from the medieval Arab and Muslim use of the ethnonym "Franks" as a generic term for Europeans during the period of the Crusades.. . Originally "lingua franca" referred to a mix of mostly Italian with a broad vocabulary drawn from Turkish, Persian, French, Greek and Arabic. This mixed language (pidgin, creole language) was used for communication throughout the medieval and early modern Middle East as a diplomatic language; the generic description "lingua franca" has since become common for any language used by speakers of different languages to communicate with one another.

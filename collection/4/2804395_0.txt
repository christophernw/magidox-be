we judge mostly because we don't understand or refuse to understand; or because we are frightened; or unwilling to learn something new.. Being accepting of something or someone sometimes takes a lot of effort on our part and we don't always want to make that effort.. Being judgemental is a result of our upbringing, our environment and surroundings, our religious beliefs and our culture.

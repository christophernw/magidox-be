Celebrating the arrival and birthday of the great prophet, Jesus Christ, the only prophet to live, die, and arise from the dead. Who lived briefly, to carry a message from our Creator. Because of his life and in His memory, I celebrate His Virgin birth and the miracle it brought to the world.. . happy birthday Jesus.

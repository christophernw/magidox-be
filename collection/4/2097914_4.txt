I just recently had to train my puppy to get use to a leash.  The way I did that was by letting him get use to it first.  I would just lay it on the floor and he would play with it, that way he wasn't scared of it or nervous about wearing it because he was use to it.  Now whenever I get out his leash he is fine with it, he runs over because he knows he is going out.

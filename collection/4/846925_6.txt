Ed G is right, light has been stopped experimentally.  See his reference, it's also on-line. [See source.]. . By traveling "in reverse," I presume you mean towards a source of light.  The bean of light would make a sort of U-turn after leaving the source.  It would not back up.. . In fact, theoretically, it can be made to do a U-turn without "hitting an object."  If a gravitational field were strong enough, it could bend light all the way around back to the light's source.  This would be a relativistic effect of bending space under extreme gravitational pull.  [See source.]  As best as we can tell, there is no gravitational pull strong enough to actually do this, but it is possible.

Of course fish is a meat - it is a dead animal - the 'tradition' goes back to when any meat other than fish was a 'rich' mans food, but fish could be caught, so was considered a 'poor' mans food, so in having fish on Fridays it meant you were depriving yourself, as you weren't eating a 'luxury' food - and Jesus was crucified on a Friday.

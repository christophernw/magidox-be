Easy. . If you're dead then you are not alive so you are dead, if you are dead then how can you be alive, so you can not wake up dead since you are not alive but if you are alive then dead then you know you are dead so you have to be dead to wake up dead but you don't know you are dead if you are not alive but if you are alive then sure you know you are dead but after you are alive then dead you do not know you are dead so you have to be alive to know you are dead. If you are not wake when you are dead then you do not know you are dead. So you can not wake up if you are dead only if you are alive you know you are dead then after you do not know you are dead only if you were alive to be dead.. . . Got it. . Hope this helps

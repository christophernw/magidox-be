If you make a conscious decision to feign mental illness, it is called malingering and is usually done for some kind of gain eg. pleading insanity to go free. If the decision is subconscious ,it is called Factitious disorder and is attention seeking unconsciously. True mental illness, I am afraid we dont have a choice about.

It's not really the answer, it's more complicated than this....but...... your chemistry teacher probably wants you to assume that the acetate ion will take hydrogen ions away from water, leaving hydroxide.  In effect, that would create the same pH as a 0.4M solution of sodium hydroxide, for example.

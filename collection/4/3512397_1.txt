Hamas has openly and without question promoted violance not only against Isreal (A USA allie) but against the USA as well.  I feel not guilt  about the USA denie money to the Hamas lead government.  In fact I feel the USA had little choice but to with hold money from them.. . Yes the Palistinie had and have the right to choose who leads them but now they also have to accept the results of their choices.. . For example many people around the world don't like Bush (Truth is neigher do I) but as a USA citizen I have to accept the results of our country picking him as president.    I can try and campain against Bush at home but I certainly don't expect to force countries that don't like him to deal with him.  That's their choice.

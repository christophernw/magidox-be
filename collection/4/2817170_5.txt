It's as bad as, possibly worse than, cigarettes. Althought the risk of lung cancer and emphasema is diminished because you're not inhaling any smoke, studies have shown that the increased amount of physical exposure to the carcinogenic chemicals that come from the juices and residue of smokeless tobacco actually INCREASES the rate of lip, tongue, nose, brain, throat & lymph node cancers. Also, longtime users experience loss of smell and taste, gum disease, and extreme tooth decay. Do yourself a favor and quit NOW while it's still just a once a week habit. You will soon become more and more dependent, and then quitting will just be a lot harder.

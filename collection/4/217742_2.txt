Read Chapter 2 in 'The Great Gatsby' and stop trying to get everyone else to do your homework for you! :-) Honestly, the time it took you to turn the computer on, log in to yahoo and type this question you would have been half way through. 'The Great Gatsby' is a really fantastic book- there is lots of visual symbolism in there you just need to read it and make some notes!

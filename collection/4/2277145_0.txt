If you're talking about brown mucus from the vagina, this is probably from bleeding. When blood gets "old," it turns brown. You could be having spotting if you are between periods, or it could be just the early discharge from starting your period. I don't know how old you are, but if you are young and aren't menstruating yet, this could mean that you are going to start menstruating soon.

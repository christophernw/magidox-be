Phlebitis or Deep Vein Thrombosis can be caused by many things.  It can result in a falling accident causing a blood clot in the leg, or it can be caused by women who take birth control pills and smoke.  Phlebitis is most common in the legs, in a deep vein. The pain is so severe to walk or sit or lay down.  The skin may be hard and hot or warm to the touch.  If you have this you must see your doctor immediately or go to the Emergency Room. Treatments vary.  When I had it back in 1984, I was hospitalized for 3 weeks and was placed on two blood thinners.  But nowadays things may be done differently.  I hope I was of some help to you.  Good luck!

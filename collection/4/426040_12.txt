Hear Hear!. . I think this is the phenomenon of "Pot Stirring"... some people will do anything for a reaction or to justify their own twisted opinions.  I mean look at all the dumb ass sex questions out there or the meaningless  lame "What am I thinking?"... all for a few points on a random scale that in the end means nothing!. . OK, rant over, and I agree with your post.

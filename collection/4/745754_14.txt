weekends? Haha...unless it's changed since I was in...forget the concept of weekends. Sunday is called field day. This is where you spend your day doing such as scrubbing tiles with toothbrushes. There are Sunday morning servies you can attend...that's about the only relaxation we found...have fun on your "bootcamp weekends".... . ~USN~

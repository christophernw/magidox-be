I don't like the behavior of many Christians. A personal relationship with God and an honest attempt at living a Christ-like life should be the priority. I'm not sure why so many believe it is their duty to cram God down everyone's throat. God opens our hearts to Him when we are ready to receive Him. No amount of badgering opens a heart to any idea whether it be about Christ or about anchovies.  . . Peace :)

ok don't laugh now, but seriously ET scares the sh*t outta me, I'm 24 and still check under my bed and in my closet every night just incase.. So I would have to say aliens... My friends are as*holes too and sometimes they call me in the middle of the night and in an ET kind of voice just go eellliooottt.... and hang up...

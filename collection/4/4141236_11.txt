Email President Bush and ask him.  I think the general American public are confused...here is what we've been told so far via the media:. I)  Saddam had WMD's that were a threat to America. II)  To remove an evil dictator that threatened America. III)  Saddam and the Iraqi gov't were involved in the 9/11 attacks. IV)  To free the Iraqi citizens and spread democracy. V)  To create a more stable, diplomatic, democratic Middle East.... If I've missed any, I'm sure someone will correct me.  . I think the governments reasons probably have less to do with the humanitarian aspect, and more toward oil and spreading American interests.  Truthfully, I don't know why for sure, I just know what I've been told.  Only the President and his cabinet know the reasons..they just tell the media what they want the American public to know.

You need to take the cat to a veterinarian. It's the only safe and certain way to really get rid of them.. . Whatever you do, do NOT give your cat a flea bath/dip or use a flea collar. Both of those are extremely hard on the cat's system and can (and frequently do) cause mild to severe health problems. . . In the future, keep the cat indoors or, if she or he is used to going outside, make sure to give her or him frontline or advantage to prevent another infestation.. . Good luck!

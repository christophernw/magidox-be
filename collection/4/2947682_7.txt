I think most people who really value waiting until marriage are religous but there are practical as well as spiritual reasons to postpone sex.  Sexually transmitted diseases are more rampant than ever and protection is often ineffective in protecting people from disease as well as pregnancy.  A lot of casual sex can also be emotionally traumatic when the relationship breaks up -- sex is such an intimate act that it makes sense to keep it between two people who have already committed their lives to each other.

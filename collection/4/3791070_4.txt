Also, the reversed engine serves a purpose; as the train gets to its destination, and has to haul something back to where it came from, the engineer and conductor can simply hop into the rear-facing unit for the return trip, so that the engines don't have to be turned on a turntable, wye, or balloon track. This works just like a subway train.

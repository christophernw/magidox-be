LOL.  Some of the answers here are great!  I'm 27 and my husband is 25.  My husband can do pretty much whatever he wants (as long as he doesn't spend all the money or cheat on me, etc) but I do pull on his chain if he gets out of line...he knows I rule the house.  PERIOD!  =). . Control them by not controlling them.  Sounds paradoxical, but trust me, this way works.  They think they have all this freedom but you're really the puppet master!

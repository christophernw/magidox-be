I'd find a reputable breeder.  With dobermans, a 'good' breeder will have everything done for you when you recieve the puppy.  Usually 500-600 dollars is a good investment from a breeder who 1. Has the dew claws removed.  2. Has the tail docked.  3.  Has the ears cropped.  Korbella Kennels are very nice when it comes to Dobe's.  When I inquired about one of their pups, here's the e-mail I recieved.... . "Thank you for your interest in the upcoming litter.  It will be put in the oven late January, with the pups due in late March.  I will start worming the pups at 3 weeks old and then start shots at 6 weeks.  The puppies will have their ears cropped at 8 weeks old and be ready for their new homes at 11 to 12 weeks old which will put us into June of next year.  It's kind of a long process, but well worth it.  I am really looking forward to having them.  Both dam and sire are high drive dogs and I expect the same from the pups.  They will all carry a 4 year health guarantee and I've attached the contract for you to look over.  If you are still interested, you may put a deposit down to hold your pup.". . That's what I consider a reputable breeder, and a good breeder, and would not buy from anyone that offered less than Korbella Kennels.  . . www.korbellakennels.com

the common problem on 240 SX is throttle plate is binding cause by carbon deposit build-up.remove the intake air boot at the throttlebody and look for carbon deposit.clean it if it"s dirty.after that, open the throttle plate with your hand and it should move smoothly.if it not,the throttle plate shaft is bad.u need to replace it.

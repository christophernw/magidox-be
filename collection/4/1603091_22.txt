Same reason I drive a car. It has many good uses.. . I don't use the internet to drive God from my conscience, and I am able to share the Gospel with many people who normally would never see it.. . BTW, it also says God gives knowledge of witty inventions. So, don't interpret ONE verse to suit your purposes, and you'll be much better off.

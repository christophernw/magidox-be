Nobody seriously believes in Santa Claus except small children. It is an old fairy tale type of myth that everyone recognizes as just that long before they are adult. People may speak of Santa Claus as if he exists, but that is nothing more than a light-hearted manner of speech as part of the joy and celebration of the holiday.

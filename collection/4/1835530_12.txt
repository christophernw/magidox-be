The technical reason for answering services was probably the construction of fiber optic cables for telephone expansion.. But this is really in lockstep with another theory--The wealthy owners of American companies sat around a discussion table trying to resolve the problem of the middle class. How to get rid of.

No more middle class. All Lords and serfs (and eventually a third class-slaves).

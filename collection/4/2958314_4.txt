I would strongly suggest going to the Doctor and getting the poison ivy shot.  I dont know what it is, I just know it works.  I had poison ivy a couple of years ago, and it was spreading uncontrollably.  I was really uncomfortable, and it was heading to a rather private "danger zone".  So I went to the doctor.  He gave me a shot.  And the very next day, the poison ivy was rapidly going away.  Ill never mess around with poison ivy again!

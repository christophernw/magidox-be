The answer to Bart57 just because a club is all white or all black doesn't mean its racist.  The activities that the club performs or the character of the people would pretty much determine if they're racist or not.  I'm in a club that is all black except for one that is of mixed race but I'm sure that membership to our club would be open to any race being that wew have all races at the events that our club have.

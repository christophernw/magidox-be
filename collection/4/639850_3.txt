Materialism isn't just about financial comfort, it's about status.  Not all American women are materialistic though, as others have mentioned.  Lots of women dig power and confidence, and men who are motivated with a lot of drive.  They're more exciting. Rich dudes tend to be pretty confident, though whether or not they're exciting is another thing.  You gotta consider as well what it would be like to get pregnant and then have a man leave you once you have a child.  Now you need major bucks for diapers and formula AND you gotta work too.  . On the flipside, you could ask why most guys like hot women (I'm a guy and I only date hot women), cause once you've been with some, you don't feel attracted to a woman whose sorta cute or just average.  Lots of women complain about this, but lots of us guys gotta have a hottie, so us men slave at the office, and more and more women better hit the gym to compete with their fitter and healthier counterparts.. To me it's about degree.  If she's really materialistic then forget it, but if she's only a little or somewhat materialistic, then that's tolerable, and that's just life. . You'll often notice a correlation as well between a woman's self-image and degree of materialism.  Generally the more materialistic she is, the lower her is self-image is once you REALLY get to know her.  . Consider her upbringing as well. What kind of life did she have growing up.  Was she a super princess who always got everything?  This is a complex issue, but the bottom line is don't let it get you down... there are lots of ways to a good lady's heart.  The gold diggers aren't worth anybody's time.

That's an idiotic question.. . 1. Because all that's required is to believe in Christ and what he teaches. That's all you need to be a Christian.. . 2. Pretty much every religion in the world fights every other religion in the world. Even the denominations with a religion fight each other. What would make the Protestants any more different from anyone else in that respect?. . Incidentally, Catholics do the exact same thing so get off your high horse.

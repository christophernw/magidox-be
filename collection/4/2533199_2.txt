what seems like the most expensive answer will most likely save you money in the long run. use advantage or frontline to get rid of the fleas. any over the counter medicine is going to be worthless and a waste of money. vaccum as the other person says, but that won't get them off of the pets.. a lot of people have flea infestations during the winter. get it under control before your pets get tapeworms!

How long have you been a student?  I am a college student, and I can remember when I first started out I had no problem concentrating in most of my classes, but now I have problems concentrating and getting assignments, etc., done.  The problem with me is that I am getting burnt out on school, and I can't wait to be finished so I don't have so much to worry about.  . . You might also be pushing yourself too hard, too.  Take 20-30 minutes a day to do something relaxing, like take a bubble bath, or whatever you find relaxing.  Maybe take one day a week to go out and do something fun like go to a movie, or go swimming, get some sort of activity off the university campus.  Believe me, sometimes, my apartment and the campus seem like a prison to me, especially when it seems like I do nothing but stress over school.

A black hole is not a place. It appears to be. a place. Actually, it's collapsed energy that. at one time was a star.. . Recent experiments have shown that in some. cases, the "quarks" that emerge from black. hole energy are the same "quarks" that went. into what appears to be a hole.. . Should this turn out to be true with stars, then. it would be fair to say, the black hole a star. forms, is the black hole a star comes from.

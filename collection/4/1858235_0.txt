Don't listen to pmz.  Tricor as you probably know is used primarily to lower triglycerides (hence the name TRIcor) as well as to lowe LDL and total cholesterol levels.  Tricor is not used after to treat any types of allergic reactions after a CT with contrast dye.. . The most common side effects of tricor are abdominal pain, constipation, altered liver enzyme levels, back pain, and respiratory disorders.  Keep in mind however that most of these side effects occured in less than 3% of the people taking the medication.  . . Taking the medication with food will minimize the abdominal pain / stomach upset.  And going to your doctor for routine blood work will help you keep on top of any changes to your liver enzyme levels.. . Hope this info helped.

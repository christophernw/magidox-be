You should study voodoo to be good and ward off your evil.. . Devils and Demons are the same - supernatural spirits who feast on one's soul after inheriting it through infestation.. . The devil however, is usually linked in comaprison to God and that gives Satan a more powerful role as an entity that is as great as God but only evil.  The devil is seen as bigger than a demon, but they are not.  They are both evil and cannot be compared and should not be compared to God in any form (opposites or not)- cause no one can compare to a God.

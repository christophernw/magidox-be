Open windows causes drag on the vehicle, requiring more gas to maintain the same speed as the same vehicle with all windows closed.. . AC on means that two or maybe just one pump runs off the electricity from the alternator.  So, the alternator needs more engine power to maintain the same electrical output as compared to the same vehicle without its AC on. The electrical output comes from the turning of the rotor, and thus this uses more gas.

sublimation--that is--the phase change of moisture. Think about ICE. Starts as a solid, and then melts to a liquid and ultimately if enough energy is added, it will turn to a gas (steam). When a material skips a phase change--that is called sublimation. This is what is happening here in the jet contrails.

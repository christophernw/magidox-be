The japanese and chinese are always stealing from American culture.  There might be something in the US that was popular a long time ago, and might not be now, or might still be.  Then the across the world, japanese and chinese will discover that it is popular here and adopt it.  A great example is Karaoke. . . The same can also be said for the US stealing some cultural aspects from china and japan.

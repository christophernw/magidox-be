You can take the deriviative of a function (say f ' (x)) and substitute for x the x-coordinate of a point somewhere on f(x) to get the slope of the tangent line that passes through that point on the curve.. . The tangent line is the best approximation of the curve it is tangent to at the point of tangency.. . Also, you can use point-slope form ( y-yo = m (x-xo) ) to find the equation of the tangent line.

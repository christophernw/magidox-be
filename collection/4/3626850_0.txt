"...β-lactam antibiotics work by inhibiting the formation of peptidoglycan cross links in the bacterial cell wall. The β-lactam moiety of penicillin binds to the enzyme (transpeptidase) that links the peptidoglycan molecules in bacteria, and this weakens the cell wall of the bacterium when it multiplies (in other words, the antibiotic causes cell cytolysis or death when the bacterium tries to divide). Scott Williams is generally credited with having postulated this hypothesis. In addition, the build-up of peptidoglycan precursors triggers the activation of bacterial cell wall hydrolases which further digest the bacteria's existing peptidoglycan.. . In addition to the quadraceptics of mechanics, the bacterial wall can break down....". . So far some information out of Wikipedia. I would guess that human cells, while being an eukaryote cell (opposite to prokaryote in Bacteria), don't have some of the molecule on their surface that are being used by penicillin.

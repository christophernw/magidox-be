Originally to spite Tony Blair and Labour.  Second time round, I have no idea???  Hopefully they won't next time.  Maybe the votes for the other candidates were split.  I can't remember who I voted for, but I know I only voted for him because I thought he had a better chance of beating Ken than the other guy, but the other guy came second, so I was obviously wrong.  Maybe everyone who wanted Ken out, had their votes split between the other two?

A legume is one of the members of the family Leguminoceae. The shared characteristic of these plants is that they produce their seeds in pods and include plants such as peas, beans and lupins.. . The most important thing about legumes is that they produce nodules on their roots, which contain a bacterium called Rhizobium. This bacterium is able to fix nitrogen, i.e. convert gaseous N2 from the air into ammonium and ultimately nitrates.  The cycling of nitrogen is one of the fundamental nutrient cycles on the planet.. . In terms of agricultural production they are important because they do not exhaust the soil of its nitrates. When crop rotation was introduced in the 19th century by Turnip Townsend a season of legumes was introduced to the rotation exactly for thie purpose of resting fields after they had been used for nitrate-hungry cereals. In the modern era where inorganic nitrate fertilizers are routinely used, growing legumes can reduce the need for such addition. As in the nineteenth century they give the soil a chance to recover as legumes have their own source of nitrate. This gives other nitrogen fixing bacteria which live in the soil a chance to make the soil more fertile again. Gardeners can also improve soil fertility by growing legumes either as crops, or flowers such as lupins and sweet peas.. . One final interesting fact about legumes concerning nitrogen fixation is that they produce a molecule in the nodules called leghaemaglobin - similar to the molecule in blood. This binds oxygen in the nodule and carries it away, a necessary function as the enzyme which actually fixes the nitrogen - nitrogenase - only functions at low oxygen levels.

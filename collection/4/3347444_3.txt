If you take a dose too high for you of this drug you can feel somewhat numb. That is the case with all antidepressants. I've also personally experienced that this class of drugs can make you have just about any weird side effect. But they also can work wonders treating your depression. I recommend effexor, but keep an eye out for side effects at first. But usually the side effects are mild and go away after a couple weeks.

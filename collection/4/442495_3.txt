This is a function of human beings having two eyes that are placed in the same plane. For instance, if you close one eye, and try picking up small objects, it is noticeably harder than if you tried to pick up the small objects using both eyes. . . Also, if you were to have eyes like a fish, one on each side of your head, you would not be able to tell perspective.. . The mathematical explanation for this is simple trigonometry. To explain it in non-mathematical terms, think of a line going from the center of your head (equally between your eyes) to the object. This line is the true distance to the object. . . However, your eyes are offset from this line. The distance from your eyes to the object is larger than the true distance from the center of your head. The amount of difference from the true distance to the distance to each eye changes depending on how far the object is away. . . If the object is very close, then distance from the eyes to the object is much greater than the actual distance. If the object is very far, than the distance from the eye to the object is very close to the actual distance.. . Your brain interprets this as depth.

Money in the sense of an inheritance, is certainly less important than a career, which is based on four things:. . - your talent: what you do better than other people. - the world's needs: what solution you can provide, to help solve a problem or need experienced by other people. - your passion: what you like to do. - your sense of purpose: what gives you a sense of contributing to a better world. . If you mean money in the sense of the salary one gets for working and responding to the world's needs, then it is still less important than the career because it is only one part of the whole career.. . Good luck!

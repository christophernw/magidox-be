If you take a look at all the sightings, the mothman is a really creepy story.  He seems to fit somewhere inbetween ghostly omen, alien invader and child snatching vampire.  What's the truth behind the mothman?  Nobody knows for sure.  Chances are that some very strange stuff _was_ going on round that time, but that the many sightings were not all related.  There is definately a puzzleto be solved here- but the pieces don't seem to fit together (without using scissors and glue).     ;)

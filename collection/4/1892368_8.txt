Usually women know a lot about men's health because we have husbands too stubborn to ask the doctor.  And I really don't think there are doctors answering questions on here - too many legal liability issues.   I know some guys can answer but just look and see how many guys use it as an excuse to hit on the girl asking the question.  I've rarely seen a girl hit on a guy who asked an embarrassing question!

Check with your state employment guidelines.... . If you are schedule to work 10-6, and are required to take customers until close (say at 6pm) then you should be paid for the time you are actually there closing your drawer, etc.  . . If you are scheduled 10-6 and the store doesn't close until 9pm... leave promptly at 6:01.

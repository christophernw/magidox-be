It's not because we live in the past, it's the congressmen of the state. Anyways Gulfport has one and I think there is one in Meridian.  There are plenty of National Guard Armies in Mississippi though.  Just because we are a Southern state doesn't mean every white person is part of the Klu Klux Klan.  And if you read a history book or two we aren't famous famous for cotton, but soy beans and catfish!  duh!!

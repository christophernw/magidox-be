They think they are the entitled ones and believe they can dictate to everyone else morality to how your taxes are spent. They are fascist who don't believe in the constitution or individual rights. They have little respect for the law...as applied to them.. . They believe everyone who isn't rich, it's there own fault. In actuality. most should belong with us. Only 2 % own 90 % of the wealth, and most of the other Repobs are 2 paychecks way from being as poor as everyone else!. . . "My plan plays down an unprecedented amount of our national debt." -George W. Bush, in his budget address to Congress, Feb. 27, 2001

It has to do with how languages change over time.  The pronunciation and spelling of words (in any language) as well as grammar are in a constant state of change.  This change however occurs so slowly that we don't notice it as it happens.  Instead we have to look at change over time.  If you were to examine where cost/most came from and other similar spelled words you might see that most of them changed but for numerous reasons not all of them.  Often this can be because it's harder to say the word if it were changed whereas the other words may have been easier then their original or because one word is used more frequently so it's harder for the change to spread.  There are some other reasons mentioned in the book I read when studying language change and you should definately check it out if the subject interests you at all.  It's a good book and you don't have to be a linguist to understand it.

When you come into the house put your packages and purse things that you are carrying in front of kitty. Then close the door. You use these items to block Kitty's path to the outside world. Also have a friend come over with a squirt bottle and open the door have her spray kitty and make loud noises Kitty will associate the outside with the unpleasant experience. Just once of twice will get the point across to kitty.

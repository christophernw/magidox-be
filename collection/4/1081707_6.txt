Divide the total balance of each liability you owe by the min. monthly payment.  Pay off the debt with the smallest result first.  When that debt is payed off include that payment with the payment for the next debt.  Continue until aall debts are payed off.  The total amount you pay each month will stay the same, allowing you to pay more towards each debt as the others are payed off.  Make sense?

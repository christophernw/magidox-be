If some scientific papers are to be believed, life originated on Mars before making the huge transplanetary leap to Earth where it blossomed.. . We haven't been back to Mars because it was a boring place back then and the neighbourhood hasn't got better since - It's much better to view from afar than visit up close not least because it would cost a fortune and 6 years travelling. . As for research into preventing destruction by asteroids - there really isn't much use - a meteor big enough to destoy life on Earth,  travelling at orbital speeds will not be disuaded from its target by a thermonuclear bomb or two

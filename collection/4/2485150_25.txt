Could be many different reasons.. . 1.  They think that obesity comes from lack of control and look down on that.  Sorta the same way people look down on drug abusers.. . 2.  Many people who are obese have a low self-esteem.  Many cruel people will only attack the weak (low self-esteem) because they make easy targets.  If they attacked someone who was confident, they might get attacked back.. . 3.  They mistakenly think that teasing or cruelty will encourage someone to lose weight.. . 4.  They represent one of the last minorities that are easily picked on.  Because obesity is seen as a "disease of choice" (people are obese because they choose to overeat & not exercise) people feel that they can be targeted for ridicule.  i.e. obese individuals are attacked because it is socially acceptable.

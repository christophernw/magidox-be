The bulk of them are control freaks.  There should be a strict screening policy for officers so racists, sexists and power-hungry morons aren't allowed onto the force.  My parents know many of the officers in their small town.  Some of them are great!  Very normal, fair and polite.  Others are rednecks who wanted to carry a gun and tell people what to do.  That happens more than it should.

Bruxism isn't always caused by stress. Sometimes, a malocclusion, or misaligned bite, can cause you to clench and grind your teeth. It can also be a result of "Temporomandibular disorder", or TMD, a misalignment of the joint in the jaw. Ask your dentist they may be able to make a guard, customised for your bite.

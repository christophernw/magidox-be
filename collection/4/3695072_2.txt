You have many questions and answers regarding christianity.  If you dont believe in God or christianity and you believe its a bunch of hogwash or lies thats fine.  But why would it bother you so much if they think you are going to  hell for not serving their God.  You should feel confident and secure enough in what you believe that it doesnt matter what someones else believes.  I am a christian and Im sure there are religions that think Im being misled, maybe evening going to hell.  Im sure you have some thoughts about me and my religion that one could be offfended by. But  I say "whatever".  I dont care what anyone thinks because Im secure enough in my own beliefs.  Yet, i find people like you that seem to be very effected by what they think OTHERS think about them.

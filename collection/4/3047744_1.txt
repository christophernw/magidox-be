You use the distributive property of multiplication over addition. That is if a, b, and c are real numbers, then a*(b + c) = a*b + a*c.. Suppose you have the polynomial (ax^2 + bx + c)*(dx + e). By the distributive property, this is just ax^2*(dx + e) + bx*(dx + e) + c*(dx + e).  = ax^2*dx + ax^2*e + bx*dx + bx*e + c*dx + c*e.  = adx^3 + aex^2 + bdx^2 + bex + cdx + ce.  = adx^3 + (ae + bd)x^2 + (be + cd)x + ce. In the last line, we simplified the expression by using the distributive equality in a second way. This way is normally called factoring.

In any car, tread on the accelerator as if it were an egg you didn't want to break.  Anticipate needing to brake and take your foot off the accelerator earlier instead.  Don't use air conditioning.  Don't drive with the window open.  Don't carry heavy loads.  Make sure you tyres are inflated adequately.  Don't drive too quickly.  Don't use a roof rack!

Are you talking about a hybred of Lion and Tiger??? They are as big as a tiger or a lion..that is a BIG cat. They are not found in the wild because Lions and Tigers live on different continents..Africa and Asia. Lions are found in Asia, but they do not mess around with Tigers. There are no tigers in Africa.

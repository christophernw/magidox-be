a) Biologically, the fetus IS part of her body... they are connected via umbilical cord. The fetus CANNOT survive without this vital connection, thus it depends upon the mother for life. . . b) It is expensive and difficult to adopt. If people like you would work to make it easier and cheaper to adopt, then more people like me would find it to be an acceptable and reasonable alternative. Until that point, you cannot force all of these children to just "arrive" without proper care channels in place. These care channels should NOT rely on federal or state tax dollars, as it is not the responsibility of the state to care for other peoples mistakes. . . c) There are oppositions to the conditions that lead to abortion. Conservatives do everything possible to stop them in their tracks. Cons rail against sexual education in school, demand that contraception not be available, and attempt to force their religious beliefs regarding sex, life, and contraception on the rest of the population. Cons are a twisted group; they are the only ones still exhibiting an ounce of shame and values but they are also the only ones perpetuating the problem. . . As for the lack of health and child care, well, it isn't the responsibility of the federal government to provide either of these items. . . No where in here do you mention working on the CAUSE of the serious problem... our society is seriously ill becuase of a complete downfall in morals and shame. Better than asking why some people are "pro-choice", ask why people think it is acceptable to be "pro-choice" in the first place. We now live in a society where anything goes and no one is made to feel "bad" about their choices. It is fine to be gay, hop between sexual partners, dress like a hooker, get married and divorced again and again. It is fine to be pregnant at 13, have five kids by 20, and live on welfare your whole life. If we as a society would start to say again that this is not acceptable, then you'll start curbing the problem.

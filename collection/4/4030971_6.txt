depends on the asker and the askee. god is good.some believers may not know what god is whilst some non-believers can be very much in touch with god and not know it. god is a word for an ideal that cannot be explained or taught only discovered, which is why there are so many books written about god and they all differ.people believe what they want, and the written(or spoken) word can easily be manipulated.that's what i think, i could be very wrong.

Unfortunately, discriminating against people with pets is allowed, even though I have seen children do more damage and cause more problems in apartment buildings than pets.  The only thing you can do if you cannot afford to buy your own home is to keep trying, is try renting from a private owner and offer to give an extra amount of security deposit if someone allows you to have the dog there.

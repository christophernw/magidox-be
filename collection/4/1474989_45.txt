The best answer I have is that perhaps God needed your friend in heaven more than he felt your friend needed to stay here on earth...the best part is that one day in the future you will see your friend again...walking streets of gold and singing with the angels!  God does not kill...no one really knows why he allows death other than it is the result of sin and evil coming into the world... I highly suggest that you take the time to talk with either your pastor or school counselor or another friend as you try to deal with the death of you best friend... do not try to do it alone or it will eat you up inside!  You were in her life for a reason and most likely having known her will help you in ways you cannot begin to imagine right now...  Learn from her mistake....and go on...become the best woman you can in tribute to her...!

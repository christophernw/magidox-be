We all know the camera lense is very delicate, and the best way to clean it, must first be solved, by what to clean it with. . .  Okay, so! .... ((googling it, is not the best idea, since internet sources are full of junk)). . . To clean your camera and any separate lenses you own- keep it simple. I've heard too many stories about people damaging their cameras by doing too aggressive a cleaning job. For most purposes, I suggest you use just three tools to clean your camera-. . a microfiber cloth, . . a sable artist's brush, . . and a rubber squeeze bulb. . . Most of your cleaning should be on the camera's exterior. . . .  use a microfiber cloth to give a general cleaning to the camera body and the front of the outer lens element. In a pinch, if there's no microfiber cloth handy, I suggest using a well-worn cotton t-shirt or handkerchief to clean a camera or lens. Why suggest a worn t-shirt or handkerchief? . . Because, the more worn the cotton fabric is, the more likely it is to be soft and lint-free. If you have a really stubborn fingerprint to remove, you can breath very gently on the lens to let a little moisture from your breath condense on the lens, and then wipe it with the cloth. . . sable artists brush---...why this?. . Just to wipe off any dust on the lenses, make sure not to touch the metal on the shutter, if it's a modern exposure camera.. . Rubber squeeze bulb--  well, just basically to blow away any access dust and dirt, without actually breathing on the camera.. . . Need more info?

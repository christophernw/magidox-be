You take a measuring thingie - can't remember the name of it right now, too early in the morning for me - and wrap it around your chest just below your bust, write that measurement down.  Then you wrap the thingie around your bust line at the largest point and write that down.  You then subtract the two measurements.  If I remember correctly and I am not sure how they do cup sizes around the world but in the USA it is something like the following:. 1" difference = A cup. 2" difference = B cup. 3" difference = C cup. 4" difference = D cup. . Hope that helps.

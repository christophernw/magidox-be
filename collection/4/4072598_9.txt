Keep ice on the nail until it clots. It may take sometime depending on how short you cut the nail. Next time you clip your dog's nails, look closely at the nail and you will be able to see a white tip and a black part that connects to the paw. As long as you don't cut the nail past the white tip, your dog will not bleed. On some dogs, it is hard to see the line between the dead nail and the vein, so ask your vet for some clipping advice. Good luck!

logic say by replacing it, now every tube, lamp has type printed so, before you try to remove it, see those numbers just in case you break it, then you can get another one, some little lamps use a kind of fuse called starter and sometimes lamp is good and starter is broken, other times it can be broken the transformer called ballast, some lamps have two pins and you can get them out by turning them, others by pushing toward one of the sides, some others are screwed so, you might turn them like any light bulb. I was doing lighting in a big building for some years.

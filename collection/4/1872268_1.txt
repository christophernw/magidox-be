Bipolarism is a condition in which the person affected suffers from both depressive and maniac episodes; he/she can feel very sad and down for some time, even days, and then become very happy, energic, and hiperactive, both out of the person`s control. It can be triggered by both external (emotional) and internal (chemical- health) reasons. It can be treated with psicotherapy (conducted by a psycologist) as well as with medication (prescribed by a psyquiatrist). The combination of both gives the ebst results.

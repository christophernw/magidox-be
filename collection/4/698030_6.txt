not sure why ur not asking for help finding a J-O-B instead, but........ what state r u in? i know here (from past deadbeat roommates who abused the system) that u call the department of family services, and ask them to mail u the applications or forms required, and then u fill in the info, and mail them back in. just be honest, don't lie like she did. and try to find a job! welfare is ok if u truely need it, but u shouldn't rely on it.

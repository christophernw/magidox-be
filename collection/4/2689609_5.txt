Many people chose to bury thier heads in the sand and ignore what's going of it it doesn't personally affect them.  Many others feel that they have too much going on in their own lives to help others (these people don't realize how much can be done with very little effort).  Some others chose to believe that other people will help.  Sadly, there are those who simply don't care.  People do need to realize that what harms one harms us all.

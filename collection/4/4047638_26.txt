It sounds like you are the coward. You are afraid of people's disbelief of god. I do not believe in god, and it has never been proven. What you use for proof is terribly subjective and circumstantial. I have never found your "proof" too apply to me. I do not believe in god at all. I never will. I see religion as the corruption of society. If you disagree with me, that's fine. That's my opinion and I am not threatened by yours at all. I am glad that you are somewhat comfortable in your lifestyle. I do find it sad though that you have to challenge others to affirm your own beliefs for yourself. that is sad.

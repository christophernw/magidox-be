The world that we see through our senses is only a shadow of the true world, the world of Ideas.  Plato believed in a metaphysical realm that is in some sense "truer" than the world that we perceive through our senses.  The world that confronts our senses is but a faint and inferior copy of that Ideal realm.  So the shadow-show cast on the wall of the cave is the world that you perceive through your senses.  If you could but escape from the cave and view the world as it truly is, a world of Ideas, you would behold the source of the shadows that you had mistaken for reality.

It's because blue is the colour that scares the germs in the toilet the most. It is actually the blue colour that gets rid if the germs, it doesn't kill them as the adverts lead you to believe, but the germs leave the toilet because they are so scared of the blue colour. You can try putting anything blue down your toilet and it will work in the same way.

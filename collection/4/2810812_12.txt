I left my husband for his best friend. I'm not usually a terrible person but the guy and I had feelings for each other before we were married, and my husband at the time was abusive to me. and couldnt keep a job. I still feel bad about it because it was his best friend but if he would have treated me better then we may have stayed together. I also dont regret my decision. I have been married to my husband for five years now and Im still very much  in love with him now as I was then. I just feel guilty that I had to hurt my ex...

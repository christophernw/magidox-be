I don't know why we do that but I would like to apologize because I know it is inconsiderate and rude to throw them out like that.  I put them in my pocket after putting them out when I am out somewhere and there is no ashtray to toss later.  I know that is nasty but better than throwing on the ground.  Although I do smoke myself I don't feel that smokers should enjoy more rights than others.  You have just as much right to a polution free breath as I do to pollute mine.  Sorry.

When it comes to prayer for Salvation for others - God can set up the situation that can result in Salvation even if it means taking them to a whole new low so they have no place else to go - BUT - ultimately such people must make that final decision themselves.. . While nothing is impossible for God..., he will not make that final decision for the person(s).  Either we accept him willfully or not.

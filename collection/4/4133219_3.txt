Look in glove box or on door jam for factory tire size for starters. Your truck might have been ordered factory with a lift package. Simple fix is they make a side step that mounts under the rocker panel under your door. Aftermarket or factory mount, or running boards work if you don't do alot of four wheeling otherwise the running boards become like a big ski.

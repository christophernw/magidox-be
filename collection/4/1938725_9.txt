Your dog could have a skin irritation. It could be that it is allergic to fleas. She may not have them, but one can jump on her and bite than jump off. I have a dog that is that way. Ask your vet if there is something that you can get to help with this. Mine recommended cortisone shots or Benadrill cream. I use Jerkins Healing lotion. You want to take care of this soon, because she will scratch herself bald.

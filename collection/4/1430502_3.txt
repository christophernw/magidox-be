The theory can best be explained by using the example of a fire truck. When the truck is coming at you, the waves are being compressed because of the truck moving towards you and the distance between the sound waves being shorter, thus causing a higher sound and pitch. When the truck is going away from you, the sound waves are further apart, thus causing a lower sound frequency

Fabulous question for sure, I would say it is as simple as good vs. evil.    We may be the only living things on earth that have them, however, we are also the only animals that go out and kill other people for reasons other than to breed or to protect ourself, unlike in the animal kingdom (there wouldn't be any Ted Bundy serial killers in the wild animal kingdom).  Good vs. Evil and free will.

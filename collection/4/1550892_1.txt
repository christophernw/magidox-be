First electrons have no affect what so ever on nuclear stability.. . Roughly speaking in order for a nucleus to be stable it must have approximately the same number of neutrons and protons. (for larger nuclei you need more neutrons than protons).. . In a nucleus there are two forces  that are important: the strong force and the electromagnetic force. The electromagnetic force causes protons to repel each other, and is trying to rip the nucleus apart.  However the nuclear force (which acts between neutrons and protons equally) is the glue that holds neutrons and protons together. The neutrons are needed to put space between the protons which weakens the electromagnetic repulsion.

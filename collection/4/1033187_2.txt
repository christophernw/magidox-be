The controversy is over FETAL stem cells.  The problem here is that the fetal stem cell debate is another battle in the abortion wars.  . . The pro-choice people want to make abortion seem more moral by having fetus tissue used to cure some dread disease.. . The pro-life people see this as a way to make people think that some good will come from abortion, and therefore more ethical.. . That's the debate, in a nutshell.. . There is no debate over other stem cells.

Our laws are pretty messed up, but i dont think a burglar can really sue you and win if your dog bites him while he is in your house.  You can kill a burglar that breaks into your house and get off, its called the make my day law.  But anyways, you should get a lawyer and sue them for everything they are worth, for all the emotional trauma to your daughter.

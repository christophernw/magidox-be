Hopefully it's in the toilet tank and not the bowl.. . It has to do with replacing water that would take the same place as the brick.  So that's the water that you save, maybe 16 oz.. . By the way sometimes you have to flush twice when something big needs to go down.. . What I do, is I ditched the regular toilet and bought an Eco friendly toilet that's pressurized.  It uses less water too and stuff goes the heck down!

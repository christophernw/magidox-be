Most people who aren't religious don't "hate" Christmas.  They just don't want the religion crammed down their throats.  They especially hate it when religion is crammed down their throats and the people doing it don't even realize it.. . I don't see any evidence that liberals in general hate Christmas.  Where did you get this idea from?

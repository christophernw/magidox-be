A lawyer can try to show through the evidence that his client is guilty of a lesser crime like attempt or aiding and abetting or conspiracy.. . For instance, if a person has been indicted for murder, then his lawyer may be able to show by the evidence that he did not actually commit the murder himself or was unsuccessful in the murder. Thus, the client would only be guilty of attempted murder or something less. Attempt is still a crime, but the punishment is typically less in most jurisdictions.

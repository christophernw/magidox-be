The best way to do it is, go out clubbing alot, usually to clubs with same producers and become friendly with the promoters and staff.  That's how I did it back in the days. . . . Man, haven't gone clubbing since I tied the knot.... Damn, it's true, life ends after marriage.....NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!

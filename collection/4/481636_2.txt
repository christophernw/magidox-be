No, they are one in the same.. The mysterious Orient has given the Western World a multitude of dog breeds from rare Tibetan Mastiffs to popular Chow Chows, from silky Lhasa Apsos and Shih Tzus to loyal and courageous Akitas and Shiba Inus. The most endearing of these favors from the Far East may be the Pug Dog, a small, monkey-faced companion with the heart and soul of a canine many times its size.. . Like most gifts from the Orient, the origin of the Pug is lost in the mists of ancient civilization. The breed is probably more than 1000 years old and was developed as a beloved companion of royalty from the same stock that produced the Pekingese.. . Emperors of China's various dynasties from the Shang Dynasty 3000 years ago bred a variety of small dogs as companions. These dogs shared in the special attention accorded their courtly masters; they had their own attendants and rode in specially built carriages.. . Apart from a stretch from 1368-1644 when cat breeding was the rage, the small dogs were favorites. By the end of the 17th Century, breeders produced "sleeve dogs," dwarf specimens small enough to hitch a ride in the huge sleeves of royal garments. By this time, the Pug was distinctly different from the Pekingese and the Lion Dog. As Chinese ports opened to European traders, dogs were among the commodities offered. The Dutch East India Company probably brought the Pug to Holland, and from there the breed went to England.. . When William III landed in England in 1688 to assume the throne, he had several Pug Dogs with him that sported orange ribbons, symbol of Holland's House of Orange. The British took these spunky little dogs into their hearts; about 100 years later, they were favorites of Queen Victoria and of France's Josephine. The English Queen ended the practice of ear cropping for Pugs when she called a halt to the practice for all breeds in the country. Ear cropping remains against the law in England.

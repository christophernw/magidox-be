Most people do not realize the difference between adoration/worship (which is due to God alone) and veneration (which we can show even towards creatures).  . . One poster here mentioned that Protestants do not worship the Bible, but the One who inspired it.  In the same way, Catholics do not worship saints:  we worship the One who "alone is Holy", God.  But in venerating the saints (as Protestants and Catholics both venerate the Sacred Scriptures), we Catholics acknowledge the Supreme Holiness of God, who is the Author and Source of all those who become holy (the saints).

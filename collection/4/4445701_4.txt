Deary me..  I'm Irish too, and I am able to write properly in English, or so I hope..  The standard is equally deplorable all over the English speaking world, but I do think Americans are the worst.. One explanation offered itself to me when I heard from an American friend that her 10 year old's essay was not marked for orthography despite its atrocious spelling, because the teacher insisted this would curb the children's creativity.

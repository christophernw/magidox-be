along with some other suggestions on here, here's mine:  fill a bathtub with the hottest water you can stand.  sit on the edge of the tub, put your feet in the water, and put a bag of frozen peas or ice, etc. on the back of your neck.  This will help the blood move from your head to your feet... works for me everytime.

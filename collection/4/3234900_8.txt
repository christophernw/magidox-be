"How do I train my cat to cross a busy street without getting hit?". . A. You DON'T!!! ..........DEE-DEE-DEE!~Carlos Mencia. . Just keep her inside. Keep her fed well, de-wormed, vaccinated and SPAYED!. . Sometimes cats can learn to play fetch. It depends upon the cat and how independant they are. The more independant, the less likely they'll want to try.. . I think you need to find a GOOD forever home for this poor kitty and RESEARCH animal behavior BEFORE you get your next pet.

Speculation but probably correct.  When Black women were owned by plantation owners they were protected by the plantation owner.   If anyone abused them or raped them then the plantation owner would hunt that person down and probably hang them.  They would certainly have all the support of the other plantation owners to protect their “property”.  . . When slavery was abolished the plantation owners no longer had “interest”.  Unfortunately the people just set free had no protection.  The police department and legal system will still the same as it was before the war.  So being an ex-slave and running to the police would probably only lead to being abused by the police.. . Developing a law or winning the war that does not take into account the ramifications will always lead to this.   Look at Iraq now, we won the war but it seems the war between the people is just starting.  Before it was kept in check by Saddam's strict enforcement.   Now freedom allows people to take vengeance on one another in a way that law enforcement cannot control.. . Mark

You realize, of course, that "Freedom of Speech" is a reference to the First Amendment, and states that GOVERNMENT shall not abridge the right to free speech.. . Yahoo ain't the government.  Yahoo is a private entity that can run its service as it pleases.. . It's amazing to me the number of people who try to be a$$holes on services like Yahoo or other private forums, then cry "Free speech!  Free speech!" when they get slapped down because they're being a$$holes.

There's a few answers already given that I agree with.  There's also one other possible explanation that should be considered.  After undergoing similar intensity and duration workouts on different days, I noticed the ammonia effect could vary significantly.  Eventually I came across some material online from a doctor with fitness experience (I'm still looking for the link!).  His explanation was that the body is releasing cortisol that tells the liver to start breaking down amino acids (from within your own muscles).  This happens after other sources of nutrients are depleted.  This will happen either if you have not eaten enough of a pre-workout meal or if your workout is very long or intense.  Once I started taking a half serving of Myoplex or other fast absorbing protein/carb supplament half an hour before working out, this problem went away.

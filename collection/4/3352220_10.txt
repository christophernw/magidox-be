Very humorous. Naturally, I would be called hypocritical. She insults people who have lost someone in the Twin Towers, wants to take women back to the Victorian Era, supported the Apartheid, and several other nonchalant remarks. Don't believe me, take a look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Coulter, and then tell me how much you respect her. Read that and see why the hell Libs don't like her.. . Sternness.

Clay is one of the portions of the soil.. Everything starts from a mother rock.. Mother rocks are usually eroded for thousand of years into loess or just simply raw material.. With many, many, years of exposure to heat and humidity they get thinner in texture and that's how they finish being clay.. Clay is the most thin texture in a soil.. Thinner than sand and loam.. A soil rich in clay is usually called ''texturized''.. Soils rich in clay usually are also rich in organic materia.

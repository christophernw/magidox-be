there are many things other than tourist things to do in San Antonio. There's the Zoo and the missions and of course The Alamo, the Hemisphere tower(have dinner there or take a spin) The Rivercenter mall ( 3 stories) take a boat barge ride or tour the city thru a carriage ride (downtown) take in the sights thru a tour company. Many many things to do ... enjoy!

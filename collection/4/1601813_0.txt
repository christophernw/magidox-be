Yeah, a lot of people in power aren't big on opposition.  God threw Adam and Eve out of the garden of Eden, the Spanish Inquisition burned anyone who they decided was a 'heretic", the British tossed Gandhi into prison, American cops beat and sicced dogs on people fighting for their civil rights, the S. African government did the same with Mandela.  It takes a lot of balls to stand up for what is right - and sometimes you have to pay the ultimate price.

Without getting into the technology too much, an analog camcorder will record the sound and video to magnetic tape, like a VHS tape.  A digital records to computer memory.  If you are planning on transfering the videos to your computer and burning cd'd or dvd's out of them, go with the digital.  If you don't have a computer, go with the analog.

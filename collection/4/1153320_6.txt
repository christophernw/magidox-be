U Sound like me - I always ask myself this question!. I use to be a healthy weight but outta no where all this weight suddenly appeared :( . We are both consuming more then we need and are probably not doing enough exercise to work off this food (well i know i'm not!). Don't limit yourself to what you can & can't eat because u will only crave those foods you cant have even more and end up bingeing. Treat yourself now and then and limit the amounts you have.. Changing your diet is a liefstyle change not something you can just do for a few weeks. I'm trying this approach and am slowly losing some weight. What it comes down to is that you have to want to eat healthy & be healthy in the long run otherwise nothing will work.. Im trying to take my own advice lol. Good luck, your self confidence is worth it & u can do this! :)

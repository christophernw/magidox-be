"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:9). . While my opinion is probably only one of many, I believe that if we confess our sins, it is like an admission that we know we have done wrong, and we can acknowledge and accept that we need to be forgiven for a given act, thought or deed.  To me, it's like an addict finally being able to admit openly that he or she has a problem, and by making such admission, we are more open to accept the assistance that is needed.  In the instance of confessing of a sin, we are admitting that we are not perfect, and we know that we falter, and we need intervention and guidance in order to live a more spiritual life.

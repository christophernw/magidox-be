The humidness in the bathrrom might dry them out. Remember to not wear them for too long. Its bad for your eyes and can cause lifetime damage. If you take a shower in the morning put your contacts on after. Buy some tear drops (they are clean water, saline) and put them in your eye after you shower. You eyes should feel better and the contacts will not feel dry.

Why are there people on here who keep claiming we've stopped evolving? There's no such thing as not evolving, as it is a PROCESS and not an EVENT. The evolving that happens on a larger scale takes place over millions of years. So we are still evolving, we just cannot see it because of our limited lifespan.. . Also, one could argue that adaptation is a form of evolution, just on a smaller scale.. . Sorry I didn't really answer your question, but after reading a few of these answers, it really started to bug me. Evolution isn't spontaneous, people.

Get good grades, do chores willingly, act nice and earn your own money so that it would show that they wouldn't have to spend their own money. Also, try showing them that you won't be playing the videogame all the time and if it is something like a virtual pet game, then you can say how it would show you responsibility or something like that, lol.. . Hope that helped!

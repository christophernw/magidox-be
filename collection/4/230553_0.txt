I think by "carrying capacity" you mean the infrastructure or facilities at a tourist destination to cater/handle the visitors.. . Since your question relates to back waters, Kerala, India; there appears to be no authentic measurement, yardsticks or even data for established facilities at any particular destination. Most of the facilities are under un-organised sector and it is not measurable as of now.. . To find multi-locations, you need to get to other methods and to avoid dis-appointment or inconvenience you may book in advance for your trip.

For several reasons:. . 1. Because life is getting busier and we have to work more hours/jobs to stay on top of bills. Therefore, we don't want to cook at home anymore, we'd rather just stop by McDonald's and pick something up.. . 2. Because it is more expensive to buy healthy food than it is to buy food that isn't good for us.

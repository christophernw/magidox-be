Check out this link: www.dhamma.org. . They offer free 10-day Vipassana meditation classes that are based on Theravada Buddhism (which is basically the oldest form of Buddhism that follows Buddha's original teaching very strictly). . . It's an awsome way to learn meditation if that is what you're looking for. And it's very 'Western' in it's approach since it's free from religous rituals and ceremonies and stuff. All you do is 'sit' and 'observe'.

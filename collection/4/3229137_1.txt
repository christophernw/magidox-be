Usually because the drops of rain do not fall very fast.  A small raindrop (about 0.5 mm across, as found in typical drizzle - about the size of a salt grain) falls at only about 2 metres per second.  Larger drops (about 5 mm across - the size of a housefly) fall at about 9 metres per second, but even at this speed and size, it is not sufficient to cause more than irritation, certainly not pain.. . So basically, the drops aren't heavy enough and don't fall fast enough.

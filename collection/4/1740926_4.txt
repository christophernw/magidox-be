To the people who wrote it, the heart of the document was the list of grievances, not the philosophical justification that is in the introduction.  The colonists had actually written a lot of other complaining documents, complaining to the king about what Parliament did, complaining to Parliament about what the king did.. . The Declaration of Independence stands out because it was a de facto declaration of war against England (even though the first battles of the war had already happened) and because it communicated very strongly that all the colonies were together on this.  It also stands out because historically, US leaders have actually tried to put the enlightment ideals of the introduction into practice, even if they did a rather imperfect job at it.

The first humans remains were found in Africa, therefore, the first human was black.  As the population grew, and humans migrated to other parts of the earth, skin color adapted to the change in the environment.  It got colder towards the north, so skin became lighter, eyes, etc.  Like the eskimos: their eyes are slanted to protect them from the very cold wind, and their skin is like leather for the same reason.

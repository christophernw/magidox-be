Australians often have difficulty being understood when conversing with foreigners.. That's because they use different words e.g. cookie vs biscuit, and pronunciation.. However, since Australia has a high percentage of immigrants, things turn to more difficult when people have different backgrounds and first languages.. What you need to do is, use simple English and be polite. That will always work!

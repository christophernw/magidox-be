It's all stress related. The adrenelin, your mind is in overload and your nervous. You might also have test axiety. Taking tests can be very rough on your body. If you are in high school, see if your school has counslers to talk to about test taking and ways to make it easier. If your in college, go to your specific department for your major and do the same thing. Alot of times universities have test taking and even overcoming stress mini siminares you can go to for free. I highly encourage that. Even talking to your teachers and letting them know will give them a heads up. . . **Words of advise. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER cram for an exam. Been there, done that, and it's not good for the brain. Most importantly, make sure you are rested the day before an exam. When your tired, your mind is not as fresh and you sometimes can't remember everything than if you had a good nights sleep. That is the most important thing to incorporate.

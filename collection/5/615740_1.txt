The average cold lasts 10-14 days (sorry!).  To have a speedy recovery, drink lots of water, take a multi-vitamin every day, and eat chicken soup (they've done studies that show it works).  You can also try taking ginger and garlic capsules- they can both help,  I've also heard a lot of people say Airborne works well too- make sure you rest!!!

get one of those two gallon Glad storage zip lock bags and place your hands and onion in there so the chemical fumes from the cutting of the onion can not get to your eyes or nose.... . run the water and cut the onion under the ruining water..... . trick someone else into doing it for you...... . get one of those new kitchen aides that cut the onions in a special container....and it is sealed as you cut them.... . . but the frozen one already cut up.... . good luck. smile

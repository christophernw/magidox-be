Buy yourself a rail pass! If you will be using the trains that much over such a short period of time, I highly recomend one. you can look at a bunch of diffrent options here http://www.eurail.com/ Grab a map and plan from Italy and head north. If you run out of Rail time by the time you get to Finland, you can always fly Ryan Air from Finland to London and then back to Italy on a budget. Check out www.ryanair.com for a list of locations and where they all connect. Hope this helps, safe travels!

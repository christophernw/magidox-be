My grandmother always told me to count to ten.  It usually works, since I'd rather just stop acting all angry.  But if counting to 10 doesn't work, count to ten again.  It's recognizing the anger that is the ticket here, not how long it takes to cool off.  Recognize that you are angry and distract yourself until the initial rush is gone.  Then you will be able to think more rationally about the situation that made you angry in the first place.  . . My gram was cool.  Good luck.

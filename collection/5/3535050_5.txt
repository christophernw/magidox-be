The light from the sun is turned into energy by photosynthesis in the green plants.  Then humans eat the plants, and the energy is passed on to humans.  Also, another animal might eat the green plant, and then the human may eat the animal.  Either way, the energy from the sun is absorbed by the plants through photosynthesis, and then moves its way up the food chain.

When light flux collide with the atoms in your body for example:your have an effect called the Compton effect.. Light radiation of the flux arrives a certain frequencies at collison with atoms and the recoil is as follows;. some of the power is absorbed in your body's atoms . at a particular frequency .(  absorption). . The remainder of the flux is heat and light at different frequencies gets bounced back . There is it reflected back but with lesser power. The  change of direction of the flux would be called refraction.(bending of light) . . The original power of the radiation is the sum of the  reflection and refraction and absorption power.. . The absorption power is radiation at a certain frequency which we call heat.

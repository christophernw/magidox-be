Lila, Socrates' critique of democracy is three-fold:. . 1. Democracy does not require that participants demonstrate any special talent or ability to govern. The great skill they need is not reason, but rhetoric. And Socrates had no more use for rhetoric than democracy.. . 2. Beyond those who participated, Democracy surrendered administrative powers to individuals who had not demonstated a capacity to lead (as measured by experience, education or training). Thus, the welfare of the republic was always in jeopardy.. . 3. In arguments, Democracy treated all arguments as equally valid -- and adopted arguments that were based on popularity rather than correctness. Socrates was not value-neutral. He believed there was a right answer and a wrong answer. And if the wrong answer was popular, for Socrates, it was still the wrong answer. Democracy makes no such fine distinctions, and Socrates hated it for that reason

Hi, Cinders,  it could be that you don't have any close friends, to get out and about with, you should be enjoying life to the full, You can still ask questions when you are conversing with your friends, you don't have to sit in front of your computer, so ask your fairy godmother to magic you up a coach and get out there now, who knows you may even meet a magical prince.. ps. thanks for the 2 points

People in the US have many options for voting that already make it easy to vote. . Voting precincts are open 7am to 7pm. People can vote early in many areas, even on Saturdays.. There is also the absentee ballot.. . No matter how easy it is made, I fear that Americans have become too lazy and complacent to vote.. . besides, if it was a holiday, people would have another excuse to not vote....it's a Holiday and taking time out to vote on a holiday would just interfere with the festivities of the holiday. ;)

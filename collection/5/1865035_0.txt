The problem is the powerful 2 party system. Democrats and Republicans muscle out "independents" and leave us with a choice between 2 entire sets of beliefs.  We're forced to pick a party that fits us even if we disagree with much of the platform.  If we could level the playing field and encourage competition, the power would shift from the major parties to the people.

Up until 1975, cars used to have an electrical component in the distributor called a condenser.  I assume that's not what you're talking about.  An air conditioner works by evaporation and condensation, so I guess a condenser would be part of the air conditioner.  The radiator is the part of a water-cooled engine that cools the water that cools the engine.  Open the hood and you will see a fan that blows air across the radiator.

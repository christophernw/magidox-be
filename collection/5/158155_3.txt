It sounds like you are losing compression somewhere and that can be a few things, it could be the head gasket, or it could be the head itself is warped. The best way to find out IMO is a compression check of all cylinders, if you are getting normal compression in all but one cylinder, or adjacent cylinders then its a good chance the head is warped. If compression is low across the board I would suspect the gasket itself, but either way if you pull of the head you might as well send it to a machine shop to get it pressure tested and resurfaced if necessary.

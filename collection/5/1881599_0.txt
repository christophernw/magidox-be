The DNA which carries genetic information in cells is normally packaged in the form of one or more large macromolecules called chromosomes.. . A chromosome, from the Greek χρώμα (color) and σώμα (body) is, minimally, a very long, continuous piece of DNA (a single DNA molecule), which contains many genes, regulatory elements and other intervening nucleotide sequences.

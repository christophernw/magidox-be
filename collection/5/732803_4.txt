The Grignard reaction is an organometallic chemical reaction involving alkyl- or aryl-magnesium halides, also called Grignard reagents, with electrophiles. The Grignard reaction is an important tool in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds and for the formation of carbon-phosphorus, carbon-tin, carbon-silicon, carbon-boron and other carbon-heteroatom bonds.

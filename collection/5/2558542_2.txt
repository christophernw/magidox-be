You must be a certified medical lab technician, whether you have a university degree or not. Most places prefer 1 to 3 years experience as a lab technician, some like biochemistry degrees thrown in the bunch, and all want experience with blood assays, immunoflouresence assays, and all that medical lab techs do.  Of course, you must also handle yourself expertly with a computer, and know how to work under a great deal of pressure, that job is stressful.

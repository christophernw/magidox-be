Heterosexual relationships that last a lifetime often see the role of physical sex diminish over time anyway.  Lifelong relationships last more because the two people do a nice job of working to grow closer in all ways.. . In the end, people want to be with someone who they like spending their time with and who helps them grow and feel more complete.. . So to answer your question, it might be difficult for any relationship to last a lifetime in today's society - but homosexual relationships stand just as much of a chance as do heterosexual ones.

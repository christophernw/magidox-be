Slow down and breathe.... ok now get a planner (or an obnoxious colored spiral notebook like I have)*Gets my attention*. and write what you need to do in it every day.... . Start out with "in the next two hours I need to...". . Then work up to On this day at this time.... Once you get in the habit of forcing yourself to focus you won't need meds... It will also help your flightiness. . besides though drugs really screw you up and don't help later when you're supposed to be off of them and have the same problems...

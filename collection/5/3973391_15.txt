Well we're not JUST drunks we're lots of other stuff too.... . It all depends what u define a 'drunk' as. Me and my friends drink a fair bit but it never interferes with our jobs, families, ability to play sport r 'perform'.... . and by the way Jimmy Nesbitt wouldn't like to be thought of as representational Irish! Where he's from (Coleraine) they're very very concerned with their 'Britishness'. He's more Union Jack than Tricolour.

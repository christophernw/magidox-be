I believe it is mostly due to the fact that unlike other immigrants they tend to come in sizeable groups and frequantly. Their, usual, unwillingness to learn our language and to fource us to learn theirs to communicate with them really gets on alot of peoples nervs. Most nations immigrants usually learn our language quickly (or make an effort to) and/or already know it. I live near the mexican border so I see these on a daily basis.

The real reason why there are more insects in the summer than the winter is because the summer provides an ideal environment for eggs to hatch.  Hot muggy conditions provide moisture and is more conducive for procreation.  The mortality rate of insects also is less because of these ideal living conditions "assuming all other factors being equal" therefore we find more insect during the Summer period versus the winter

well, i dont live there. so i have no idea if they are or not. but, in relation.....a cultural group is only being mistreated if they let it. its all in your head so to speak. if you believe someone is trying to mistreat you stand up and say something. walk away, make them stop, speak out and use your voice. only way attitudes are going to change...if they continue. you have the choice to stay. go. or take action. god gave you a voice. use it. i believe no matter who it is....all people are equal. in the native culture we have a medicine wheel. on this wheel every race is represented there. no one is shown to be greater and less. i believe it starts with believing in yourself. the rest will show and take care of it self if you are treating your self with dignity and respect

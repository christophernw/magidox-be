Depends on if ya want a temperary power or if ya want 24/7 power. For a temp. power, try using nos or racing fuel. And for a 24/7 and depending on how much more power you want try anyone of these: supercharger/turbocharger (duel or single setup), bigger exhaust (duel setup if possible), upgrade your air intake, and use a bigger carberator (duel if you want more power).

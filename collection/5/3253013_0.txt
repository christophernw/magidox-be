The more you know Gods Word,..the more you can discern exactly who He is talking about in His Word.  God talks against those in the long robes that wave the incense; He speaks against those that bring in false doctrines;  He speaks against those that give in the open to let men see; God speaks against those that pray out loud for men to hear.  Point being,...the more you get to know the nature of God, then the more you know what He approves and disapproves of.  Another is in Galatians 5:22.  God tells us , Ye shall know them by their fruits, and in this verse He tells us what the fruits of the Spirit are, ...meaning the qualities that a Christian should show within them...like LOVE , JOY, Peace, longsuffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Meekness, temperance.  You really don't have to be a Christian to "test" the fruits.  Most know good from rotten fruit.

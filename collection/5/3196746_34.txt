Dab on straight bleach-be careful it doesn't run down the sides of the coffeemaker and able to get into the mechanics of it-will work to some extent but from own experience unable to get rid of coffee stain completely for ha soaked into plastic-can also shake on carefully comet , wet just a bit to activate then let it stay on for approx1/2 to 1 hr same with Oxi-Clean-if none work completely and it really bothers get a new coffeemaker and wipe spills etc right away so the stains don't set in.

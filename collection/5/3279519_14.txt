I can totally relate to the depression. The only time that I am not is when I am playin with my pets. Meditation? probly not. I am sure that may be a short term ( minutes? )  help, but once you are back to the reality of your situation you are back to square one. SO you have to find something that makes YOU happy. Whether it is a pet , reading ( not me )  or helping someone that needs it more than you!  For sure talk about it to a friend or family if you feel comfortable with it. If not go to a doctor. ( family one first ).

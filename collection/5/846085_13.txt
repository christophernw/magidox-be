where are hotdogs kept in the freezer so the expiration date is longer so you can keep extra hot dogs.  . and if you keep bread out it would turn moldy in a few days . unless you eat hot dogs every day. then you could just buy 2 packs of hot dogs. and 3 packs of bread 24 and 24. . . also everytime you eat hot dogs you eat a bun with it??. . the are lots of meals that can be prepared with hotdogs   not just served with bread  for example hot dogs cut up and mixed in your macaroni and cheese . . also the low carb-- or no carb people   dont use the buns. . . also how about this   8 hot dogs and buns for me and 4 just the hot dogs for my dog!! ha ha sharing with my puppy

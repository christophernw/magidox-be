Well... see... the SOUTH was not all about the SINGLE issue of slavery.   There are things in each of our heritages that we are not proud of... that doesn't mean that we should turn our back on our ROOTS.  Heck America went for YEARS not allowing our WOMEN to VOTE, or hold a JOB... should we NOT fly the AMERICAN FLAG?. . I don't think a confederate flag automatically implies RACISM... but then... I tend to think the BEST of people... I could be WRONG.

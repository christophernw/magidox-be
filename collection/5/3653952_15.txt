We're just proud to be southern.To be honest the civil war was based on money at first,then came the freedom of slaves.I'm glad that slavery got abolished,because Ive got some really good friends that are black.One even gots a tattoo of the Confederate flag on his right arm.Slavery still exist in this world and I think that should be a bigger issue than a flag.

If you mean how do you culture, pure cultures of bacteria, then one of the easiest ways is to get a culture plate of generic media (broad appeal media, not specific to certain bacteria types), clean a nichrome wire in a flame, dip it into whatever has bacteria you wanna try and culture (old mayonnaise, rotten meat, lake water), streak (run it back and forth along one side of the media),  clean the wire in the flame, alter the media by 90 degs, streak again, making sure the wire passes into the area previously streaked a few times, repeat one more time, place the lid on the plate, turn upside down and place in a incubator for 24 to 48 hours. Pure cultures (those grown from a single bacterium) will have grown up in the second and third streaking areas.

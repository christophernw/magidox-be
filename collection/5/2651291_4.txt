Yes.  Most abusers actually blame the person they are abusing. . Example:  Abusive husbands blame their wives for not cooking their food the right way, not having the table set the right way, saying the wrong thing, not washing their clothes the right way.  Anything that goes wrong is always the wife's fault, so the abusive husband has to "teach" her a lesson.

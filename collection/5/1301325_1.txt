Complicated. Something people have different views about. I think its something you feel when you are totally comfortable with someone. You're not afraid to be yourself. I don't think its the mushy stuff movies make it. Running my bath water and giving me roses only makes me think something is wrong. Listening to what I have to say and respecting me, is my idea of romance.

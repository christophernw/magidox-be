make sure you prepare for the speech. Rehearse it while looking in a mirror. bring note cards with you in case you become stuck or lose your train of thought. In all reality, it'd worse to say "um" while speaking publicly because it makes you seem like you have no idea what you're talking about. Ah can be played off quickly, while umm is a very distinctive, noticeable sound.

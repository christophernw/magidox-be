I don't think anybody really can, its self exclusive like a double negative. Something like being dead, in physical (not spiritual) terms can we really "be" dead? . Anyway its just a manner of speaking, to say that an action is attempted with no effect, or to no avail. . . Somewhat close also to making a "bluff" (which is basically encouraging the wrong opinion or simply put lying), OR drawing a "wild-card" (slightly different however in that this usually causes an effect that was previously unknown).

Start by eating totally unsweetened chocolate instead.  If that did NOT work then try eating your chocolate by mixing it with a food and/or a drink you absolutely HATE.   ...If even that didn't work then confess your addiction to your husband and have him have you committed to a chocolate treatment and recovery center!  ;-)

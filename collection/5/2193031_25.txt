DVDs last up to 100 years with care, VHS on the shelf and unused lasts only up to 10 usually. . . Since the signal from a DVD comes from variations detected by laser, there isn't anything touching the surface to wear it out. VHS tapes are touched by the heads and spindles as they play, wearing the tape and it's signals, out.. . DVDs can carry a more detailed signal that VHS tape, giving you better picture and sound quality.. . DVDs take up much less space to store than VHS tapes.. . If you spill liquid on a DVD, you can wash it off in running water, polish gently with a soft cloth and you're good to go. VHS tape is toast if something spills on it.. . If you store VHS tapes near anything magnetic (like a TV screen...), they lose their quality and finally the entire signal. DVDs are impervious to magnetism.

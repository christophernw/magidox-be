Its left a lot of the guys sent to fight there so screwed up its ruined their marriages ,relationship with their kids and an inability to cope in society . That's just one negative effect. That war should have taught us a lot but it obviously hasn't. The guys sent to fight another pointless war in the middle east with end up the same if not worse.

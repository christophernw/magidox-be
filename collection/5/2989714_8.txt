It really depends on the person.  If they harbour strong ideas about inter-racial relationships, they will not appreciate a 'black' man with a 'white' girl.  Also, I have a close friend with this same issue.  The biggest problem she has to contend with is that the 'black' girls refuse to date 'white' men and purposely cause problems for her.  They feel like she is taking one of their men.

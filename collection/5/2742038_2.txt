At the Starbucks near me, the baristas stopped putting the wrap around the cup, but they have them out at the end counter where you go to get the coffee or latte, w/e it is, and you can take one and put it on, but if you use the drive thru, they put them on for you. . . I guess it's just because, if a person took the wrap off, they would want other people near them to see that the drink is from Starbucks.

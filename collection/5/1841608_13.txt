Have you ever looked at a piece of crab grass that has grown out into a crack in the tarmac of a road surface? The crab grass root may grow as long as five or six feet, exactly following the random shape of the crack in the road surface. Pull it out and look at its complex shape. If you read to much bible, you are sure to conclude that because the crab grass shape so perfectly suits the shape of the crack in the road, some "higher power" must have designed the strand of crab grass.. . Darwin's theory certainly accounts for the biological properties of the plants & animals we see around us, but it apparently cannot explain the intellectual shortcomings of many of the creatures that post in this forum!

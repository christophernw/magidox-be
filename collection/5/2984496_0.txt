The bonus screen you spoke about is,I'm fairly sure,the GameBoy Advance Bonuses screen.This will only appear when you have a GBA on the GBA-Gamecube Link cable.Either that,or its the screen that shows after you finish the game.. . As for the "L+Y" before quiting code,try starting a level,then try quiting it after you put in the button code.

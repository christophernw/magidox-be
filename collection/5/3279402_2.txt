Yes.  You need to get the wheels off of the ground, turn the key back to lock the steering wheel.  Put pressure on 3 and 9, back and forth.  Look for play in the steering rack.  More than 1 inch is too much.  It is normal to have a little slack in it.  But you don't want it too sloppy.  But the slack could also be coming from the rack itsself.  If you feel that something is really wrong and you've got way too much slack, I would suggest getting another rack from a junkyard.  Good luck.

yes it effects everyone different i have heard stories like these cub scouts  used the sticks of of a ivy plant to roast hot dogs and it killed a few of them and if you get in the smoke of someone burning it can make you very sick some people are so allergic they cant mow their own yards it depends on the  person i know other people like my dad who have no problem with it all they can rub it all over them and nothing i don't know if they breathed in the fumes of burning plant i think that would hurt them

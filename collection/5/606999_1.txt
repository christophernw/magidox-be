Won't you be mad if you were told that you belonged in the garage and not in the living room or bedroom?. If women belong in the kitchen why do you die to have her in the bedroom?. No body likes to be confined to roles or spaces.. Besides, women belong everywhere that we men belong.. There are no segregations.

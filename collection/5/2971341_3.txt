Some cities and counties have a Public Records section on their websites. If you can find their website, you should be able to see if you can access their public records. Usually you just need to enter a first name and last name, and if there are several different cases against the person, you may need to know the case number, or just go through each one. You can search by your city and look up Municipal Court for misdemeanors and traffic, and Common Pleas Court for the Felonies.

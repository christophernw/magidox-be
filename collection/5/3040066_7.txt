Oh this one is easy haha. It is according to the book of revelation. It is not the devils number or any of that sort, but actually reference to Emperor Nero. Emperor Nero is the beast mentioned in Revelations. Revelation was written by John of Pathmos (there was more than one John) and it pertained to the time that it was written. It is not to be applied to current times. In the Hebrew form of Gematria 666 Spells out NRON KSR (Nero Kaisar or Nero Caesar). . N=50 R=200 O=6 N=50 K=100 S=60 R=200 = 666. . Book of Revelation was written before the collapse of the 2nd Temple in 70 A.D. It was a call for a New Jerusalem. Babylon refers to Rome and the Beast refers to the Emperor.. . It was Evil for Christians, why? Who do you think Nero happened to blame after the fire in Rome? Hehehe. And who do you think had to suffer and be persecuted? The Christians! So obviously, Christians would find this number evil, because it hints a very evil figure. Infact Nero used to use Christians as Garden Lamps in his Gardens (Where the Vatican now stands). He literally lit them on fire! Alive! Thousands of them. They could not openly write any of this because of obvious reasons. Christianity wasnt legalized till 313 AD (Edict of Milan) by Constantine. So anything Christian before that was illegal and you were subject to persecution if you were Christian. So whatever was written before this time was written in secret and using secret allergories and language (like the Hebrew Gematria) so that others would not understand. It was tough being a Christian back then :-p. Revelations was probably written around 68-69 A.D., right before the collapse of the Second Temple in 70.

Chamomile tea is good. Use lavendar in a hot bath and soak for a while before going to bed. Also try and turn off the tv, computer, sterio like a half hour before bedtime, light some candles read a book and just relax. Oh yeah...and warm milk with cinnamon and nutmeg is an oldie but a goodie, so try that too

Of course its selfish but its the same way with countries , football teams and schools . If we like it than it has to be the best or else we wouldn't have chosen it or in the case of religion and countries people are raised to believe they HAVE to show pride . . Pride isnt a bad thing in small amounts it just helps convince us that we made a good choice or are doing the right thing .

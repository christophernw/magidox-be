It's a whole bunch of restaurants and bars in about a quarter-mile stretch through cobbled streets. There are often outdoor musicians, indoor musicians and always plenty of tourists, an easy place to make friends on a grand night out. Also a few live music places and shops as well, definitely a place to visit.

That depends entirely on the individual.  I will answer questions when they are asked, but many won't because they feel they are merely being "set up" for abuse.  Also, I think many who are secular (non-religious) are not in the least antagonistic.  Sadly, those who are get the most press and tend to troll around message boards.  Another person responded to your question with the comment "they worship Satan."  This is patently untrue since Satanism is a religion.  Ergo, those who are are non-religious and guilty of being antagonistic and/or refusing to answer questions cannot - de facto - be Satanists.  I am a secularist and a minister and I will answer any question I am asked if it is done in a decent, non-confrontational manner.  Additionally, I seldom act in an antagonistic manner because I have personally found it to be contrary to enlightening others to new information.

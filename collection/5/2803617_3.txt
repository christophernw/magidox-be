As a former "tardy" student I would simply tell them; if they do not wish to receive a bad grade and not graduate then be tardy all they want. Showing up late does not make it in the real world, and you are preparing them for the real world. Make absentee's and tardy's part of their grade. Don't forget to tell them that their potential employers will be calling for a reference.

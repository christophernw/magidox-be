Between climate change and potential terrorism from another tribe - the anasazi disbanded.  The Hopi claim to be descendents.  They also have legends of a cave/hole that leads to another world inside the Earth - some of the ancestors are said to have returned to 'middle' Earth.. . Most civilizations just disbanded - Anasazi, Olmec, Mayans.  They left the cities to start again in the wilderness.  In a way, it takes real guts to admit that your civilization structure doesn't work and just leave.

I believe in Theistic evolution.. . Further, I have adopted a new scientific theory that we did not evolve from monkeys, but we evolved from seals. The scientific data is there, but pure Creationists are keeping scientists from embracing this theory more <fear of pie on the face; scientists are so prideful>.

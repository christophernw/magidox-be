"we the people" can't get rid of bush because he HASN'T done anything WRONG except make you mad.. Criminal acts deserve impeachment.... . I don't think i'd want to kick bush out of office.... Everything he's being blamed for isn't even his doing.... . Talk to clinton and his administration about whats going on in the middle east...do some research.. . Congress voted for war...not Bush.. Congress can end it...they won't.. . and we are at war with the terrorists only..... . You want change?. . Don't blame Bush...vote for your congressmen and women this fall.... . THEY'RE the ones who REALLY make the final decisions.... . Or didn't you take  your constitution test in school?. . you might want to brush up on that.

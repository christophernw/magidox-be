Because they paint everything in two colors: Black and White. They have a simple message: Outlaw abortion and ban gay marraige and they repeat those two mantras in the right-wing media echo chamber.. . These so-called Christians have forgotten all the things their savior and his dad said. Things like protect the poor and the children (the ones that have been born - Christ never said anything about abortion), turn the other cheek, reject authority, judge not lest ye be judged, vengence is mine, etc. . . Morality doesn't stop at abortion and gay marraige. It doesn't begin there, either.

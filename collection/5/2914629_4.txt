Cats are very versatile and flexible.  The moves won't harm them.  Rather, they may find it stimulating to explore new surroundings.. . My wife's cat has moved several times.  But when he moved here, a house with a yard, he found his favorite place.  Used to be when she would come to visit she would bring MOTH with her (that's his name).  He eagerly got in the car to come here but fought hard not to go home.  I'd say it was good for him.

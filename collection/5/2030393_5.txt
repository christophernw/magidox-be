Tell me, do u as a republican want to pay welfare and child support on that child?  I do not believe in abortion either, but I cannot see collecting support--suppose I can not afford that child.. With all the bad people in the world, there is no way I would consider adoption and worry about the child for all my life............I do that enough for the ones I raised to be grown.

In Brazil and in some spanish-speaking countries as well "gringo" is slang for "foreigner", specifically those coming from Europe, North America or Australia. That means Asians and Africans are not considered "gringos", and neither are the Spanish and the Portuguese, because they speak the same languages as south americans.. . I think it was originally a pejorative word, but now, at least in Brazil, most of the times it's used as normal slang, without a good or a bad connotation. Although of course it also depends on the tone of voice and the context.

Obviously our religion is the best  religion among all other religions in many ways.If we consider our religion to be  the greatest among rest,i don't think that we are being too selfish.. Naturally every person considers the  thing which he has is the best,that does't mean that he is a selfish person.. In many ways our religion is best for e.g a man/women belonging to hindu religion  can marry with one women/man only .. actualy what i am trying to say that if anyone tells that hindu is the best religion than its 100% true and a universal truth.. No one candeny it.. That's all.

Give the dogs a product called "Deter."  This will keep the poop from smelling appealing to the dog that eats the poop, and it is totally healthy.  You may also want to give the dogs a multi-vitamine because sometimes the vets say that when a dog eats its own or another dogs poop, that means that the dog is missing a vitamin in it's diet that it needs.. . Good Luck!

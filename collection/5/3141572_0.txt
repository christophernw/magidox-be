The world isn't getting any better, because there is the god of this world...Satan. Less people are believing the true God and by their own free will, they're letting the adversary be the lord in their lives. Satan has total dominion over this world..he can do what he wants to it, and he wants people to think it's the true God doing it all. As long as you believe Jesus as Lord and that God raised him from the dead, YOU will have dominion over satan, because it will be Christ in you...you will have Christ's seed and holy spirit.

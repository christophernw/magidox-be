Be thankful for the faith full few, being a Christian is not very much in the eyes of those who have not experience the wonderful relationship one walk daily with the Father of all Creation, even she herself moan for the day of the sons of God. Christ is the key and the way to have a perfect and sound relationship with the Father of All. I tell you no lie, there is a witness, a true witness that comes from above, refuse him, . .    Men; you might not understand and be quite confused, but He is the true witness, refuse that invitation not, read the Scriptures for truth not errors and my prayer is that He, Who holds all things together will give you the Spirit of repentance that you also might turn and receive Him gladly

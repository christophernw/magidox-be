Hi I am not a mechanic, but my husband is.. It doesn't hurt it, it just slows you down faster. A good thing to remember when roads are wet!. I  once was glad to be driving a stick shift in very wet conditions! The road were flooded and I was coming down a hill into a Hugh pool of water, and began to slide when I hit the breaks. If I had not recalled my husband telling me to down shift, I would have slide into a big traffic jam.

Looking at the answers so far, and having a PhD in mathematical geophysics (and I even was forced to take a little geology along the way...ugh), I believe that the website I lifted from one of the previous contributors gives the best explanation. . . No one completely knows the contribution of each of these potential sources of the core's heat. One of the biggest mysteries is how much heat is produced by radioactive decay. Presumably any radioactive materials would have sunk to the core because they are denser than most other materials, but the actual quantity of radioactive elements in the core is unknown.

If you want to use the banana while it's frozen, then you have to peel it before you freeze it.  I freeze bananas with the peel on and then thaw them later to use for banana bread and things like that.  Being frozen with the peel on will make the peels turn black when they thaw and the banana will be mushy like it's over-ripe, which is how you want it for bread and cookies and such.

When you talk of God,  I assume you are talking of the Creator of the universe. When you talk of worshipping other gods, it then must refer to the millions of things that we humans have made out to be gods. They are idols.  Worship is an inbuilt nature in us. Due to Sin we are seperated from the true living God. It is only  thru Christ that we can  worship one God, without Him we will continue to worship other Gods

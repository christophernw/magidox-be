To me, it would have been simpler and more polite to simply tell the person "No, I'm not a Christian," and when they pressed you further say "I don't wish to discuss my beliefs with you," and walk off.. . Life is full of people approaching you and questioning you about things you either don't want to talk about or aren't interested in. Although I understand that someone asking about religion is more intrusive and personal than, say -- the credit card offer I wielded off with my sword of debt-free-ness today at a local store -- they're both still unwanted solicitation that is just as easy to politely decline as not.. . I have little patience both for people who persist in "selling" me beliefs after I've made it clear I have no interest nor for people who bristle at the mere mention of the word "beliefs" and use it as an excuse to berate and verbally abuse another. My belief is that -- no matter your religion or lack of -- it's just as easy to be polite in declining a conversation, service or other unwanted advance as it is to be rude.. . I don't believe it's inherently rude to ask someone about their beliefs -- that's part of many Christian religions, spreading the joy to others -- it is rude to pester someone about their beliefs, to not accept that someone does not want a dialogue and to continue to seek one out.. . Just the same way that I don't think it's inherently rude to ask me if I want a credit card, but it is rude to keep calling and calling and calling ... ;).

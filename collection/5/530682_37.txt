It all depends on the religion. I think if you pick a bunch of wiccans, not two of them will agree on anything (the poor forlon phonies they are).. In Christianity and others they're the same, basically.. The thing is people don't usually USE the word "devils" too often. There is A DEVIL and there are DEMONS that serve him. But you only see" devils" in texts when they have said "demons" too much and they need to change it a little.. I think you could say one has a higher rank than the other, it's up to you which one.. Religion--it's full of sh...immering uh crap

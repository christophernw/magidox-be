A knock senor adjusts timing and carbs to eliminate knocks.  If your engine is knocking, you eiher need to up your gasoline grade, or check the timing.. . A knocking engine is actually exploding the gas, rather than just burning it evenly.  If the sensor goes bad, SERIOUS engine damage can occur (like burning up pistons and such)

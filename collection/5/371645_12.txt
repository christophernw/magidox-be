Can't imagine why the coolant could cause the shaking.  If your oil level is normal that shouldn't be it.  . . If the problem started with the change of tires. I would start there. You swap the tires to the back and see if that makes it go away. . . I would also check the lug nuts make sure the wheels are indeed on tight. One wheel could be fluttering. Flutter is an instability and therefore may not be there at all times. . . If you take the wheels and tires out of the equation I would look at the power steering pump.

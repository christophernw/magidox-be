You should sit with the dog and start getting the ticks out of her ears, she's suffering with them in it. Put the ticks in a cup with Clorox (you'll be sure to kill them) and have some tweezers handy so you can reach farther than your fingers can.. After you have them all out give her a bath with Anti Flea shampoo, after she's dry and better get a mix of part water and part white vinegar and with a cotton ball dab inside her ears. She'll be hurting a little bit, but the vinegar also helps her get rid of ear mites, which in combination to ticks could be making her life and ears miserable. The vinegar thing should be done for at least a week.. Hope it works out.

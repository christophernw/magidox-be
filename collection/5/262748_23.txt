Depends on your interperetation of "bad."  For example, in some third world countries, they have religious sacrifices where they sacrifice many animals. To you it might seem they are bad people, but to them, it's their religion. Each individual's interpretation of bad depends on how he was raised. And as George Carlin put it, evil or bad is just a lack of good. A lot of it has to do with morals. To you a person who doesn't go to church may be considered bad, and then in someone else's eyes, a person who parties too much and sleeps with whoever they please may be seen as a bad person. It's not really that they are bad, they are just lost.

The Republicans are not racists, of course... but because being labeled a racist is about the worst thing a person could be labeled here in the U.S., the Democrats spread the word that Republicans are racists, and the mainstream media reports it as fact.. . It's great that you just mentioned Byrd in your question... he just got re-elected again this month for another six year term in the Senate... he's the only member of the Senate who was actually in the KKK... and yes, he's a Democrat... and the Democrats love they guy.. . LBJ actually held up Civil Rights legislation in 1958 while he was Senate majority leader... the main reason being that he wanted to run for President on a "civil rights" platform in 1960... which means that a Democrat will put their own political future first, and to heck with what's best for the country.... . Jim Webb, newly elected Virginia Senator...big time racist, big time Democrat... Jay Rockefeller... the list goes on...

Your comment after your question was funny but oh so true!!!  Women have been asking this question most likely for decades!!  You'd think with a hole that big that they would be able to aim for that!!  I know all about this problem!!  I grew up with a bunch of men and boys in my life!!  Not one of them were successful in their aiming abilities!!  We always had to put down a old towel or two and sometimes paper towels as well.  . . Even back in the days of out houses, men couldn't aim right then!!. . Perhaps a man or two could actually answer your question (if they answer honestly that is...). . Good luck to you and have plenty of old towels and paper towels handy just in case.

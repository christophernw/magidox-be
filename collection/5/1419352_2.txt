A resume is fine... but a portfolio speaks louder than words.  Get together what you can do for a client- your best stuff, and talk to local paint shops...more so, customizing shops.  Is your heart set on cars & trucks? Or are you willing to get into bikes?  There's lots to customize rather than automotive, and a friend recently suggested I do more than just automotive related...as the market is becoming saturated with airbrush artists.. I talk to a lot of strangers (don't tell mom) when I'm out and about, talking about what I do...you'd be surprised the potential business you can turn up just from a conversation.. Check out the Tiki Lounge at Coast's site.... But the portfolio is gonna do it for you, more than anything.

I was wondering the same thing earlier, so I looked up the definition of it on Dictionary.com. It has two defintions for the word agnostic:. . ag·nos·tic    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (g-nstk). n. . . One who believes that it is impossible to know whether there is a God. . One who is skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism. . One who is doubtful or noncommittal about something. . . adj. . Relating to or being an agnostic. . Doubtful or noncommittal: “Though I am agnostic on what terms to use, I have no doubt that human infants come with an enormous ‘acquisitiveness’ for discovering patterns” (William H. Calvin).

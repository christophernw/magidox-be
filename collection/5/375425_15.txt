First you take a right just up the road then take a left at the light don't keep going of you'll miss it then go straight ahead you'll want to stop to go to the restroom but don't, their nasty inside. Then you come to a split of two roads one will say heaven and talk all gibberish about food and drinks  and the other won't say anything, go to the one that doesn't talk it's pure quietness, enjoy!!!

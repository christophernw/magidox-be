iamamidnitoker  is almost right on, except rpm's don't indicate 1 rotation of the crankshaft, but 1 full cycle of the 4 stroke engine. (Intake, Compression, Power, Exhaust) 1 full cycle of all 4 strokes is 1 revolution. Your vehicle could jerk for many reasons. If its a standard trans. letting the clutch out when the engine rpm's are too low, poor fuel delivery to the engine, engine timing out, not good spark to ignite the fuel etc.

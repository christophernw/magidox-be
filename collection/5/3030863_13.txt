I am not British or American but I have to say that I have never met even ONE Brit who is jealous of Americans. Do you really not know how the Brits view you? You were once their colony and they see you as the 'naughty child' - amusing but quite often embarrassing. British tv often pokes fun at Americans and they see themselves as being far superior to you and to the rest of their ex-colonys. It wouldn't occur to them to be jealous of you. As for WWII, if it hadn't been for Pearl Harbour, would Americans have entered the War? I don't know, I'm only asking.

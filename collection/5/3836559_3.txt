I prefer cars. Airplanes get there fast but are so cramped up and stifling. Motorcycles are fun to ride but not for traveling. You can't take your stuff with you. A car can stop anywhere and you can get out, walk around, whatever. Trains are okay, but limited in freedom of movement. After you arrive, you still don't have a car.

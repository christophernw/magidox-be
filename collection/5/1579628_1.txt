pulpitis is what makes your tooth hurt.  the nerve in the center of the tooth becomes irritated and since it is encased in the solid tissue of the tooth, there is nowhere for it to swell.  that causes pain!. . pulpitis is usually irreversible and requires a root canal or extraction.  remove the nerve or remove the tooth and the pain will quit.  the better move is obviously to remove the nerve and keep the tooth.

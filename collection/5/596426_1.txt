games let us do things that we can't do in life, or sort of give us a lil peek. Like the PS2 game called Kingdom Hearts 2. That game gives us a vision of what would happen if this will happen, and, of course, we can't do those sort of things such as magic spells, high jumps, sword skills, transformation, etc. Not only is it for fiction, but for non-fiction also. Games can give us a vision of what troops do in battle, or what wrestlers do in WWE, or how to take care of families, pets, and more.

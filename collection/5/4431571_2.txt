Get a crate that is the right size for your puppy, this is it's safe place, be sure to take it out after he/she eats/drinks, plays and wakes up.  Also be sure to praise him/her every time that they "do their duty" as we call it.  If you do this, it shouldn't be too long till your puppy is trained.  Good Luck

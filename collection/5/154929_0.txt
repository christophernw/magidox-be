Depends on renal function and the original input of fluid the patient is having. Including IV Fluids aswell as diet with fluids. It is not an easy question to answer. Ideally though, as  a nurse or doctor..you aim to have a minimal 30 mls an hour output..that is when the patient has a catheter and we are measuring it hourly. Anything below this is not acceptable.

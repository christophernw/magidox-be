Yes. Remedies are supposed to help you. If you don't feel any less anxious then perhaps the remedies are not working, or if they are "working" they are not working correctly. It is probably best if you go see a doctor (preferably the doctor who prescribed those pills for you, if you got those remedies from prescription). If you are stressed, it is probably best that you take a break and rest and relax, maybe take a vacation. I hope you feel better!

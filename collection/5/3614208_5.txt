I think you should buy or make her a hutch so that she's more secure. Alternately, you should bring her inside and make her an indoors bunny. If she's free in the garden constantly, she's also not very safe - because she's at risk of being attacked by predators like birds of prey, owls, cats, foxes. Also, if you keep your bunn indoors with you, she'll really become attached to you. Anyway, have a read of these sites' recommendations for cage sizes and security -. http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/rabbits/a/rabbithomes.htm. http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/rabbits/a/rabbitcageidea.htm. http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/housing.html. http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/rabbit-proofing.html. http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/outdoors.html. http://www.rabbit.org/journal/4-4/pen-living.html. http://www.rabbit.org/journal/1/cage-manufacturers.html. http://www.rabbit.org/care/living-with-a-house-rabbit.html. http://au.geocities.com/leaswebsite/bunnyhouserabbits.html - my site - have a read and hope it's very helpful!

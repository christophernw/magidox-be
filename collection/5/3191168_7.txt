It only scares me in regard to knowing that I won't be there for my loved ones. I am confident that I'm going to be with God, so why worry?. . Think of it this way- every person who has ever lived before now, has gone through it. It is natural. No matter what you believe, there's nothing to worry about, as long as you live your life in the best way you know how. Be true to yourself, and don't compromise your beliefs. Whether your time is up very soon, or if you have half a century or more ahead of you, just live without regret, and you won't fear death.

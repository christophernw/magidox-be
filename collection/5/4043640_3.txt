I can understand the feeling people get while losing a special friendship or loved one... but i am not that sentimental. I am a believer that life goes on, no matter what! On with the show, you know? Im very independent, and although i love a lot of people, i know ill carry on just fine! I dont know what to say, just stop being so sentimental... i know its not a matter of stoping, thats how you are, and i understand. But life goes on and you still have to make the best out of it! If not, then you may be wasting your time!

Butter is made from cream, margarine is hydrogenated vegetable oil. Hydrogenation adds an extra hydrogen atom to the oil, which causes it to thicken, the process turns it black, it is then bleached to be white and then colouring is added to it so that it looks like butter! This procedure is obviously unhealthy, there are certain brands of margarine that are unhydrogenated, that for years we thought were better for you then butter or hydrogenated oils, however it turns out that the process that solidifies the oil is actually worse for you then the hydrogenation process. Hope this answers your question!

Who says I want to let "you" get weed out of "my" system?. . Unless you meant to ask how "you" can get weed out of "your" system? . . I have to wonder if you should just quit smoking it all together, 'cause I think you fried your brain if you think you can get it out of someone else's system for them. lol. . Seriously though...if you go to a "head-shop" and ask them for a drink called "Detoxify", and follow the directions thoroughly, and to the letter, it will work perfectly. I know, because I've used it myself before, and it worked when I had to test for a job at Mervyn's. Good luck.. . P.S.- Niacin from GNC will work as well. It will make your skin red and hot and you will itch like mad...but it works. Just don't scratch because it actually makes the itching 50% worse than if you just ride it out.

Actually, in some of the stories in TREK fanzines, there are cats on the Enterprise.... . Conversely, though they were never seen on any of the episodes, that may just reflect the fact that they weren't relevant to the plot line.  There may well have been cats on the Enterprise, and we just didn't see 'em.. . In fine: because none of the plots needed a cat on the Enterprise, that's why.

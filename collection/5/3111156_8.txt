I had the same problem. You may need to settle for a house rather than an apartment. I called a radio station, they put me on air & I put forward my plight to the listening public. It worked! I had numerous responses forwarded to the station & ended up having 3 houses to choose from! I also have excellent references for both myself and my dogs. It may sound weird but do a C.V. for your dog - much the same as you would do for yourself for a job. Include name, age, temperament, health, vaccinations etc... When filling out applications for homes include your references and your dogs' C.V.. . Good luck!!!!

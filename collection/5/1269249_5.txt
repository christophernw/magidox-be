It will take awhile to adjust, but you certainly can live with aids.  There are great drugs out there that will give you the ability to live a full life.. . I don't know how to help you with all the pain.  I'm sorry you have to go through that.  It is important for you to find some one or a group to share and talk with.  Talking with others who are going through a lot of the same physical and emotional pains, can be a great comfort.  Don't try to take this on by yourself, and don't blame yourself.

A lot of times, the majority of the work seems to be "dumped" on others in the group. Also, when working with a group, it can be difficult to have your voice be heard, and you may end up doing something that you really would not like to do.  . However, it's a lot of fun if everything works out. You can meet new people, have a good reason to hang out with friends after school, or get an awesome grade because of equally hardworkers in the group. Usually, someone in the group needs to step up and be willing to play the role of the leader and to make sure stuff gets done. If there is no leader, members of the group may think that things are being left undone by other people, but not have anyone to ask for help with the problem. . I am in college now, and like group work a lot more than I used to. In middle school and high school, people seem to be too insecure to take advantage of the positive opportunity that group work offers them.

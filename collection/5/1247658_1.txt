Like any other program you need to open the torrent from the program unless you have it set up so all you have to do is click on the download torrent link and it should open your client. Unless you mean what to do with the files once they are downloaded, that would depend on the type of file it is.  Most common is a .rar file in that case you would use winrar. Here's a broad search engine for every torrent out there. check it out: http://torrent-finder.com/

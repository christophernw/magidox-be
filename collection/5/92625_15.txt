It is a war for profit, not just for the oil companies but for defense contractors as well.  The current administration and many leaders of both parties are heavily influenced by these industries.  As for the gas prices, have you ever heard of the words Monopoly or Collusion?  Big oil conspires to squash any competetion, that is collusion.  It helps to maintain their monopoly on the world's supply of this critical resource.  Just look at all the negative propaganda concerning Venezuela and their nationalized oil industry.   The big oil companies can charge whatever they want because we need their product and we don't have any options for obtaining it other than the big oil companies.  I'd say that gives them a monopoly.

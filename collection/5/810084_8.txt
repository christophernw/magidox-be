In the previous Biology classes I have taken, I was told that the hairs in your nose are there to catch debris and other airborne things before they reach your lungs. These hairs are extremely sensitive and so when they are disturbed, they cause your nose to have that funny feeling and then you sneeze. Also, notice that you don't sneeze when you are sleeping? Sneezing is an voluntary movement of your body and therefore when you are sleeping your nose hairs are as affected as when you are awake . Your heart does actually stop for a second and that is why people coined the phrase "bless you"

Being a Jew is having a connection to ancient history. And they sure have paid a high price for their allegiance to their heritage. Most of us would sell out our ancestors far more cheaply. Historically, the region that was known as Palestine during modern times was the land where the nation had a temple for worship and had occupied for hundreds of years (thousands?) until the latter part of the Roman empire. Even the moslem religion is taken from the religion of Abraham. So, in a real sense, the culture, religion and history that bind that place together has roots much deeper than anything else on earth. . . How hard is that to grasp?

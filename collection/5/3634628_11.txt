I am a Bahai, and I stongly believe in it.. My parents are Bahai too, but it is not the reason that I am a Babai. No one born Bahai, even though your family are Bahai you have to do yoru home work seach for truth and chose what ever is good for you, that is why I believe in it as I did my homework and I found out for myself.. It is base on equality of men and  woman, it says if a father has money to spenf of one of his kids wducation and he has a boy and girl he has to spend it for the girl.. It is base on unity and world peace, I do not believe in borders and I am ( as all Bahi's ) citizen of the world.. and basicly:. The Baha'i Faith is the youngest of the world's independent religions. It is based on the teachings of Baha'u'llah (1817-1892), Who is regarded by Baha'is as the most recent in a line of Messengers of God that includes Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Christ, and Muhammad. . . Baha'u'llah taught that there is only one God and one human family, that all religions represent progressive stages in the revelation of God's Will, and that humanity is reaching its long-awaited stage of maturity, when a peaceful and just world order can finally be realized. . . While restating the ethical and spiritual principles common to all religions, Baha'u'llah revealed new social principles and laws to lay the foundation of a global civilization. We invite everyone, regardless of race, religion or ethnicity, to study, worship and work with us to bring into reality the vision of humanity as one global family and the earth as one home.

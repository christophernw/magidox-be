when working with the public at one of my numerous 'joe jobs' i was asked by an elderly woman if i was a 'man' or a 'woman'.. . i have a deep voice, at the time i had hair down past my shoulders and a full beard.. . when i said in an irritated deeper voice "I'm a man", she replied that she couldn't tell because of the 'long hair'.. nevermind the beard the deep voice, the lack of boobs or hips-----she just had to get her dig in about the long hair.  what a moron.

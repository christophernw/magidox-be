Muslims are trying to inform people about the true image of Islam. But, the thing is that, people are not all the same. A lot of people know that Islam is a great religion which has no place for terrorism but they just don't want to accept it. At the same time, a lot of people, not Muslims, after knowing about Islam, are fighting against the propaganda unleashed against Islam. So, infact, it's individuals' choice to accept or deny the truth.

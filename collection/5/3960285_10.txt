They use them because consumerist life is so boring and meaningless. As Aldous Huxley pointed out, all cultures use some kind of drugs for philosophical, religious or recreational purposes. Jesus used wine. Western cultures use, alcohol tobacco, antidepressants, tranquilisers, stimulants, painkillers, mood elevators, diet pills, ADD medications etc for similar reasons. I personally consider Cannabis (marijuana) a sacrament and creative tool.

In homosexuals it has been scientifically proven that there are chemical imbalances in the estrogen levels in men and testosterone levels in women. I know, what men have estrogen and women have testosterone? Well everybody has a certain percentage of the opposite sex's hormone. Some bodies were just born with an imbalance of hormones, hence a man having an extra percent of estrogen or a woman having an extra percent of testosterone.

Eggs - The egg is an ancient symbol of new life breaking forth. It symbolizes spring's return, new life and the Resurrection. Why do we color Easter Eggs? According to one legend, some eggs were colored when Mary's (Jesus' mother) tears fell on them. It became customary to decorate eggs to symbolize the end of the penitential season, the beginning of springtime and renewal of life. The eggshell reminded early Christians of the sealed tomb. Why do we use so many eggs at Easter? A long time ago during the long weeks of Lent, people were not supposed to eat meat or animal products so they couldn't eat eggs, but the hens kept laying them. There were plenty of eggs to be used up once Easter arrived! People decorated them and gave them as presents.

Because a college degree is about more than experience.  Not only do a large portion of today's college grads have hands-on experience by the time they graduate, but a college degree says something about your genuine interest in the field.  Most importantly, however, it shows that an applicant can pick up new information easily and is responsible enough to get the necessary work done (4 years of successful college work).  Like you, I realize that this is a generalization and there are exceptions, but these are the assumptions that follow you when you have a college degree.  Furthermore, depending on the school an applicant graduated from, employers often recognize the rigorous application process that the school put them through- often, people "assume you're smart" because you got into (fill-in college here). Finally, most fields are evolving and changing with the times and with technology, and a recent college graduate, while less experienced than a veteran of the field, has been able (and in many times required) to look at all of those new changes far more recently, therefore becoming better able to help the company keep up with the times.

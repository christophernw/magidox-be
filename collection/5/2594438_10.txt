Your body sounds completely normal to me. 115 pounds is within the "normal" weight range for your height (it's down at the lower end of "normal," but it doesn't put you in the underweight category at all).  If you're unhappy with the way your body looks, I'd suggest that you see a counselor to talk about body image issues.  If you don't exercise regularly, you might also start trying to add some daily exercise into your routine -- this may help increase your appreciation for how healthy and strong your body truly is.

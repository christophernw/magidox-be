The sympathetic nervous system, one half of the Autonomic nervouse system, controls ejaculation in men thru seratonin a neurotransmitter that has a key affect on peristalsis. SSRI inhibit the reuptake of this from the synaptic cleft.This can cause a premature ejaculation,the reason it may cause a delayed ejaculation or anorgasmia is that since seratonin is not being replenished back across the synaptic cleft  the membrane potentiala may not be repolarizing, but this is just a somewhat educated geuss, I would like to see if any one else can clear this up a little more.

I think the legal term is 'causing a nuisance'.. It doesn't take much imagination for any law officer to realise that the smell is a nuisance.. . But can't you talk to the neighbour. How long does he plan on keeping the pigs? What is his reason for having them?. If you get really peed off, just get half a dozen cows.

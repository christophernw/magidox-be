Because he promised Malfoy's mother he would protect him. And Malfoy couldn't bring himself to kill Dumbledore, which was going against  Voldemort's orders. So, Voldemort would have probably killed Malfoy. Plus, they always said Harry would live as long as Dumbledore was around, and J.K has said in the book she's writting now, Harry is going to die, because he is getting to old. So it all comes together.

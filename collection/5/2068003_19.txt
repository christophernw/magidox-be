You can try putting peanut butter in a tall container or bucket that they can't jump out of or even by putting peanut butter in a minnow trap if you have one. You can also buy "live trap" mouse trap at a hardware store, get a metal one because they'll just chew through a plastic "live trap".  Good luck with the mice.

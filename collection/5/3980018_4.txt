Well the scar is there probably forever. You can either take L-Lysine; it is a vitamin that you can buy at a drug store or grocery store, it helps your body fight back the cold sore virus. Or you can go to the doctor when you get another cold sore and they can prescribe you medicine that you take when you get a break out. It is almost like herpes virus once you have it you can always have break outs.

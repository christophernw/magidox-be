YOU NEED TO INCREASE YOUR INTAKE OF FIBRE WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE HEALTH OF THE BOWEL. FIBRE CAN BE FOUND IN FRUIT, VEGETABLES (ESPECIALLY THE GREEN ONES, LIKE SPINACH, BROCCOLI ETC), BROWN BREAD, BROWN RICE AND ALSO IN NUTS AND SEEDS. IT IS ALSO A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE DRINKING AT LEAST 1-2 LITRES OF WATER EVERY DAY. NOT ONLY DOES IT ELIMINATE CONSTIPATION, IT ALSO FLUSHES THE TOXINS FROM THE BODY AND LEAVES YOU WITH GLOWING SKIN.

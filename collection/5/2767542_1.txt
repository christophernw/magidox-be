The top layer of your skin is just dead, protenized cells.  It is important in protecting you from all kinds of things (UV, bacteria, see above answers).  Because this tissue is dead, the substances that hold it onto your body degenerate and eventually it loses its ability to hold the cells on, so they fall off.  This helps get rid of dirt and germs.

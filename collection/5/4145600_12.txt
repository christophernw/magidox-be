All cures-healings are forms of treatment, but not all treatments are cures.  Cures are supposedly permanently end a condition whether we know the treatment or cause of healing or not.  The body ITSELF treats diseases for us constantly by thousands of homeostasis mechanisms it utilizes dynamically and constantly, so our body-cells-tissues-organs is-are our own physician in some instances, and our body dispenses huge numbers of chemicals-drugs for us.  IF body can't do it alone, we may seek help from various forms of help out there, from traditional allopathic AMA type medicne or surgery to currently less traditional "holistic treatments," including folk medicine, home remedies or faith healings.  Treatments can help alleviate the symptoms, but may NOT get rid of a condition.  Diseases can be infectious and non-infectious, chronic, acute, genetic, non-genetic. Thus "treatment" is a very general word and might just mean something as simple as "take an asprin and drink water and take bedrest" or might be treated with complex plan or strategy using many chemical, surgical, energetic modalities.

I wish I knew how to CCP but here is the best thing for you to do....Google it....if you don't have google as your browser download it....then type in Black Holes in your search bar and a whole bunch of sites with all of this information and then some will come up on black holes....try it....you'll love it....it's amazing...in short a star or a sun becomes a red giant or something like that and then it's own weight and gravity cause it to cave in on itself and then it collapses and becomes a black hole....that's the short crappy incorrect version....now go look it up on the internet

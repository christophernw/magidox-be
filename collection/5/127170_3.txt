The jealousy you speak of is different from ours.. . He created man so that man would worship him.  Man has free will to do or worship whater he wants.  however the jealousy is for example, at church:. . You go to church to worship God, not to think about the football , basketball, soccer, or hockey game.  You don't go to church because there is a church member you would really like to get to know.  That is the Jealousy that God has towards man.. . If I invite you to my house, and all you do is think about something else while you are there, or you are not there to visit me, but because some one else will be there, then I would feel neglected. hence i would be jealous of you having your attention towards something else.  Although I would not be able to read your mind of your purpose, GOD CAN.. . God Bless

A caul is a thin, filmy membrane, the remnants of the amniotic sac, that covers or partly covers the newborn mammal immediately after birth. It is also the membrane enclosing the paunch of mammals, particularly as in pork and mutton butchery. But being born with this doesn't mean you can never drown. All people can drown if inhaling sufficient amounts of fluid that don't provide the necessary oxygen exchange.

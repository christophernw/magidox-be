I am always in search of that last book to read so as to feel, there is nothing to learn further. . 2. I read just for time pass. . 3. I read to criticize. 4. I read to be in society as a knowledgeable idiot. 5. I read to get some tips for my professional improvement. 6. I read to get a certificicate.. . So, now you know the answer is not specific. It depends on what you read, when you read what for you read. I, you and all read for different reasons at different point of time. . . All the best for your forthcoming speech.

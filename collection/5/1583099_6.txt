Is this a serious question? Israel has been an ally of the US since its birth; Palestine has long been a breeding ground for dissent and violent extremists. Some say that a terrorist is a freedom fighter depending on what side you are on, and I won't get into that debate; but you must question the motives of tose who use fear and terror to get their point across...civil disobedience cowed the British Empire, and ended segregation in the US...do innocent people have to die to prove a point?

Try hot ginger compress. Make a hot ginger tea soak the  towel in it, wring it and put it on the pain to decongest your sinus. (make sure its not too hot to burn you)  Do this throughout the day until pain subsides. Douche sinus with fresh aloe vera gel, inhale small amount, first one nose then the other side. I do mine at night to wake up with a clear sinus.  (You must be careful not to do this alot or use alot of aloe, it may cause stomache problems) When you have pain stay away from salt, sugar and junk food, this contributes to more inflammation. (Mucus feeds on this stuff)  NOTE: never mix herbs or vitamins with over the counter medication or prescribe medication!. Hope to your health!

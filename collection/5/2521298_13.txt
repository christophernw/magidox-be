I have seriously considered the tongues issue, checking references in Scripture, and found that the Spirit decides when and to whom He gives this gift. On Pentecost the gift was given to preach Jesus in known tongues. The word "unknown" in 1 Cor. 14 was added by the translators as indicated in the KJV. Speaking in tongues was not always present with the gift of the Spirit.

Oh my goodness.. I can't for the life of me figure out why everyone beats down why the government and cops do when it could have been so easily avoided by what others do... here's what happened because you actually have not educated yourself...Former people that were in the cult went to authorities and asked for their help... they claimed that David Kersh was practicing Polygamy with underage girls and had stock piles of weapons....The FBI investigated and David Kersh and his followers would NOT cooperate... so it escalated the way that it did- if they were doing nothing wrong than they should have cooperated.. they didn't .. it was their fault not the governments, not the FBI, nobody but them

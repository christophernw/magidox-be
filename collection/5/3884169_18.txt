I can talk about the Sunday thing. You shouldn't go on a Sunday. The Bible says to keep the Sabbath day holy, and that the seventh day is the Sabbath, and, therefore, in it, one should not do any work. Furthermore, the idea that Jesus rose on a Sunday is also flawed. He couldn't have died on a Friday evening and risen on a Sunday morning, because that's not three days. Daniel 8:27 says that, in the midst of the week, he'd cause sacrifice and oblations to cease in the temple. He did so with his death because, after his death, there was a great earthquake that rent the veil in the temple in two, showing that the temple was no longer necessary and that sacrifices would no longer have to be offered. He died on a Wednesday, because it says that he'd do so in the midst of the week. Therefore, he was resurrected upon a Saturday.

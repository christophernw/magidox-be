First, suspend 2 test tubes full of water upside-down in a beaker filled with water (be careful not to let any air get in the test tube). Second, put a copper wire into each test tube and have it run over the side of the beaker (make sure the copper wire doesn't touch the bottom of the beaker). Finally, attach one copper wire to the positive side of a 9-volt battery and the other wire to the negative side and let it sit overnight. The test tube that has the most gas is the one with hydrogen gas and the other one has oxygen gas.

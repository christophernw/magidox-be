You might have sleep apnea.  Various things can cause it.  Do you snore?  Do you have a pain in your legs when you wake up? (Caused by random leg jerks, a symptom of apnea)  You need to see a doctor or even a clinician about this.  If it is apnea it is easily remedied with a small oxygen machine or machine designed to move air.  It could be something more serious however.

So the truth is every soldier, sailor, marine, airman and coast guardsman is ignorant?  Do you have the courage to tell that to Wesley Clark, a fellow liberal and veteran?  How about Colin Powell, John McCain, ben NightHorse Campbell, the Former Democratic representative from Hawaii who lost his arm in WWII fighting for the US, Former GOV and SEN Kerry from NE, a DEM who was awarded the Medal of Honor for service in Viet Nam and how about the courage to walk into any USMC recruiting station today and espouse your opinion about the military being ignorant? . . You like all other liberals hide on Yahoo Q & A to voice your mealy mouthe opinions but never provide solutions.  Grow a pair or shut the f*** up.

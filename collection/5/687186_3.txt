Have to agree with "Hair of the Dog"!  As hard as it might be have one of whatever gave you the hangover in the first place.  After that have one more but eat something hearty and greasy while drinking it.  Trust me!!! Bartending for 18+ years and it is a sure cure.  Unless you can stomach bloody mary's - then make sure it is spicy and GOOD VODKA!  Otherwise I go with the "Hair"

I agree with Dazed, except about medications. There are many medications; and everyone has their own unique experience with them because our bodies are all different due to genetics, etc.. . . I have a good deal of experience in this field, and don't know of any non-prescription drugs or herbs that work for anxiety. A big problem with herbal remedies is that they are not regulated and don't have to prove that they actually do what they claim to do. But I do know that there are prescription drugs that can help with anxiety. . . Many times, though, anxiety is more about stressors that people have in their lives that cause them worry. So maybe her advice about getting counseling would be the best place to start. A counselor can help you identify what's causing the anxiety and support you in getting the help that you need. Sometimes just talking with a professional can help reduce stress and anxiety.

i think efficiency is expressed as ratio of power inputed/power outputed. . ie if the compressor was rated at 800w( uses 800w) and gave out 800w in useable power then its efficiency is said to be 1/1 or 1, but no machine is that efficient, due to heat , vibration and friction etc.. . if the compressor was rated at 800w and gave out 200w of usable energy it would be an efficiency of 1/4 or 0.5

An object appears to be reflected as if there were a pool of water on the ground. This phenomenon is caused by light refraction {bending of light beams}. Light bends when it passes from one medium into another -- from air to water, for example, or even from colder air to warmer air. This may seem like a strange idea, but it's really very simple.

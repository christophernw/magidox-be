Try to strike up conversation at work with people, even if you don't think you have anything in common with them.  You never know what anyone is really like, and people who don't know you will take shyness as being aloof.  Be sure to make plenty of phone calls and write letters to those who you do know, no matter how far.  Explore and enjoy your new surroundings, and sooner than you think, they won't be so foreign and looming.

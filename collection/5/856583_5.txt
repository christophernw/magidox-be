I'm afraid there is not much you can do.  A lease is a contract between you and the landlord so all you can really do is go to him and explain your reduced circumstances.  He may be decent and let you out of the lease.  Another option would be if you could find someone to sub-lease the apartment.  Your landlord may be willing to let you out of the lease if you have already gone to the trouble of finding someone else to lease the apartment.  If you do go this route be sure to check the other persons finances and get references.  I would also draw up a contract about the rent and when it is due.  Because, unfortunately people will run out on a sublease and leave the original renter in a real bind.  This way if you have a contract you can sue them if they do this to you.  Good luck I'm afraid you will need it.

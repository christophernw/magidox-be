B"H. We're not supposed to use Yahoo Answers as a messaging bord or for chat.  Read the terms of agreement you signed to use this thing.. . If you really want to make a comment to someone, you can do so after you pick a best answer.  Maybe they'll read it, maybe they won't.. . The point is, we don't want this place to get littered with drama and conversation - it's supposed to be a resource for information; Yahoo has many other forums designed for conversation that you can check out if you'd likel.

People have different abilities. Teachers are responsible for recognising that. Ok so the students get a D, it isn't the end of the world... that was about my average in school, and granted at 21 im still studying but this is not a negative thing as I believe im just building a foundation and getting a thorough understanding of the world before i really enter it. I remember these words from my childhood "if at first you don't succeed try and try again" it doesn't matter how long it takes, you should tell students in this sitution that it is ok and they should take their time, after all the snail once the race not the hare.

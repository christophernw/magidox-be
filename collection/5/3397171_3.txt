Depends on the drug.  All drugs are excreted from the body in one way or another - some through the kidneys, some through exhalation (like alcohol, to a degree, which explains how a breathalyzer works), and some like methamphetamine are excreted through the skin.  This is why chronic meth users commonly have small ulcers (sores) on their skin.  As the drug is excreted it actually damages the tissue.

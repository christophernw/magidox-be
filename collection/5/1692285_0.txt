hey..thanks for the answer to my question! as far as yours goes, thats totally creepy, and has happened to me before, except the guy wasnt taking pictures...if i were you, id email him a warning, telling him that he's creeping you out, and to back off or else you'll call the cops. and if he doesnt stop, well, id go from there and call the police. how weird!

Well if you are dogmatic you think that your answers are automaticaly right. It really depends on the situation. For eg:Someone is religious and they obviously believe in a god but you dont. There is no proof of either so no matter what until there is proof there is no right answer where as if someone was wanting to debate the fact that the world is not flat and someone disagrees obviously there is a right answer. It all depends on the situation and what the opinion is. Everyone should be able to share their opinion, right or wrong.

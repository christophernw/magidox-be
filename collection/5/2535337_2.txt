I think it's mostly habit or tradition.  People get asked if they still want it and they say yes, that they like the long summer evenings.  I don't think it adds anything to the summer by having sunset later, because the morning just starts later, and for early risers that isn't great, either. I think if one part of the country does it, the rest do it, because things get mixed up otherwise.  we in Canada do it because the USA does, and we don't want to be out of sync, or so I've heard. I wish we'd stay with Standard time all year.

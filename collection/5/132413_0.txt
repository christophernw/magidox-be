Someone who makes mistakes when talking especially relevant with actors who get their lines wrong or stutter when delivering them. This is known as fluffing. Also widespread use of un-necessary and irrelevant fillers when talking so as to make the sentences sound more impressive. Fluffers will use 'er' and 'um' a lot and those without confidence will fill their sentences with phrases like 'you know','actua(ly)', 'basically', 'you know what I mean', 'do you understand me', 'like', 'sort of' and so on.. . Examples :. . Actors : 'To be or, er, not to be. That is the, um, the question.'. . Speakers: "I was wondering ,like, if basically you'd actually, sort of, er, come out with me, you know what I mean?" ("I was wondering if you'd come out with me?")

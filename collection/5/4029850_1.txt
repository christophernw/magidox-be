If the running nose is an everyday affair, it could be due to weakness of drainage in the nostrils. Try giving them very small doses of antihistamine(the medication normally doctors prescribed for cold), just a quarter  every morning night before bedtime, it can help stop the dripping of fluid from the nose. I understnad that taking raw garlic seems to be a good help for running nose too and its good for cardiac and cholestrol health too.

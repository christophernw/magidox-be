your alternator might be in trouble, or if the air conditioner is run off the serpentine belt it might need to be replaced. . . Maybe the water pump? I know when iam low on antifreeze my truck has some issues with chugging because the heat gauge goes up and it thinks it needs to shut off to save the engine or something.

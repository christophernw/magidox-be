Someone has already hit the nail on the head. It's not hot water that cools quicker but water that has been pre-boiled.. . The boiling process removes some of the mineral content of the water as these tend to precipitate (e.g., Calcium carbonate forming limescale). . This raises the freezing temperature of the water closer to zero. Without boiling, the mineral content of the water actually means that the temperature must be reduced below zero to get ice forming. . . TI expect the difference is minimal but in areas with high mineral content in their water it may be more pronounced.

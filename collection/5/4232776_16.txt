Well, if you can prove that you lived someplace all your life, and it belonged to your ancestors for centuries, and when it was overrun with conquerors and they drove your ancestors out, it wasn't voluntary, and you would like your land back, how would it stand up in a court of law?  Especially if you could prove that your ancestors (who are themselves all dead) killed off all of the previous occupants when they first came upon the scene, and since these previous occupants left no descendants, there is no one left to challenge your claim to the land?  And suppose that wherever your people went to escape oppression, someone always wanted to kill them, or enslave them, or continue to oppress them somehow, so that when you got your land back, you and your people could be left alone to remake your own lives and be left to yourselves to re-form your own culture and your own government.  And suppose any interim occupiers were given the choice of staying and living in a democracy, or of leaving, a choice your ancestors were not given, how would that stand up in a court of law?

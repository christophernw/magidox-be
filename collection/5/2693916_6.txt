Well - you are probably mostly pissed at yourself and reflecting that on how you view the world.  You can always find someone and something to be pissed off at so I don't think that those things are the issues. You should also quit living by your emotions and look within yourself to be happy and content with your own life and screw everyone else, some people may say this is selfish - but in reality you will find if you are happy with yourself - you will find joy in others....Good Luck!

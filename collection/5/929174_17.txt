You have to just learn to allow others to have their beliefs. You don't have to understand their beliefs or agree with them but you have to allow them their space to worship in their own way. It's interesting that religious leaders can get together and sit down so they can openly discuss their beliefs and opinions on how to make the world a better place but the followers of these religions feel the need to fight for their religion to be the best. Religion is suppose to be about God not fighting one another.. Love & Light. One Planet = One People

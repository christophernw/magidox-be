The effervescence of bubbly beverages—including soda, beer, and champagne—comes from dissolved carbon dioxide. These beverages are bottled (or canned) under pressure, which increases the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide. When the container is opened, the pressure is released. Bubbles of gas form as the system returns to equilibrium. Molecules of dissolved carbon dioxide are initially dispersed evenly throughout the liquid. Once the pressure of the bottled-up system is released, however, gas molecules migrate to certain spots and coalesce there to form bubbles. These are much more likely to arise on the bottom or sides of the glass than within the liquid because bubbles form preferentially at surface imperfections, spots where the glass is pitted, scratched, or etched. Such locations are called sites of nucleation. Once bubbles begin to form, they attract other carbon dioxide molecules until the bubble grows so large that buoyancy causes it to break off and rise. The aggregation of carbon dioxide at those nucleation sites continues until the system reaches equilibrium—that is, the drink becomes "flat." Sites of nucleation also initiate the formation of crystals in a solution, such as sugar crystals in honey or maple syrup, and the formation of raindrops in clouds.

In addition to the other reasons:. . 1 - Did you ever see a windbreaker that had been stored for a long period of time without use?  It's stiff.  The parachute won't deploy.. . 2 - You could hit the wing, get sucked into the . jet/propeller.. . 3 - If you open the hatch, it will suck the other passengers out before they're ready - in addition to depressurizing the plane and rendering them unconscious.. . 4 - So many people rushing towards the exit will all jump at once and become tangled in each other's parachutes.. . 5 - Rescue is difficult if the group is spread out, which they would have to be in order to depart the aircraft at such high speeds (without stalling) safely.

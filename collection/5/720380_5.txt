An optical telescope can see the light being emitted from stars.  If these stars are say 50,000 LYs away, then it takes the light 50,000 years to reach us.  So, in that sense we can see what happened to that star 50,000 years ago.  It is possible that the stars you can see in the sky don't actually exist any more, but it's just taking the light such a long time to reach us, that we don't know about it yet.. . A radio telescope can detect different wavelengths of radiation.  It is through this that we can see what is known as the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR).  It is from the radiation at a time of about 300,000 years after the Big Bang (around 15 billion years ago).  it is possible to see this because when the Universe first exploded from the Big Bang, it expanded at a speed that was many thousands of times greater than the speed of light.  The radiation from the Big Bang is still travelling across the Universe, and that is what we can detect.. . Hope that helps

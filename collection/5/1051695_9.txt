Night Owl Syndrome. http://sleepdisorders.about.com/cs/dsps/a/nightowl.htm. . DELAYED SLEEP PHASE SYNDROME (DSPS) . Perhaps the most common of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders is Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS), which occurs mainly in teenagers and young adults. It occurs when a person's body clock is running later than it should, resulting in sleep-onset and wakening times that are very late in relation to the daily cycle of life. It is at the extreme end of the 'night owl' syndrome: a night owl will typically choose to stay up until midnight, and sleep until 8 in the morning; a person with DSPS is unable to initiate sleep until well after 1 or 2 am, and has extreme difficulty awakening until late morning or close to noon.. . http://www.sunbox.com/Research/SCRD.asp

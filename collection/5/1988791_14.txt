It will pass. But it's part of a cycle that will probably not end...as soon as things smooth out, more conflicts arrive. More  troubles and conflicts are all lined up, down around the corner, up the street and through the hills...all waiting their turn to knock on your door. That's not pessimism...it's reality, and it helps to know that's the way it is with everyone. But also in line are accomplishments, joy, love and good feelings and good relationships. Just don't get bummed, or be so surprised, when conflicts show up. Conflicting feelings will always be a part of life, and when they do, you're going to get "that feeling" all over again. But it will pass.

SF is cold and windy in the summer because  of the cold water along the coast and the Northwesterly winds produced by the Pacific High. As these high-moisture content moving winds approach the coast, they come in contact with the colded, upwelling waters and cool off producing water dropplets which then become fog as the wind continue to blow the air into the coast. This type of fog is termed advection fog.. In late September and October, SF records the highest temperatures values because of the migration of the Pacific High southward reducing the wind's strength along the coast and decreasing temperature differences between land and sea. It takes longer for the Pacific to warm up thus producing a lag in the warming process along the Bay Area.

Because of their high price and their pungent taste, truffles are used sparingly. Paper-thin truffle slices may be inserted in meats, under the skins of roasted fowl, in foie gras preparations, in pâtés, or in stuffings. Truffle infused oil is an economical and popular way to enjoy their flavor.. . The flavor of black truffles can be compared to Gorgonzola cheese, but with an earthy/cooked mushroom base note and without dairy notes, and with a mildly pungent and not-unpleasant element of burnt rubber. No description, however, has ever fully sufficed to make their flavor imaginable without having tasted them in some quantity.

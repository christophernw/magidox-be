They were popular becasue they had quite the reputation for being "indestructible" and they did have some nice colours... haha, but apple discontinued them to "move on" and bring the nano into full production. Also I think eliminating the mini as an option for people that wanted smaller apple Mp3 players forced them to get the nano's.

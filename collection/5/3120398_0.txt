During sex with a partner with no std will not get std.. If u and yr partner stay loyal to one another in sex life like do not have 2nd sex partner then u will be fine.. So have sex with the same partner, if u still scare of having std with yr same partner, Wear little umbrella( condom ).. Haha fully protect  and ready to go

I'm chubby. I know it.  I KNOW everyone else knows it, too.. and the latter is hard to live with.  . I have plenty of thin friends that love to declare how fat they are getting as they are eating dessert, or are binging on booze...an empty calorie fest.  I wonder if they need the chubby girl's assurance that they do not look like her.... . PopsicleMiss...I am ashamed of you.

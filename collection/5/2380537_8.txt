I think I see what you're getting at here.  I often catch myself and think, "now wait, do I REALLY like this flavor of ice cream, or am I just being influenced by the people around me?". . I never used to like green beans until I met my best friend, who loves them.  Maybe she really did change my opinion of them or maybe it's just a psychological thing and I'm just easily influenced.. . Either way, I look at it in terms of reality.  The way I see it, perception is reality.  Do you think you like it?  Then you do!  I must really truly like green beans, if I think I do.. . If you're having trouble finding things you like, such as a job or a field for a career, well, there's not much I can do for you there.  All I can say is take a look around, explore, check out some books from the library, take a few courses if you can.  See what's out there!  Something will catch your interest. :). . Good luck!

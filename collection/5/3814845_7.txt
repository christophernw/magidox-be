Serviette  has French origins, but if memory serves, this term was brought to Canada after the US became independent and it was the United Empire Loyalists who came to Canada in the late 18th century to remain under British rule. My Mom (she's 80) has always used that term and her mother was born in a UEL enclave in Lyn Ontario Canada. As I remember more, it seems my friends thought it was weird that I used that term as most of them called it a napkin. In Canada the term is still used but it is falling out of favour slowly but surely.

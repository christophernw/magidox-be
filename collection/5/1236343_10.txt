I don't think there is anything wrong with "non-religious" people asking an honest question here. Maybe they are searching for answers. Maybe they are curious. Personally, I am not a religious person, and I don't feel the need to ask any questions right now. But I also don't feel obligated to attack anyone for being religious. You had to know that on each question forum, there would be bashing of some sort.

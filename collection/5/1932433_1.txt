They measure the echos reflected back when waves travel through the earth. There are basically two kinds of waves they study. Natural waves are caused by earthquakes, and man-made waves are caused by explosives (usually set off for research or mining.). . They discovered that while the main wave traveled through the earth at a predictable rate (based on the density of the rock) there were echoes that returned sooner. When the found that these pre-echoes returned at the same time no matter where the initial waves happened, they realized that this corresponded to a layer under the earth at the same distance from the surface in all directions-- in other words, the earth comes in spherical layers like those of an M&M-- peanut inside, then chocolate, then the candy shell. . . As they developed more sensitive instruments, they could tell that there was one reflection coming from just under the crust (the mantle) and another one coming from the core. They may have broken the mantle and core down into more layers by now, but I haven't heard.

Dumass, all kinds of people work in the sun.  Employers hire illegal immigrants because they will work at or below minimum wage, are willing to go uninsured, won't complain about a raise ever, and they can fire them if they complain, get injured, or get sick.  . . If that's what you consider "a job Americans won't do" then you're right.

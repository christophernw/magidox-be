You're right...Congress should share the blame. It's easier to get angry at one particular person and fault them instead of looking at a group of people and figuring out what to do with them. I'm again the war in Iraq and a lot of people are quick to blame just Bush for it but they need to look at the people that gave him permission to go there. Congress should be held responsible for this war just as much as Bush is.

I am sorry to say this, but it is my personal opinion that when we seek something to motivate us to perform some task, what we are really saying is that we lack the discipline necessary to do the things that must be done.  It is a pleasant fiction to believe that there is some simple technique that will magically change us in some way so that we get these things done painlessly and promptly.  We should just give up the idea that wwe can somehow make ourselves "feel" like doing these things,and just do them because they need to be done.  It won't get any better waiting for you to get motivated.. . That being said, perhaps you just lack a system for getting your chores done.  There are a couple of good books: Confessions of an Organized Homemaker and Sidetracked Home Executives, that might help you out.  Can't come up with the names of the authors off the top of my head, but if you go to Amazon or Barnes & Noble.com, you should be able to find them.. . Good Luck!

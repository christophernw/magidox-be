It's not that their prejudice. It's because people have treated them like the underdog for centuries because they aren't white. White people think they have more status than a black man. I personally think it is now the other way around. Look at all the basketball and footabll playres. Look at all the actors and actresses. There isn't such thing as a white person. We all have something we don't like mixed in our blood.

You're right, few know the difference between believing in something passionately and being a f--king zealot.  But everyone's actions do affect all of us, so I understand why it angers people who think they've nailed the solutions and nobody listens to them.  There's also a pretty big problem with people remaining unwiling to even acknowledge the flip-side of any given coin, even if for no other purpose than to understand your own views better.. . As for internet users, I hope everyone else realizes that this is not the way to spread serious ideas or engage in meaningful discussions of topics with no real, finite solutions--  I mean rapping a little here and there about $h!t is all good, a few remarks to get each other open, but nobody's solving serious problems online.

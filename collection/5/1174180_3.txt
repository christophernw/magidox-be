Well, why isn't it so bad to just remove the word from your vocabulary? I mean, if you know how it is defined in the dictionary, and you use it anyway, then you are just as ignorant as the definition.. Aside from which, this is a racial slur that was used back in slavery days. Do you really think you should be running aruond letting that word escape your lips? I mean, come on. Think about what kind of dumb a$$ question you just asked. You should know that not all black people are niggers just like people from other races could be considered just that--a nigger. Which one are you?

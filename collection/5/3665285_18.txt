I can understand why these people migrate here.  My concern is that WE have to learn their language here in Texas in order to get MANY jobs!!!  I've lost out on several jobs due to  my not being bilingual-- and I was born and raised in Texas (West Texas)-- Although, I would like everyone to have a fair "chance" at life, it seems unfair that I must learn to speak a foreign language in order to gain employment.......

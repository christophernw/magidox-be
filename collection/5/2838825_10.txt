The Ten Commandments are just a basis of our living habits brought to us in the Old Testament.  . The Bible also says that homosexuality is an abomination to God, and any sexual immorality.  He also specifically instructed us to be fruitful and multiply--and how can you do that if you are homosexual.  All sin is the same and we are all sinners---but God loves us and hates the sin in us.  If you have a personal relationship with Him- you strife everyday to be closer to Him and live the way that would please Him, as if he was physically standing right next to you.

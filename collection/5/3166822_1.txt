Piriton is easy to swallow, being about the size of the contraceptive pill. It can make you drowsy, so you shouldn't operate machinery, drive etc if you are taking it, and suffer from drowsiness.Apparently there is an alternative to Piriton, called Clarityn, which does not have any sleepy side effects.Do not take more than the stated dose. If symptoms persist consult your doctor. Taking more could be dangerous especially if a large overdose is taken. If you do take more than recommended, call your doctor at once or go to the nearest hospital casualty unit. DO NOT DRIVE.

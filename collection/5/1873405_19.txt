The system is at fault, yes, for allowing ILLEGALs into the country so easily. Corporations will always look for the cheapest labor, so that's no excuse for illegals. Illegals have no higher or better skills than US workers.. don't kid yourself. Illegals are used primarily for non-skilled work such as housekeeping, farm labor, and yes, some semi-skilled trades like roofing, construction, etc. The need for bilingual personnel is a farce. If you illegals would trouble yourself to learn English, you would fit in better, you would show a willingness to fit in, and we might tolerate you more. As for stronger and harder working people, don't flatter yourself. . . All of your questions are just pitiful excuses. You are here illegally and should be thrown out on your butt. ALL illegals should go back to wherever the heck they came from, and if they want to come here to live, apply for citizenship legally. The key word with all of this nonsense is LEGALLY. You are ALL nothing but a collective drain on our country. Come back if and when you can manage to live by OUR laws. We already know that most of the sources of our illegal alien problems are back-woods, thrid world holes in the ground, like Mexico, for instance. Why don't you go debate your worthiness with, oh maybe, a judge or a cop, huh?

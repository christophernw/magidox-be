I think that people feel kind of funny about what they should say or whether they should even acknowlege that they know you were in a psych unit. They aren't sure if you are embarrassed about it, or would be if you knew that they knew where you were. Or they may (ignorantly,due to old stereotypes in the media) envision the experience as something so horrible they don't want to bring it up and "be just rubbing it in), as to where you are. I know that none of this makes sense, but people who aren't informed just don't understand modern day psychiatry, hospitals, and that any mental illness is just a disease or illness like any other. There is, sadly, still some stigma attatched, because people are just unaware. Feel like taking on educating them? :-) Oh, hey--do please get well soon! I hope your visit was helpful to you and you're feeling better.  If I thought I could access my smiley face icons, I would stick in flowers for you here!

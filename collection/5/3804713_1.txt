Hmmm...  Interesting choice of breeds.  I've only trained one, but he and the other Pulik I have met at dog shows are tough, strong-willed dogs that aren't shy about using their teeth if they're pissed off.  They aren't big about warning you before they bite, either.  They need lots of grooming and maintenance for the coat - either brushing it or getting it corded and then keeping it clean.  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone except a dedicated Puli lover.  If you love the corded look I'd try a Komondor - they seem to have easier-going temperaments.  If you decide to get one, go with a female - easier to deal with.

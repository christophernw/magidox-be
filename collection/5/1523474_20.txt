i asked a similare question not too long ago , got some real pin head replys , i'll try to do better by you..  from watching a number of "nova" episodes  dealing with the creation of the univers , string theory, einstine, and isac newton. i'm thinking the big bang you speak of may not have been the 1st big bang , and may not be the last. in fact this big bang may have taken place an infinate number of times already. and may continue for all eternity. some scientist speculate that at some point the univers will stop expanding then slowly over billions of yrs colaps upon itself into 1 tinny little speck... then i'm thinking another big bang ... and so on... not to believe this has taken place infinate times before forces one to envision a begining... and we as humans are "not wired" to do that nor are we wired to truly understand infinity .. it always comes down to .."and what came before that"?... i think its all a long complex dream and when i wake it will all become clear. i recently heard some galaxies[and there are even more distant ones] are so far away you would have to travel at the speed of light for 80,000,000 yrs to get there...its all just too vast to comprehend.  ... and whoes to say there are not universes in the sub atomic particles in your fingernail,,, "just how many angels can sit on the head of a pin?"  only GOD knows

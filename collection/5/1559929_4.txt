A liberal is one with progressive, rather than conservative/traditional views.. . A Democrat is the more left-leaning of the two main US parties, but since we're generally a conservative country (although not me!) our Democratic Party is pretty center-left arguably, in the sense that it often sides with the right on certain issues, if only to gain more votes.

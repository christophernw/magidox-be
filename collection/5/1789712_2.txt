see, i dont' exactly know...so i know i wont' get the 10 points. lol. but i do know i'm confident. however, b/c i have God i have this no fear thing...except for irrational fears you know like bugs etc. however, this no fear to others seems i'm "over-confident" or proud. but in my heart i'm not. i know i'm nothing w/out God. ya know? so that's my story! IM or email anytime and God bless you!

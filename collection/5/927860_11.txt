It's very typical for kittens at this age to start showing signs of going into heat.the last sign is bleeding and the best thing i would suggest would be to get her spayed as soon as possible.  She will be alot happier and you will not have to worry about her discomfort .  I would also suggest keep her separated from any other cats you may have until she goes thru her cycle.

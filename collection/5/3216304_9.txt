Is anyone dumb enough to think this is a game? We're not competing or proving anytihng. War is not & never should be fair. A commander that would allow his force to engage one of equal relative strength is an idiot. . . Just for the record though, I'd point a couple things out. We do in fact have troops on the ground going head to head with insurgents. During the initial invasion there were many cases of hand to hand combat. And oh by the way, our enemy hides behind women & children to detonate remote controlled bombs (IEDs) every day.

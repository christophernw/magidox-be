I have a better one.  When I call one of my service providers it automatically starts speaking Spanish first AND THEN gives me the option for English as prompt 1.  I have no problems with anyone who went through the trouble to become a legal citizen, but these immigration laws are becoming ridiculous. We will be the minorities in the U.S. sooner than later, and forced to speak Spanish to order a cheese steak.

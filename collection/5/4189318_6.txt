He has questioned  the intelligence and dignity of being a soldier, in any branch,in any form, for over 30 years. To any that feel Kerry actually served as a proud American, and a proud soldier, You have my apathy. Had he been an upstanding and proud soldier, he would have never engaged in the traitorous acts after VN,(let alone his actions while he "served" in VN) or made the dumass comments he did earlier in the month.He is ANti- American, Anti- military, and Anti-anything that isn't in the best interest of his favorite person........himself. Any attempt at a political career now will be stifled.

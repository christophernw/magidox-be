I have never found anything that works for my pups. There are loads of suggestion like puppy mats, scented sprays, discenfectant and citrus oils. But the best way is to catch it in the act and take it right outside - even mid-pee. . . Take your puppy out every half hour. If need be, allow it to pee on a hard floor near a door. If you have tiles or lino then that would be ace. Encourage it to pee on a pad or paper in the corner of the room, and when it gets the just of it, start moving the paper toward the door. Do this as well as taking it out to pee. Make a huge fuss of it if it does something outside. Tell it off if you catch it doing something and ignore the puppy for a while. . . A combination of praise, ignoring and training will soon get your puppy to stop peeing. I've done it by the age of 12 weeks. So can you!. . Good luck!  Give the puppy a hug from me.... :)

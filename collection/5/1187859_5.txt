sand is small pieces of rock that has been eroded away from a larger stone.it would take years to get a few pounds of sand from a 25 pound rock but wind rain and snow will break down the rock to produce sand. soil is dirt formed from leaves and twigs from trees. all this will decay and produce soil along with rain and other dying vegetation.go into a densely wooded area and you will find soil.be sure its a hardwood forest.that means maples oaks and other varieties of trees but not conifers, conifers are of the pine family and fir all evergreens.the foilage dropped this fall will take about 2 1/2 to 3 years to decay enough to be soil which is the best for growing flowers and bulbs

The King James Version of the Bible states:  ... And what does the Lord require of thee? [O.T. Micah 6vs.8] but to do justly, love mercy and walk humbly with thy God.  If you can apply each of these 3 things, into your daily life, then you have followed the rules of Christianity.  It wouldn't hurt to consider obeying "Gods Commandments, to include having Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.

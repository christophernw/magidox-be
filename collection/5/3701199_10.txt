May the Lord bless you and may the Holy Spirit fill you. The Lord is not just a God of love, Be careful that you do not insult Him by not reading His word. He wants you to believe in Him and when we believe we strife to more and more like Him. The only way you'll learn more about the Lord, is by praying and asking Him to show you the way.

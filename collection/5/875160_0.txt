La parrillada simply means "the grill", so technically it is a variety of different foods. Grilling is used worldwide, but if you're looking for a more spanish oriented location that it could have originated from you'd probably consider South America, such as Argentina, Venezuela, etc.. I'm not sure if that's the answer you're looking for... good luck! :)

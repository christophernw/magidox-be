If ants wher in human size us humans would be f%^K$d. Since the ant can carry ten times its wieght imagine how strong it would be. They would wipe out humans especially since when they reproduce they do it by the thousands. They would out number and dominate us in just about every way. Humans would'nt be strong at all. The ant would be the predator and us humans would easily slip into the prey catagory.

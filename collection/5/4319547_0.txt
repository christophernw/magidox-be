Titanium and aluminum both form a tough, protective compound after exposure to air-the oxides of titanium and aluminum (and copper for that matter) are not like iron oxide, which flakes off and exposes new surface to oxidation- If you had an exposed titatium or aluminum surface, you would not want to remove the oxide compounds.  The formation of a protective coating of oxide is why the statue of liberty is in such good shape-the copper oxide (greenish coating) is tough and durable.

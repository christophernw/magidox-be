On most rooms it's to the right of the door, just flip the switch.. . I didn't "see" any light or received 2divine inspiration" to become an atheist.. . It's just that all that I heard and read about religion since I was a little kid just didn't make any sense to me.. . Later I read, and read, and read, and read some more and found myself having some pretty interesting arguments with priests and preachers.. . And yes, I'm happy in knowing that I don't live my life fooling myself into believing stuff that just doesn't make any sense.. . Ignacio

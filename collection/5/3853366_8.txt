Most questions come from adolescents, who just want to post here for "shock value".  They want to see just how far they can go, before the question is either removed, or they are banned from the site.. . Its an infantile thing, and when they grow up, they will see that it was, but, at the time they are doing it, its just funny to them, as they are "trying to push the envelope" and see how far they can go!. . I would bet, that, seeing most of the questions on here, they are either from the United States, or Canada, or some English speaking Nation, because most of them are using diction that is some what proper (for thier formatted question, on most accounts), and some slang, (which is normal for a teenager).. . . Oh, and thanks for asking this question, It gave me just enough points to get to level 4... I do appreciate this :). . I wish you well.... . Jesse

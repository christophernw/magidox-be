go to the dentist and have it removed, because getting a root canal is only temporarily going to stop the pain, or if you don't want to remove the tooth then rinse your mouth with peroxide to remove the infection if any then put a hot towel on the tooth and this will stop the pain, but you must keep the air off and stop using the tooth.

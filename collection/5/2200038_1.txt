If your typical head shaking/tilting isn't working, then go to your local drug store, and get something for "swimmer's ear".  It's essentially alcohol drops which will help evaporate the water, but it should be in a healthy regulated dose (as opposed to you pouring in rubbing alcohol or something similar).  I would avoid using Q-tips, since technically the water is probably too far in to be able to be used safely.

When Jesus comes in triumph and saves Israel from her enemies.. . Isaiah 63:1. Who is this who comes from Edom,With dyed garments from Bozrah, This One who is glorious in His apparel, Traveling in the greatness of His strength?— “ I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.”. . Revelation 19:11-14. Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself. He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses.

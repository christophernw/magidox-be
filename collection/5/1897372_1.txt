Japan Invaded Shanghai, which was formerly held by the int'l concession (USA and UK) and the french concession. Japan used Chinese citizens as tests for biochemical activities, and at one time planned to bild a zepplin with gas to poison target californian cities. Oh, and Japan had a mutual war pact with the nazis. Other than pearl harbor and the previous reasons stated..., I see no reason to be alarmed.

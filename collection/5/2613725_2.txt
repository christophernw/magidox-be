Think of it this way: If you're speeding down the highway and you were certain that 2 miles down the highway there would be a police cruiser parked there sitting for speeders, you'd slow down right? Not necessarily because you're a good driver but because you'd want to avoid a ticket. I guess it's the same thing with God. If you were certain his presence was around you, you would act the better person. Not because you like to but because you'd have to. It all boils down to freewill.

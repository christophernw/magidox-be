I find your question a bit confusing... the "real" reason? Are there "fake" reasons?. You've already gotten some good answers. . Salivary glands evolved in tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) producing a watery/mucous secretion that helped food processing and deglution (swallowing). These various glands then specialized in the production of digestive enzymes, antibiotics, and even venom (in some lizards and many snakes, and even in a few mammals). . Our saliva is a fluid that contains water, mucus, enzymes and antibiotics. Saliva helps food ingestion by lubricatong the oral cavity and pharynx, and causing food fragments to stick together. The enzyme ptyalin is a type of amylase that begins the digestion of carbohydrates (its activity is later stopped by the low pH of the stomach). The antimicrobial secretions protect the vulnerable mouth mucosa. . In addition, saliva dissolves the chemical molecules of foos that cause our perception of taste.

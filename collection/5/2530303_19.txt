Honestly, it's in YOUR opinion that those women are murders. To others, it's their body and sometimes the best choice for them. I'm not sure what each case is, but I don't call women murders for having an abortion. I also hope you realize there is a debate whether or not it can be considered murder. Some say life doesn't start until you leave the womb, others say it starts with conception. I say to you...watch what you say.

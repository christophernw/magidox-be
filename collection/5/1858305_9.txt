Well I know why Christians sing hymns, but I am not sure if other religions have hymns and I wouldnt know why they don't if they don't.. Christians sing hymns because its in the bible to do it.  There are several verses.  Some of them are "Speak to one another in Psalms and Hymns and Spiritual songs." "Sing and make melody in your heart to the Lord".  "If anyone is merry let him sing a hymn".  There are many others.. . Also Christians dont only sing songs to teach and uplift each other.  They sing hymns to praise God.

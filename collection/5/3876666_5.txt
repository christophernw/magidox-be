You already have excelent advice here in your other letters. A glove on and let it bite it all it wants to then later he or she will think that you still have the glove on and since the last time it did not hurt you then it will think why do it this time it did not help biting you the last time. Something hot or bad tasting on your hand will stop it from biting you but of course you have to let it bite you to taste it the first time. Let the bird come out on its own that will help, play with it frequent. And watch your birds movements before messing with it. If the bird stretches its wings and stretches its legs then that means it is nice and calm and rested and ready to play. Also no jerky movements like you are scared of it going to bite you no animal likes sudden and jerky movements

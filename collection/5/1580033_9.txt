When Christians try to "save" someone, they are doing it out of love.  I am a Christian and I believe that there are only 2 places to go when you die.  Heaven or hell.  When someone is praying or witnessing for you, they are trying to save you from going to hell.  The Bible does not paint a very pretty picture of what hell is and we don't want ANYONE to go there.  Bible makes it clear that it is impossible for anyone to live a perfect life.  So, the only way we can make it to Heaven is to put our trust in our Lord Jesus Christ.. . What confuse the issue is people think that when you become a Christian, your lives are supposed to become happy and prosperous.  When in fact, when you read the Bible, it clearly states that we will be persecuted, mocked, etc...  But we have the promise that this life is only temporary.  Our eternal life WILL be perfect, peacefully, and happy!. . Hope that helps.

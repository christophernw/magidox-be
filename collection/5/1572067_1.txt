With credit, you sign the slip, and debit you enter your pin ;) Ha. No i don't really know. People say that the bank charges you for debit, because you are able to get cash back. Which is stupid, because half the people that do debit don't even get cash back. But now they are saying that it's bad to use it as debit because machines are saving the pin numbers, and people are hacking into them to make fake credit cards and have thier pins..Lame..why are people so messed up??? oOp,s I messed up my answer...d'oh

Actually it is easier to contract HIV, and any other STD for that matter, through an-al sex, however that has nothing to do with a person's sexual preference. Straight people who engage in an-al sex are more likely to transmit diseases than through vag-inal sex. No matter how you choose to enter, don't take your soldier to war without his helmet :)

You're best bet is to tell an adult.  Talk to your counselor in school and let them know what's happening.  Your friend needs help.  You can help her by being supportive, and listening to her when she needs someone to talk to.  Other than helping her get help and being there for her, there's nothing else you can do, but please know you're a great friend and she's lucky to have you.  I hope everything works out!

Blood carries red blood cells which have hemoglobin in them. Oxygen binds to the hemoglobin, and the red blood cells disperse the oxygen to all parts of the body. When there is a significant loss of blood not enough oxygen can be supplied to the body. This is called hypoxia. When you become hypoxic your brain does not get enough oxygen, and a symptom of hypoxia is dizziness. Other symptoms include nausea, seizures, coma, shortness of breath, headaches, fatigue, and even death.

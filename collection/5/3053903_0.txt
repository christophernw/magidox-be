The Act of Union was passed by the Parliaments of England and Scotland in 1707 (when Queen Anne reigned) which formally united England and Scotland as the Kingdom of Great Britain, making the title "King (or Queen) of Scotland" superfluous.  Charles I and II reigned in the mid-17th century, when Scotland was still a distinct political entity -- thus, "King of Scotland".

M81, the Andromeda Galaxy is part of a local group of about 17 (if I remember correctly) galaxies that act as a local system that interact gravitationally and rotate about a common centre. Therefore sometimes they are getting closer, and sometimes further apart, somewhat as the planets in the solar system do.

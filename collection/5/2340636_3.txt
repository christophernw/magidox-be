Don't let the clutch out with the engine idling.  Slightly increase the engine RPM as you let the clutch out.  This is normal.. . IF the clutch is grabbing even tho you try to let it out slowly, there may be a problem with the clutch its self.  The throw out bearing OR the linkage could be sticking and suddenly releasing when you let off the pedal.  You could have some oil on the clutch or pressure plate.  The clutch could be going bad.. . Try increasing the engine RPM FIRST before getting too excited with the other possibilities.  Good luck.  Pops

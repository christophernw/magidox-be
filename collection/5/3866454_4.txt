There's so many different effects that it's hard to classify, really. I've had various songs make me hyper or mushy or so calm I was about to fall asleep, and sometimes just a certain chord combination can bring tears to my eyes.. . One thing a lot of others probably won't mention though, is that music makes me draw better, because I'm not constantly worrying about how bad I suck. And if I run out of ideas, the song will make me think of more.

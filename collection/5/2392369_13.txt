I actually answered that last guys question. And I answered another one of your questions :) Although I don't agree with you AT ALL, I will tell you what I do when I don't agree with something going on. I write to my Senators and Representatives, and if you ask them too they usually will write you back. In fact, Senator Sentorum just wrote me back today. They are pretty nice even if they don't agree with you. You also could get involved with others who have the same position as you, and make fliers to help spread your message. You may find people who agree with you on here, or you could try Myspace, or even do a search for "stopping homosexuals from adopting children". But please if you do this, use actual statistics and facts about why homosexuals adopting children is bad. I just say that because I know it would take a lot to convince me otherwise. Also, you could go to Law School and change it yourself someday! Good luck!

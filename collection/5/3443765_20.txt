I believe each one of us must answer this question for ourselves. Don't ask  anyone else. Ask God. If you believe in God, believe that God will answer if you sincerely want to know. And if you believe God is not answering you, then believe also that nobody else can give you the answer. Believe that if God doesn't answer you, God thinks it's not important at this point in your life for you to know. From my own experience, sooner or later, God will answer you. Just don't give God a deadline. God can choose to answer you in the afterlife.

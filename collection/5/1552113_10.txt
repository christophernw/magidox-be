Racist policy?  To immigrate legally in to the United States is a Racist Policy?  Its what people have been doing for over a hundred years now!. . Those who break the law, and come in here ILLEGALLY, should be prosecuted to the fullest extend of our laws! They are "BREAKING THE LAW"...or, dont you believe in the law? . (Bet you do, when some one is breaking into your home and you call them to protect you, dontcha??). . Well, its the same thing. They are breaking into this Country illegally, and we have to protect our Citizens. They run drugs, gangs, diseases (yes, some are coming back strong that we have wiped out in our Country because of the illegals, bringing it back with out innoculations!).. . Jesse

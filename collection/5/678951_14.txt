Is there a full moon out tonight?. . The bible does not prohibit smoking or alcohol. Drunkenness is forbidden but I can't remember any passages mentioning smoking.. . Plus there is always that pesky separation of church & state thing.. . Although I do agree we would be healthier if we didn't smoke or drink alcohol (or drink modestly as most doctors say) it is an individual choice - not the states nor the churchs.

Well, right now in BC, Canada we can't. There was so much rain that it caused a landslide to fall into our reservoir. Our water was disgustingly brown, it's gotten a bit better but still smells like creek. Most restaurants won't serve fountain drinks or anything made with ice. We have to boil our water for now, and the markets are in high demand of bottled water. There have also been some fights that broke out over bottled water. I can't wait till things go back to normal.

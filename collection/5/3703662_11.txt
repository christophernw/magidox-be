I have a chihauhau mix. He was a cute teeny tiny puppy with a great personality. Plus I wanted a challenge and had heard that chi's are difficult to train. Needless to say, I have a great companion with loads of personality and a great big heart. He's really smart and makes a great addition to my lap when it's cold outside. Plus, he's great to baby and I love pampering my pooch!

Any circuit is a combination of a source (i.e. battery) and a load (which may have elements that are inductive, resistive, and/or capacitive).. . For a resistive circuit, Voltage = Current * Resistance. . If you increase the number of batteries (i.e. voltage) without increasing the resistance the same amount, your current will increase as well.. . Similar relations hold true for capacitive and inductive elements ... all you need to do is transform them into "resistive equivalents".

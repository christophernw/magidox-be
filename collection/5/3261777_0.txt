Most of the Indian farmers are small farmers and they work in the fields along with other hired farm labourers.Still the tilling of the soil is done by engaging the bulls/buffaloes.Indian farmers hardly get any remuneration worth the name and mostly are indebted to the banks/lenders.They dont have any federation to fight for fair prices .. American farmers have vast lands and manage with sprinklers etc and most of the operatrions are mechanised. They live in comfort.. I hope you got the picture now!!!!!

I really don't know if the rate goes up amoung family members other than if depression runs in the family but I can tell you from a first-hand perspective how suicide affects loved ones.  My uncle committed suicide when I was 19.  He left behind 3 young children and was the youngest child in his own family. The first to die.  On a personal level I was absolutely devastated. Even though logically I know his suicide was not my fault or my problem to solve, it did not stop the tremendous and overwhelming guilt I felt for not having seen the signs. He and I were very close buddies and spent a great deal of time together fishing and goofing off. He was more like a brother to me than an uncle.  He died nearly 15 years ago and to this day I still cannot speak his name without my throat constricting and my eyes tearing up.  I fear it's a pain that will never completely go away.  I had nightmares for years after his death, primarily dreaming about what I could have or should have done to stop him.  . . His children, once highly functional and secure young people, became completely screwed up.  One child turned to drugs and alcohol and has had many run-in's with the law.  Another developed an eating disorder and suffered through a failed marriage.  Not surprisingly she married a man quite a bit older than herself, trying to replace the father-figure she lost on some subconcious level.  The rest of the family still cannot talk about his death.  One mention of his name sends them all into a bawling frenzy.  Our family has been absolutely devastated by suicide, no doubt about it.  Personally, I don't think anyone else will commit suicide now simply because we DO know how it affects others. I'm sure when my uncle pulled the trigger he never really thought it would impact us so much.  Suicide is the most ultimate selfish act one can perform.

Hmm... tough situation. Here's what I think. First off, coming out of the closet might be a little premature. You are still in the middle of your teenage years, so there's a good chance that your hormones haven't settled completely. Try giving being straight a shot, at least for a little while longer. Who knows? In a year or two, you might change your mind. This would also give you time to graduate and get out of the house in the event that you DON'T change your mind.. . In the meantime, I think your idea of talking to a minister about the situation is an excellent idea. It's a shame you can't get your pastor to talk with you anonymously. I would advise you to first seek out other local Baptist pastors that you feel you can trust. If that fails, try a Catholic, Lutheran, or Episcopalian minister. I know for a fact that all three denominations require their priests to take a vow of silence in regards to private talks unless you specifically say it is okay to talk to others about it. I'm sure they could help you deal with this issue.. . I guess my advice, in a nutshell, is "bide your time and think it over." Between you and me, I had a brief spell at around age 14 when I started to wonder about my own sexuality (I wasn't turned on by guys, but my utter failure with the ladies made me doubt my hetero credentials). Six years later, I am a firm heterosexual with a lovely girlfriend that turns me on in all the right ways (and places... but I digress. Haha!). Of course, the situation might be very different with you, and you might indeed be "hardwired" to be homosexual. All the same, I think it would be better for everyone involved if you took time to ponder your options, consider a way to tell your parents, talk to someone who can help you through this, and make absolutely SURE of your sexuality before you take such a huge life step. I wish you the best of luck!

i think its because of surroundings: most beautiful people have so many other people jelouse of them that always can come up with something wrong... (just to make themself feel better) and also magazines, you look in those airbrushed magazines and its like... you can never look like that, so it puts a beautiful person down, when really NOONE looks that perfect, not even tyra banks..(dont get me wrong she is beautiful). and to top it off, most goodlooking girls get some boyfriend jerk that cant ever just say you gorgeous!. oh and instant karma... i feel you to girl!

wow shamefaced, well Im thinking it means not looking at others in the eye with opinion, flirtation, aggression or any other thought that might be meaningful. the bible is very "old-school" in the way that it thinks of women. Please do read it if you are trying to change your life but please dont take it too literally. you can be a good person without loosing who you are. women have come a long way in history. If you are trying a new faith I suggest reading some other books too. Go to that section of the library or the book store. have a wide veiw of faith rather than a closed mind. good luck to you

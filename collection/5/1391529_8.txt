Why should they stop breeding them. They make wonderful family pets. Its when they fall into the wrong hands they become mean. Its not the dogs fault but the owners. Breeders should be a little more responsible to who they sell their puppies to. Any dog can be mean it just the stupid people doing that for fighting and other crap. Besides you have more of a chance to get bit by a little dog than a big dog. So instead of blaming the dog blame the person behind the dog!!!!

To make the perfect cup of iced coffee, you need to brew the coffee double-strength (use double the grounds in the filter as you would for a hot cup of coffee)  Then add a few cups of ice and chill.  To sweeten it, I suggest liquid sweeteners like a simple syrup because granulated sweeteners are hard to dissolve in cold stuff.  Sip and enjoy!

People like to bag on Wal-Mart, but the secret to their success is brilliance (ruthlessness) in keeping costs down and a willingness to operate at razor thin margins.  Walmart doesn't make much on each thing the sell, they rely on volume.. . Wal-Marts famous fopr not paying their employees much, but aside from that they have (probably) the best diustribution system in the world.  They move massive cargos around quickly and cheaply.  Get those store shelves stocked with what they need the day they need it.. . Also they're utterly ruthless to their suppliers.  You make Microwave popcorn?  Walmart will go to every major manufacturer and say "We're going to carry 1 brand of microwave popcorn, and thats to the company that can offer us the best price."  This forces the popcorn maklers to accept the same kind of razor thin margins as Wal-Mart itself.

The cathoilic church tries to accomodate it's set of dogmas to such scientific knowlege as becomes to well established to blatantly deny.. The Big Bang theory set very well with various religions, because it implies a moment of creation and as such a creator (though I don't see it thatt way myself). Other theories that say that the universe did not begin with the Big Bang, that talk of, for example, paralel universes and such are more difficult for the church to explain and incorporate into it's worldview.. Moreover, the more we discover about the universe the more insubstantial our role in it seems. People used to belive the Earth was the centre of the universe, now astronomy and cosmology tell us that there are many other planets orbiting counless distant suns. Even our universe it seems, may turn out to be of no special significance (other then to ourselsves). The special relationship between god and men was always a big feature of religion, now that is beeing called into question as well.

I am so sorry that you lost your friend. Your friend made a choice to try the heroin. Street drugs are not safe for many reasons, ie. dosages aren't accurate and you can't be sure what's in there. I don't think God took her as an example. I think that guy killed her, but ultimately it was her choice.

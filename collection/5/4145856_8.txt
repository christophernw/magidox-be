For some reason, the Mexicans on this board seem to be the only illegal immigrants coming forward.  I haven't seen any one say they were from anywhere else.  . . We know not all the illegal immigrants are from Mexico, and we know our ancestors all - legally- came from somewhere else.  I don't see what that has to do with not wanting to pay subsidies for the education and health care of poor people coming in from another country in violation of our immigration limits.  Our own children's education in Southern California, for example, is now substandard.  Hospitals that have to give health care to those who can't pay are going out of business and the cost of their health care is being spread amongst the rest of us.  Because of that, 40% of Americans can't afford health insurance, it is so expensive.. . I am opposed to illegal immigration because poor people use more services than they pay into the system in taxes, even if they pay all taxes, which in general they do not.  That is why there are legal limits on immigration.  People who come under those limits are welcome.  Those who don't are stealing from taxpayers and stealing the chance for a decent education from our children.. . You are young and have never had to plan for your children's education while also trying to set aside money for retirement when you can no longer work.  When you have done that yourself, I think you will understand what we mean.  Mind you, if you are rich, unlike most of us, the issue may never hit you.  But that will only mean you are ingnorant of the problem, not that it doesn't exist.

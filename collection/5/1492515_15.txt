another logical fallacy by an evolutionist.. . you are responding to "if we came from apes why are there still apes".. . The difference is, God didn't say dirt evolved INTO man. He says He formed us from it. AND that we will return to it, so if we will return to it, there must continue to be some. This is very scientific. We are carbon based beings, and when we die we desintegrate back into it. Modern science couldn't describe it more succinctly.. . You say we evolved from apes. Why didn't all apes evolve then? Why not pigs? Why is there only ONE species to evolve into a logical being? Those are much better questions.

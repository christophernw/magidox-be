I can empathise with you, as I have made many errors in some of my questions and not noticed them until they had been posted. (people will be only be too quick to point them out don't worry). . . Unfortunately though you have to live with the mistake. However, what I try to do now before posting a question is keep previewing and editing where appropriate. Once happy with it then I submit the question. . . I suppose only those of us who have made mistakes will understand what you mean.

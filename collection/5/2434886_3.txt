Technically, we don't know if they do or not. We can only guess from examining their eye, we don't know how their brain actually processes it. . . The theory that they can't has to do with the "cones" that process or pick-up on different color wavelengths in your eye. Humans have three while dogs only have two cones - reasoning suggests that therefore they only see the world in shades of gray i.e. black & white. . . Another study suggests that their eye has many smaller cones that can pick up on some colors, like a human with colorblidness.. . We don't know manily, but we can guess.

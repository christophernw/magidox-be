The Old Testament dealt with the coming of Christ and people were instructed to act in a way that would prepare them for the coming (e.g. they offered up blood sacrifices as a symbol of Christ, etc.); the what the Jews believe is in preparation of the coming of the Messiah, which they believe hasn't happened yet.  Once Christ came, he put in place and taught a new and higher law, which we find in the New Testament.  So, you're right, Christ was Jewish, but he fulfilled the teachings which were taught prior to his coming.  When he died, people referred to his teachings as Christianity.

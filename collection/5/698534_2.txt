Essentially its the same thing from a user's standpoint. The dish is an actual satellite dish that is mounted outside of your house in order to recieve the television signal whille digital cable is facilitated through the underground cable line from your local cable company. . . What makes the dish programming so good is that it has interactive menus and program guides that you could not get on regular cable tv. Digital cable gives you the best of both worlds because your signal is not affected by snow, wind, or rain the same way that the dish is affected.

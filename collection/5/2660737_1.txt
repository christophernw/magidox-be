If my life, or more importantly, my childrens' lives depended on someone like this, I would be absolutely mortified!. . I'm with you mate.. . But did you see that guy the other night?. . Some guy from Brazil asked the question, o.k. he was polite and gave customary greetings but went on to say it is 11.44 p.m or something and the room temperature is 28 degrees centigrade (mispelled horribly). What time is it in London and what is the room temperature?. . Yeah, right.. . I suppose a sarcastic answer would have been it just flew up when you asked!

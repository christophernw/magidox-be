that usually means wanting Christian people to accept the so called fact that there is no God.  Why come to Christians with that when you already know they will not agree with you.. . You belivev or you do not, one side is never going to convince the onther.  If the Christian side is wrong no one has anything to loose because there is nothing after death.  If the Christian side is right, I feel very sorry for the other side.

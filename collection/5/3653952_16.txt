the confederate flag was one of the battle flags in the south. It has nothing to do with people being African American. If you looking into the history of the flag there was most likely there were some African American men that fought underneath that flag. Why should we be afraid of flag when we have people trying to change our national anthem or try taking God out of our schools and our government. When they come here for freedom to have the right to their own religion and lifestyles without bias or judgment. Some people want to keep up with history and traditions. Why should we judge that.

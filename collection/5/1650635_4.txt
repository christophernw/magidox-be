that depends on your criteria for proof of existence. what hidden force creates the perfect spiral in a sea shell? is the mollusk living within creating the spiral, or just providing the raw material? i think things like that start to point the way - when you see order, intelligence, organization in the body of an individual being, or in a large system, such as our solar system - in the sea shell, created by a blob of life simply BEING - never thinking, and in a spiral galaxy, you have the same spiral. when you see order manifest out of seeming chaos, what intelligence formed that order? you study naturally recurring patterns. you can not "see" God, but you cannot see electricity either. God energizes, and creates our plane of reality (do i know this? no - i'm speculating like everyone else) yet does not dwell in it any more than we dwell with the bacteria within our own intestines even though we are present there.. so to deny one the use of symbol and metaphor in contemplating God is to take the fool's materialistic view of rigid and narrow mentation. doesn't math use metaphor when it likens a symbol to the quantity or entity it represents? you're not going to be able to come up with a Godalyzer - some kind of machine to measure the infinite. many poets, artists, musicians, philosophers, mystics, et cetera would say they have some sort of intuitive relationship with god that they FEEL and is inexpressable, but the closest approximation is in symbol, metaphor, poem, song.... for how do you measure or prove love without metaphor? you either feel it or you don't. it has no physical, measurable substance that we've discovered scientifically discovered so far. it just is. i say give up on this mechanistic approach to the etherial which, when you become better aquainted with the world of metaphor and symbol, seems to open up a bit, leaving those who need "solid proof" behind to study their charts and graphs.. that's my opinion.

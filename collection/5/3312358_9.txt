First of all, there is no such thing as a 'Mormon Priest.'. . Second, The priesthood is the authority to act in God’s name. The same priesthood authority that existed in the original Church established by Jesus Christ exists in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today. The Church is directed and led through this authority. . All male members of the Church who are prepared receive the priesthood in order to help lead the Church and serve Heavenly Father’s children. A man with the priesthood might serve in some of the following ways: . . Leading congregations of the Church . Performing the ordinances of the Church, such as baptism . Blessing those who are sick . God expects those who hold this sacred priesthood authority to follow the example of Jesus Christ and serve with love, gentleness, and kindness. . . Not long after Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery received the Aaronic Priesthood, the ancient Apostles Peter, James, and John appeared to them as heavenly messengers. These Apostles gave Joseph and Oliver the greater, or Melchizedek Priesthood. This gave them the authority to organize Christ’s Church and direct the preaching of the gospel throughout the world. Christ’s ancient Apostles ordained Joseph and Oliver as Apostles and special witnesses of Christ in our day. . With this ordination, the same authority to act in God’s name that was enjoyed in Christ’s original Church was restored to the earth.

If you look at the anatomy of a spider, you will see it has an anus like other animals to rid its body of waste material. Often you will see pieces of its food caught in its web and this has been eliminated from its body as "poo". However, they do not drink water and have no opening in the body to eliminate fluid waste, so they do not "wee".

A military recruiting pitch will have many of the same features as a telemarketer wanting to interest you in a loan, an appliance, any financial opportunity.  They will tell you all the attractive features - things that you'll find appealing and a benefit - and neglect to say anything about the downsides.. . Hence....listen to the pitch, ask questions, then go home and ask questions from someone who does not have a vested interest in your decision...wait at least 24 hours before making these kinds of life choices, never on the spur of the moment.  The war will be there waiting...there's no hurry.

Hydrogen cars is the answer and mass transit. In Europe you can travel cheap on Bullet trains now. Bu$h let the Energy Companies write the current energy policy and they will fight Hydrogen with big buck payoffs. The problem with the Bu$h agenda is that Bu$h favors high prices for oil. He would never except price controls. Bu$h even stopped Federal Price caps.. We spend $6 billion a month in Iraq and rebuild there roads, Sewers and schools but America is in bad shape when you look at the level of investment made by other countries in mass transit and alternative energy.

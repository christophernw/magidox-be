I'm an atheist and I'm very happy. I used to go to church all the time and blah blah blah. But then I just decided that I don't want to live my life by anothers rules. I just felt too much pressure from religion, I had to conform to the rules and restrictions of god. But I do agree with most of the teachings, the bible is a great guide to how to be a good person. But so is Buddhism, and the teachings of the Muslims. But jesus never walked on water so why would I follow him? Science still exists and evolution is the truth (Mostly!) I do believe in a higher power but I don't think any religion has it right. I think that the "god" up above is just some sort of power we'll never know about until after we die, maybe not even then. I don't think we should worry about it, this god thing is far more powerful than us and doesn't need to interfere with our lives so why should we bother trying to figure it out. Take from religions what you will, but I won't bet the farm on it.

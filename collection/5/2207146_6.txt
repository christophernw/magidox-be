No he is actually talking about the showerhead.. . When you are in choir, the instructors encourage singing in the shower because the humidity helps loosen your vocal cords.. . If he didn't mean that, which I'm 99.9% sure he was, he was probably giving his wee one a nickname.  Theres no other terminology.

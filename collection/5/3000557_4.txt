Exercise will demand fuel from your body and increase your metabolism.  Walking, biking, lifting weights....really anything aerobic and physical.  A good way to get a metabolism boost is to walk a 15min. mile with spurts of jogging in between.  You know, walk 3 minutes, jog for a minute.  The benefit of this is your metabolism will be running on "high" even after you stop your activity.  So...get away from the computer and go for a walk!

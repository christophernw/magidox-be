The purpose behind christianity is not about figuring out where you can or cannot cross the line.  The bottom line is the fact that Jesus paid the penalty for your sin, so you could be open to a true and connected relationship with the Living God.  . . He has called you to fellowship and communion with Him in a spectacular way.  We are being brought to the time in the garden before the fall, where Adam walked in the cool of the day with God.. . Your question itself shows the desire in mans heart to press the limits of sin and discover what it is he can get away with.. . If you eat of the tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil you will surely die.  But the tree of Life you may freely eat.  That tree is God Himself. . . In other words, if you were married and in love with your wife would you figure out what was just necessary to keep her as your wife.  Figure out the rules and just obey them, or would you be more involved with discovering who she is and what she likes. And probly staying clear of things that might potencially upset her.  Out of Love.. . To answer your question.  Ask Him.

Dear friend,. all the above answers are correct, but they missed out some thing:-.. . 1: japan was the most powerful wall of the world war. it had shown it's threat to countries like china and russia.. 2: USA used to be a  part in WW II by indirectly supply arms and ammunitions to the allies before 1944, but it never took part in the war..... suddenly on about 12 december 1944...the japanese planes bombarded the pearl harbour of USA without any warning of attack. One of the biggest ships of USA was destroyed, the port was devastated and around 236 army mens and civilians were dead. (the wrecked army ship still is there showing it top fleet as a memory).. 3. the undeclared attack was a serious threat to american security and esteem. it unconditionally had to push itself in war in order to save its allies and their money and to take the revenge.. 4. soon the germans were defeated. USA asked japan to surrender, but it refused....... why would japan surrender....they were still powerful.....they do or die men.. 5. USA wanted to test the atom bombs and so japan was the only target. they knew the consequences to some extent and so chose some of the ancient cities of japan nagasaki and hiroshima. it also made them take the revenge. and it did not warn the japan of the bomb. anyway......most american congressmen too did not know about the decision. the pilot who dropped the bomb is said to have gone mad seeing what he had done.. . after all, war gets no profit.......but it does teach a lesson. USA realsied it mistake and vowed never to use them again though they didnot help japan recover from it to a large extent.. . . hope you are convinced.

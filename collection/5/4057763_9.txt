Ge 3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. . . The bible doesn't say that she had to convince him of anything. They were fooled at the same time by the same devil. Notice that the verse says that "she gave unto her husband with her". He was not in Europe somewhere.  They were listening to the same lie at the same time.

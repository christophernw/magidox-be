if the baby comes out feet first, I runs the risk of have the cord wrapped around the neck,and can choke it to death. If the baby comes out head first, doctor can make sure the cord is not wrapped around the neck. Also the head and shoulders need to come out first as to allow the vagina to stretch enough to allow them to slide out.

I don't believe in god because I don't believe in anything that cannot be scientifically verified. I've nothing against religion or religious folk, and even think that religion does a lot of good for some people. I do believe that too many people have died in the name of religion, but people will be people, and will always manage to find something to argue over, be it poilitics, money, land wars, or what have you.

I know that different Christian groups have different views on this. My own view is that baptism (christening) a young child is a way of connecting the newborn to his/her religious heritage so that he/she can appreciate his/her religious heritage (family's past) more fully when they grow older. I don't believe that unbaptized children are "lost" but I think it does help connect them with a faith when they grow older.. . btw--I was baptized as a child and again as a young adult (in my search for my religious roots and heritage.)

The Da Vinci Code is a book that the writer wrote claiming it was full of facts. It is 80% lies, 20% fact. The problem is that no writer messes with the "true" history when writing books. Dan Brown decided to lie about history and about the characters in order to get people to buy his book/movie.  Dan Brown's history is twisted because he believes in the Gnostic Gospels... which were written around the 3-4th century... a few hundred years after the Apostles and therefore are not reliable at all. . . The problem is that over 40 million people around the world have read the book, and many will even go see the movie... which means that the information written in his book will become something those readers/viewers believe as facts of history....when they are not facts or truth at all. . . The next movie coming out will try to discredit the fact of Jesus ever existing and so you can see a pattern.... the wicked world and false religions are gathering together to try and get people to believe lies about Christ and Christianity, which if not researched, can cause so much damage to the faith and thoughts of people who dont know the real truth about history and Christianity.  . . Christianity is the only belief/religion in the world that is attacked as much as it has been down through history (even in the Old Testament times, before a "personal relationship with God" through "Faith" was renamed- Christianity). The reason is because Satan doesnt care if people want to think they are "good moral people", or even go to a church or temple or worship center... he doesnt even care if people are of other religions... he just doesnt want anyone to know the truth about how they can be saved and have a new life through Christ, by accepting the gospel message (http://www.NeedGod.com) because that means he wont have company in Hell once the unsaved are judged by God and sent to an eternal hell for (attempting to cover up)their crimes against God. . . http://www.DaVinciMessage.com

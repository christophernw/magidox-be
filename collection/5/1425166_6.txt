The media are prostitutes and have a liberal agenda.. . And I'm a moderate that leans a little liberal.. . The news is not THE NEWS.  The news is a show just like any other show on tv.  They are just trying to get ratings, and to further their own agenda at the same time.. . The news is the biggest foe anti-illegals face.  The only person in the media that I've seen that is on the anti-illegal side is Lou Dobbs, God bless him.  I'm sure there are others, but I haven't seen them.. . Maybe we should start contacting the news organizations and demand they show the HONEST news.

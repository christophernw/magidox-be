There is a simple theory to how Satan came to rule Hell. Satan was the right hand of God. But he became very aware of his own beauty. God did not allow this. So, Satan then also wanted to overthrow God off his throne and become the ruler of heaven. So, God said that if he wanted to rule a kingdom he could rule Hell. So he was send down there. And Satan is bad because he is the leader of the dammed, so supposedly you don't want to mess with him, or he'll take you to Hell. Not a pretty place, or neither is it cool...

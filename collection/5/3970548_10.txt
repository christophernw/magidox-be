I would ignore them. There is no need to respond to/forward chain letters, regardless who they are from. I think they're a total waste of time and energy. I know that I don't have to prove that I love Jesus by forwarding something to everyone in my address book and I promise, you won't have bad luck in love for seven years. :)

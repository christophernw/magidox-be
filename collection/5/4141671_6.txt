Have you been to Mexico lately?   Do you know how Mexicnas treat immigrants?    Mexico is mucho malo!. . . . Often the latino cannot even speak their own language well because they are to lazy to educate themselves.   Their country is to rotten to care for its own.   If that's all they can do is clean a toilet, whose fault is that?

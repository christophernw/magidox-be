It depends on where you are from.  In Massachusettes it is $30 and if you are underage you need a parent to consent.  If one of your parents are not in the picture you have to put an ad in a newspaper for one week to see if it will be disputed by your other parent.  If you are over the age of 18 you can call your local town hall or the town hall of the city you were born in and they can give you more information.

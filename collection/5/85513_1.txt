Profiling is not "racial".  Race is only a part of it.. . If a middle aged white male is seen talking to a child that later disappears, it is not racial or gender or age profiling that causes the police to detain and question middle aged white males.  An offence has occurred and they are investigating.  . . Would it be profiling to stop white cars if one was seen used in a robbery?. . When a threat has been made, a crime committed, the police are obligated to investigate.  That includes race, color, creed, gender, dress, age and all other factors.. . The benefits of profiling, in general, means that you are at least looking in the right direction.

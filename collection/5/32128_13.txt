Trust me I can only speak for myself, I'm 51 disabled had to go to court to have a judge make the decision....I can't even drive.....uncontrolled seizures, plus 18 surguries....& every time I have doc. appt. (and mind you i am in a wheelchair)  never a handi-cap spot available.....so my husband has to park a mile & push me in the damn chair....very frustrating...

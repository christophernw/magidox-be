After a certain age nobody has to go to school. You can remain ignorant if you want to. You can spend a lifetime watching people getting all the good things of life, while you work like a mule for next to nothing. The choice is yours. Oh yes, the bible. If you really believe that all you have to know is in the bible, you'd better figure on a life in a convent.

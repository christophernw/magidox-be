well,well,well...........you must have not yet found the correct religion. as well as the so called Christians that get mad. reality is christian or not we all at times get mad. no one is perfect at this time on our earth. however, your bible states  that perfect Jesus got angered for the right reasons. so  if one gets angered its to be settled  in a quick amount of time. it says make peace with your brothers. don't let the sun set in a provoked state.Cain got angered because able brought an offering from his heart. he cain killed able over being envies and for all the wron reasons.

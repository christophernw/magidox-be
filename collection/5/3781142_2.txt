okay well first take care of your symptoms: blow your nose, take vitamin/echinacea (sp?) and a Sudafed, gargle (for sore throat- use Glycol or just use warm salt water).  Maybe make some tea to soothe ur throat, find some throat losanges to keep in ur mouth.  Then u'll be able to go to sleep (which u should try to do as this will help u feel better!)

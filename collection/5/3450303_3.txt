Depends what country you are in but in the UK we have Horse Watch which is a register of stolen horses, we also freeze brand our horses so the freeze branding companies usually have a list of all those reported stolen.  If the horse has a brand or breed society mark any where then that might help, also try scanning the horse as it might be microchipped.

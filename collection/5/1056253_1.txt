I can't tell you how it'll be this year because I'm not a meteorologist so... just be prepared for it to be cold, because chances are it will be cold. If it's windy, then it'll feel way colder. I doubt if it would snow...it doesn't really snow too often, although I'd like it to. You might be able to search the weather from the previous years and predict it from that.

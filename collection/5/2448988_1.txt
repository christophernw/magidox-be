RG-6 is double or quad shield cable suitable for distribution of cable TV in home wiring, good up to 1 Ghz. frequency. It is low loss, so longer runs see little signal loss. Due to it's excellent shielding, it has very good rejection of outside interference. On the other hand, RG-59 is a cheaper, smaller TV cable, that has a higher loss, and poor shielding. It is not recommended for a good home TV distribution. It is widely used in black and white 'security cameras' due to it's small diameter. However for color, the cable is susceptable to interference, loss with length, and poor high frequency transmission.

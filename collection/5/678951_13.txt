I do not drink, nor do I smoke, but I truly think you have been drinking or smoking something stronger then they drank in the Bible. They did not smoke in the Bible because there was nothing to smoke. Tobacco was brought back to Europe from the Native American Indians who did not read the Bible until the Christians ripped them off of their land and sent them to mission schools to teach them the white man's way. Something like we are doing in Iraq today. I wonder why that is not working either. And as far as no alcohol in Saudi Arabia... it is like the Tom Haggard show. On the surface you preach all the tenets of the religion you trying to ram down peoples' throats, but in the back your consorting with those vile, filthy. nasty sinners because they are having a hell of a lot more fun then you are.

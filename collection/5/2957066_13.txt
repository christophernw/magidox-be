If cats PLAY together even once, they never fight for real ever again, even though they can pretend so well at it that it looks like real fighting.  All it takes, though, is just one social engagement of play and they've made some kind of social contract not to kill each other for real.  Sounds like your cats are beyond murder and true mayhem.

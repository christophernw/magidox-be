I have been visiting 4 times a year since 1991, the situation is good and the improvements are amazing, life is totally free.. The mafia boys are all either leaving or becoming legitimate- "the mafia car thieves have now become insurance companies, so you pay them legally not to steal your car before not after". I like Bulgaria & Rumania and the people but it will take another 10 years to get it right and for the general public to see real benefit especialy the old people.. Bulgaria and Rumainia were not part of the Soviet Union but were communist states.. My advice to you is to go on holiday to Bulgaria, the Black Sea coast at Varna and up the coast is excellent, quality and cheap.

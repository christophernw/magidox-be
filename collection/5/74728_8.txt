There's 2 fundamental differences.  Few, if any, of the christians claimed their acts in the name of God...and christians universally and unequivocally condemn such acts by their own.. . In contrast, islamic terrorists always invoke the name of god and few, if any, muslims unequivocally condemn such acts.  . . Therefore, there is no double standard.

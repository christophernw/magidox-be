Individual counseling is one on one between the counselor and the client. As opposed to Group Counseling or Marital or Family Counseling., where other people are involved. In Individual Counseling, the emphasis and focus is on the treatment of the individual and often times the counselor will focus on only the individual even if that individual is married or in a relationship.

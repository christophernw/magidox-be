I'd suggest the same - put the litter box in the bathtub BUT first see if you can figure out why the cat isn't using it ! Maybe it's the actual litter product that your cat doesn't like ? And make sure it is clean, they sure don't like using a dirty litter box. Be patient yet consistent with whatever training method you choose ! Don't yell at the cat 'cause it won't know why you are upset. And yes be Thankful it's IN the bathtub and not on your carpet or furniture !!

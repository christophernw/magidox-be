Usually to immigrate to the U.S. you need to have a Citizen or Resident Alien here to sponsor them.  They also need to apply for and receive a visa that will give them legal access to come to our country.  I know of people who applied to bring family members here and had it take 11 years for approval.  We have quotas on some immigrants and this also causes the wait to be longer in some cases.  No one should come to this country illegally, however sometimes it may seem to someone who has the dream of coming here the only way to accomplish it.. . You can not just open the gates and allow anyone who wants to come the ability to do so we would run out of room to live if it came to that.

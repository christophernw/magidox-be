Gen 2:7 (KJV). 1) dirt; 2) the breath of life; 3) equals a LIVING  soul. We are the soul, we do not posses one. When we die, Like Porky Pig used to say "That's all folks". We are dead, We know nothing, think nothing, do nothing, say nothing, go nowhere, see nothing. How much more clearly I can  put it? When you are dead, that IS IT. End Of Story!

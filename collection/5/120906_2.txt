The term 'serving suggestion' is used on pre-prepared food when there is a photo or picture on the outside of the products packaging showing the product being sold along with another product that is not supplied. I.e. If the packaging for a loaf of bread had a picture of bread with cheese and ham on it, it would have to state 'serving suggestion' on the outside of the packaging. This is down to false advertising regulations.

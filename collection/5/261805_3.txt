I would think this would relate to when they are locked onto a pray and hyperfocus.  The third eye lid would clean their eyes without them loseing their target.. .   Also the older breeds, "Big Cats" (another words lions, tigers,.. etc), and back in time had to deal with constant environmental things bothering their eyes...  I don't know how else to explain it, but when your in an area with alot of pollen or water there is always something getting into your eyes.  Tigers end up in water, Lions end with with dust and animals they are chaseing kicking things around and the debris and dust landing in their eyes,.. some cats live in areas where there is constantly snow... every where so that gets into their eyes.  Do you catch on to what I mean by Environmental?. . The Third eye lid is more common with animals that end up submergeing in water, going through dark places (night vision), and some environmental situations (creatures that end up trying to hold still in a very dry or very wet environment).. . Hopefully someone else will know ALOT on this and get very technical.  I don't like the people that just pull up random sites and say that's the answer because some websites do not produce true or acurate information,.. so I'd like to see what someone actually types out.

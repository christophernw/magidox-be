Do to the lack of information I can not be accurate. It could be a miss on one of the cylinders, Could be a weak fuel pump. Could be a clogged injector, could be the toqure converter (if it's an automatic) could be a bad or worn motor mount, could be bad fuel, clogged fuel filter, could be a stuck choke. But again with the information you gave I can not be sure.

hi hendro the real way to be come a follower of Jesus is simply to pray ask Him to wash your sins away, tell Him that you believe He is the son of God and that you believe in Him then the most important part that no one ever told me was that you have to live by the bible as much as possible and if you fail as forgivenss. Don't fail on purpose but if youdo you have an advocate with the Father. God will change you as you divein to His word everyday and pray to Him too

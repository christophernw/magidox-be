Loss of water occurs in a trans-fashion to generate 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is what you would expect the product to be.  However the double bond isomerises to generate the actual product, purely because it is more stable.  The more highly substituted a double bond is the more stable it is.  The actual product is a trisubstituted double bond as opposed to the original product which is only a doubly substituted double bond.  Terminal double bonds are even more probe to isomerisation, another reason for the product you see being formed.. . The isomerism of double bonds is a key chemical transformation in synthetic organic chemistry, and is used a lot to move double bonds from outside of rings, to into rings.  For example methylene cyclohexane will readily isomerise to 1-methyl-1-cyclohexene just by heating.. . Hope this helps.

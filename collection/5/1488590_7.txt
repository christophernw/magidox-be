I haven't had the pleasure of suffering from car sickness, but I know a few people who have.  These are some of the things I have notice them do to help them cope:. 1. They open the windows for fresh air, or if the weather is too bad for that they blast the AC, and they don't use harsh car odorizers.. 2. I notice that they drink water before, during, and after driving,(or riding in a car),...mostly during.. 3. Most of the time they drive at a constant speed and hardly ever use the breaks harshly or take turns sharply.  As a matter of fact, if they aren't driving like grandma then they aren't driving at all.. 4. If they are passengers and it is a long trip, they sleep.  Sometimes they will take a pill or something if they aren't driving.. . Try fresh air and water, then if that doesn't work, talk to your doctor.  But if you are driving, be sure not to take anything that could affect you.

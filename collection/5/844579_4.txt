I want to do that also. I have researched this. In SC, there is a form on the net you print off. Once you fill out the form, you are to take it to a magistrate. He is then supposed to be able to take care of it without going to court or anything. But you also have to provide a criminal background check. I haven't tried this yet, because I am afraid it will not be as easy as it is made out to be once I try and I will be very discouraged.

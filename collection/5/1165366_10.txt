The Da Vinci Code is one of my favorite books!. . The book tells a story of an American symbologist and a French cryptologsit who discover clues hidden in Da Vinci's art.. I don't want to give away the secret...but you asked.. . The book remember is fiction. The claim is that Opus Dei ( a Catholic Sect) is hiding the fact that Jesus and Mary Magdeline were husband and wife and that he (Jesus) fathered a daughter.

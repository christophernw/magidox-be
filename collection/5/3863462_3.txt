The expression "Good Luck" now days is purely and for the most part - JUST THAT - an expression. We Christians don't believe in luck - and many of us use that expression from time to time or "You were lucky" and so on.. . If a person really was into "Luck" I suppose that would make a difference.  I wouldnt worry about anyone who gets offended. I don't think the person you mentioned was offended, he or she was probably just adding to or simply bringing up being blessed.. . I mean really - you aren't into luck as a religion are you? Most likely not.

Pressure from the electromagnetic radiation streaming out of the star.. . IIRC, every star is at some equilibrium between gravitational collapse and flying apart due to heat/pressure in the interior generated by the fusion process.  When the fuel being burned in the fusion process is depleted, the star begins to collapse until the resulting pressure ignites the next fuel stage.

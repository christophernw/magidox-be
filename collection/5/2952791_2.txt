a transcendental number is a (possibly complex) number that is not the root of any integer polynomial, meaning that it is not an algebraic number of any degree. every real transcendental number must also be irrational, since a rational number is, by definition, an algebraic number of degree one. the most well known example of a transcendental number, of course, being pi.. i hope this helps?

The reason why ice has a bigger volume en lower density it's because it's mass doesn't change.. Remember: D=M/V. . The reason why the ice doesn't contract when cool it's because the that water molecules arrange to form regular crystal structures (ice).. The way they need to be arranged to form ice occupies more space than normal water, thus it has a bigger volume but it mass remains the same. And therefore it has a lower density.

Thats so simple. . 1: DNA is a double stranded helically coiled molecule. It is made up of a backbone of deoxyribose sugar and phosphate group and the links are made up of sugars purines and pyrimidenes. there are two purines:- Adenine and Guanine & two pyrimidenes:- Cytosine and Thymine. A combines with T and G combines with C.. Whereas RNA is single stranded and Thymine is replaced by Uracil.. 2: DNA makes RNA by transcription and RNA makes proteins by translation. . 3: DNA is the genetic material in most of the organisms whereas RNA is the genetic material in some RNA-viruses only. . 4: DNA is of 2 types according to functiom and placement: . linear (nuclear) and circular (organeller). According to the shape and turns, DNA is of 7 types but RNA is of a 3 types: ribosomal, nuclear, transfer.. 5: DNA can replicate itself but RNA needs to convert itself into DNA and then replicates.

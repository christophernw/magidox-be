You don't normally go to a 'PhD' school for pharmacy, you go to a PharmD school.  To become a drug dispenser, ie a pharmacist in a local drug store, you need this degree.  The AACP has more info.  They said the time to graduation is 4+ years, and a bachelors degree is not required.  But check specific schools that you are thinking of applying to.  We have a PharmD school here in Houston (Univ Houston).

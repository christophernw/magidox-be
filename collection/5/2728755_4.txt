freeing millions of people from a murderous regime, is none of america's business. only iraq can solve their own problem. just like you. if you have problems with your girlfriend, is it ok for you that a person of no relation just comes up to you and punched you. there must be something more behind it. take philippines for example, marcos held the philippines for more than 20 years, who saved the philippines, of course filipinoes with their "people power". did americans helped? nah, what will they benefit if they helped them? i feel sorry for those who died in vain in iraq.

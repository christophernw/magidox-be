"History" is defined as a record of events.  Thus, "recorded history" is redundant.  Something must be written down in one form or another to be considered history.. . Thus, the oldest known code of laws is probably the codex of Ur-Nammu, a Sumerian text from approximatly 2065 BC (over 4000 years ago).

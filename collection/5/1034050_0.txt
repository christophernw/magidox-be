The answer about greenhouse gases is correct, but careful with the answers about ozone.  The hole in the ozone layer is a separate phenomenon caused by the release of chlorofluorocarbons, which were used in aerosol cans and cooling systems, and which are still leaking from discarded refrigeration systems despite having been banned by international treaty.. . In general, the ozone layer has thinned, resulting in an increased risk of sunburn and eventually malignant melanoma (skin cancer) worldwide, particularly for northern Europeans who have relocated to tropical and subtropical environments.  The native residents of these areas are partially protected by their melanin (darker skins).  In particular, global wind patterns have trapped chlorofluorocarbons at the poles, resulting in a much greater thinning there, and a measurable hole over Antarctica.  This phenomenon, while dangerous to our environment and to us, is entirely separate from global warming.. . Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases work much like glass.  When visible light passes through glass, it is slowed down.  When light slows, its speed doesn't change, but its wavelength done.  It is red shifted, and the lower spectrum of visible light becomes infrared or heat.  Glass is not transparent to infrared light, so the heat cannot escape again.  This is why a car parked in the sun heats up, and why leaving the windows open a crack can keep it from getting too hot--you're leaving an escape vent for infrared light.. . To make matters worse, the heat output of the sun varies over time, and we're currently in an uptick.

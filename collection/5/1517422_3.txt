Practice, Practice, Practice! Use lots of film, the more the better. Start in color (cheaper) always take pictures of different places, different scenes, or hell, just a different angle. Most people don't know, but a camera can only take you so far. Look at something with a lot of light, the more white in the photograph the better. Get something old or just old looking to begin with, like... a train, or just railroad tracts, trees, grave stones... old buildings, stuff like that always looks good in black and white. Just keep Practicing, as much as you may hate it, it helps.

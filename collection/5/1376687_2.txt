It is possible to locate and observe the Apollo landing "sites," but it is *not* possible with current equipment to see the hardware left there, since their sizes are far too small to be resolved successfully. For example, a common backyard 6 inch aperture telescope can only resolve craters on the moon which are about 1.5 miles or so across. Even telescopes with a resolution comparable to that of the Hubble Space Telescope can only resolve details about 100 meters across (the size of a football or soccer field). Lasers fired from Earth are bounced off special retro-reflectors left at these sites by the astronauts, and the faint return pulse is then detected by Earth-based telescopes equipped with special instruments to measure the Earth-moon distance, but otherwise, we can't see any man-made equipment left at the landing sites. If you wish to see the sites through a telescope for yourself, here are the approximate locations of the Apollo landing sites

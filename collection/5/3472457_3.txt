You can get ideas from the Internet and Yellow Pages. Try International Direct Enquiries If You Want Something Abroad. You can book anywhere, but, hotels overseas always require a credit card to guarantee your booking. Some hotels require that you have a fax machine to send confirmation too. You can ask the hotel for their web site addresses too, often these will show you a menu example. You can request these to be sent by the hotel direct too. 8 out of 10 will send them no problem. X

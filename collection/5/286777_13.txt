... what's that on your head? Never mind. I have never given the "excuse" you have written, and in fact I'm laughing at your stupidity as I type this. Personally for me it's a preference. I wanted to be gay, and I wouldn't change back. Some people like orange juice, others like apple juice. As I said, it's preference. Personally, I don't like your hair in your picture, but you do, so again, preference comes in. . . I get that you're homophobic... and well, get over it. I have.. . Big Kiss *MWAH* :P

I am not a doctor, could be the same thing. But I can guess.. . Relapse = Having gotten rid of the cold but not the bug and it comes back and you waisted your time the first time.. . Reinfection = Getting bug, getting rid of bug, getting bug again (Maybe even worse.) But then again I dont really know for 100% sure.

You should try to contact your biggest book publisher, I know, it's not fair, I felt left out when the sixth book appeared all over the world last July, and Serbian translation was due to September... I felt terrible, so I can imagine how could you feel not having a translation at all.... Try making a web page for all those that would like to read Harry Potter in your own language, make a petition or something, and send it to the publishers... Some of them are sure to recognize a good business opportunity in that.... Good luck!

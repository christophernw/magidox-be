Try aerobic exercise with strength training. There are no creams that work. Even thin people have it. You can try using  self-tanning products to hide it, because its more noticeable on pale people. But its like streach marks its something almost everyone has even models have it (oh the wonders of Air brushing, giving use unrealistic ideas of how people should look). I have a low BMI and almost to low body fat, workout every day and still have some of it, its not too noticeable on me but its there.

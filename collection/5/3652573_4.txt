everybody should have equal rights but in India, the tradition of women working has started very late as a result the financial independence has come very late. so they have been depending too much on the male members of the family. I believe to fight for your rights too u need to be independent. One more reason is divorce is a taboo, hence only one can do is compromise to have the comforts of life.

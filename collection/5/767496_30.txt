Habits are like an iron suit, difficult to get out. Rather than pay an organization to help you to change: heed the advice of the sages - Maimonides said that to change (slightly) in a direction you need to over-emphasize that direction to the extreme. But instant it will not be. So if you are rude, and want to become more polite, try to pretend you are an 17th century nobleman, so that everybody thinks you are overpolite -then eventually you can revert to normal politeness, i.e. you cannot attempt to change slightly. . . .

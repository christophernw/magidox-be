Spiritual warfare is the mythical battle going on in the spiritual realm.  The concept is not from the Bible, but from the books of Enoch, which were prominant in Hellenistic Judaism as well as early Christianity.. . Those books were dropped by the church of Rome because they tended to undermine the authoritarian nature of the 'Jesus as god incarnate' myth.

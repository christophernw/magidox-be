I'll tell you how I got here: my parents screwed. Who knows what really happened? My theory is that a massive cocktail olive exploded to form the universe, and eventually, pieces of the olive clumped together into sandwitch nebulas, which are nebulas made of sandwitches. Over time, blueberry pies began to orbit the sandwitches, and the gravity from the pies pulled hydrogen atoms out of the sandwitch nebula. Then, the hydrogen started to clump together and started nuclear fusion, and all stars are actually pieces of hamburger left by German spaceships from Holland.

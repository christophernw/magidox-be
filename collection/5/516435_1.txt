I've been in the spare parts business for over 25 years. You can start with a relatively small inventory if you do it right. Marketing and networking are 2 important keys to sucess. If you don't have it,you can't sell it. Hook up with some major established salvage yards and negotiate a good discount. Maybe subcribe to one of the locating services. That way when someone needs a part, you are the only call they need to make because you'll always be able to find the part you need. send out fliers to repair shops announcing your business. National Motorcycle Services publishes the best directory for m/c salvage yards. Make sure you're listed with them.Maybe pick up one of their books to help you Network.

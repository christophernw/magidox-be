look around for a breeder and visit the parents.. the best way of determining a dogs personality when it is grown is by seeing its parents.. particularly its mom.... NEVER buy from a pet store or puppy broker.. if you cannot see the mom dog you should not buy the puppy.... . ear cropping is generally frowned on unless its a show dog and is actually banned in some countries like England...

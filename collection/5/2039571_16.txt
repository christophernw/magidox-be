If you ever get a chance, take a trip to one of the poverty stricken third world countries. When you see their situation you will be so ashamed at how rich you really are that it will make you nauseous to spend money unnecessarily or unwisely. I know this because I have done this. Even a trip to Mexico helping Habitat for Humanity with your local church or volunteer group might expose you to just how bad most Americans squander our money.

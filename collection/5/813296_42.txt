The value of your evidence depends on your desired result. Are you lookiing for scientific validity? . . Statistically, to know something is true you need to have a siginificant sample of your univerise. If your universe is of 1 (i.e. you want to know the significance of something that is true for only yourself) your own anecdotal evidance is 100% valid. . . If you want to know what is true for the residents of smallville (population 10) then anecdotal evidence of four residents would probably give you pretty valid conclusions.. . If you want to know what is true for a much larger population, you would need a much larger sample size. For example, if you want to know what is true for a population of 5 million people, you would probably need evidence from several thousand people. Since anecdotal evidence does not generally encompass that large of a sample and is more difficult to collect and quantify, it is less valid than more quantifiable data.. . The value of any kind of evidence depends on the purpose of what you are collecting your data for, the availabilty of other kinds of data and the size of the universe you are investigating.

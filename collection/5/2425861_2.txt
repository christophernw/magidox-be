Only God can forgive sins.  Because Jesus was true God and true man, he could forgive people's sins during his earthly ministry.  At the end of his earthly ministry, he SHARED that RESPONSIBILITY with the Apostles.  After his Ressurrection he tells the Apostles, "If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them;  if you retain the sins of any, they are retained" (John 20:23).  Which means that if an Apostle forgives someone's sins in the Church, God also forgives the sins.  As the successors to the Apostles, the bishops continue to have this power in the Church, and they share it with PRIESTS when they are ordained.  This is why only a priest can forgive sins.

Once again, the supposed "Christians" are attacking you and saying YOU don't know what you're talking about, even though it's a proven and well-documented fact of THEIR religion.  :). . For those naysayers, this is absolutely true.  The Catholic church did not include many things from the ancient Jewish texts.  Yes, your bible was tampered with by the Catholics.  . . You just haven't done your homework.  Funny how the atheists tend to always know these things, isn't it?

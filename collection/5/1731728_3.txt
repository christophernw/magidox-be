catholicism IS a christian denomination, so there is no difference there.  all christian denominations i'm familiar with rely on the idea that accepting christ as the son of G*d who allowed  himself to be killed to attone for the sins of humanity is THE path to heaven.  kind of an exclusive club that much of the world just isn't qualified to join.. . buncha' malarky, if you ask me.  good people are not punished in the afterlife, and bad people don't get a pass if they say some hocus pocus on their death bed.

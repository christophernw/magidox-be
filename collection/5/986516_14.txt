I think it is because people read a lot less nowadays. If people read more they learn how to spell things better and your vocabulary is increased. We cannot use the excuse that the English language is to complex this is not true, i have many friends whos first language is not english and they can sometimes spell better than the people who have lived in an english speaking country all their lives.

I was a little silly on your last question, I'll try harder this time.  . . The reason I personally find them distasteful is because of their verbal tactics.  I have a strong dislike for anyone who tries to obscure the meaning of what they're really trying to say with equivocation and verbal sleight of hand.  Truth is something precious to me, more precious than freedom, comfort, or my own life.  I have no time for people who don't know how to be truthful.  . . Now, I'm not talking about spiritual truth, my God is righter than your God stuff.  I'm an agnostic, so I don't care about that.  I'm talking about representing yourself as one thing when you are actually something else.

Musicians, singers and artists in general have a particular emotion when they create their work and we can definitely say that they transfer their emotions to this work.. Because emotions have psychological effects, music can have very wide effects.. . it can soothe people.. . it can anger them and bring some violence [i am thinking about rapper dmx]. . it can bring joy and that little feeling that makes you want to dance. . it can bring up past memories, bad or good. . it can bring sensual feelings :-). . in short, it can bring all kinds of emotions. However, the listener has to be in *the* mood to bring that kind of emotion. For example, a very harsh and violent heavy metal music can have no effect on someone who do no like this music, do not understand the lyrics, or whatever... I travelled in a remote non-occidental country and made natives listen to emotion-charged music and their reaction was just like ?ugghh? they just thought people were either shouting, fighting, crying or whatever... For people like this, they would assimilate this music to noise and the effects are none. . . However, i find that the more you listen to a tune, the more you feel what the singer had in mind, and the more you feel the same way ie violent, passionate, or calm...

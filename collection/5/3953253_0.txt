The system uses high voltage to ionize molecules in the air mostly oxygen to ozone. Ions have an electric charge sort of like static electricity they attract dust particles and create a heavier particle that falls out of the air. also dust particles are attracted to the high voltage plates much like your tv screen attracts dust.

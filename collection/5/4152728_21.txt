Choose?!? EXCUSE ME?!?! We don't choose to become mentally ill. I never chose to suffer from depression or an anxiety disorder during all the bouts I've had off and on since I was 13. I would choose to never have to suffer from it again but I know there's a chance for a recurrence in the future. I just don't know when it'll happen. Now people who suffer from metal illness can choose to receive treatment for it like I did with my last bout and will do in the future.

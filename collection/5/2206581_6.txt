By educating yourself, you will be moving toward the Buddhist goal of "infinite service to all that is."  If yo dont' first take care of yourself, how can you possibly be of service to others, or to maintain infinite reverance for all that was, with infinite responsibility for all that is to come?  The ying is the cause, the yang is the effect.  Life breathes in and out just as you do.  With no inhalation, there can be no exhalation.  With no education, there can be no teaching.

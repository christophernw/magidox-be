If you can catch and can cope with the mess a hammer would make, then a hammer would do well. Might be best to put some poison down and they disappear and die. Also put a trap down with a sultana on it, not cheese, and you will surely catch it and put it in the bin.. If you love animals then get a humane trap and then let it out into the garden. If he doesn't die of cold he will find it's way back into your house.

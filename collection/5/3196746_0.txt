I used to use Soft Scrub with bleach to get things white again, but that was a while ago. I'm sure there are plenty more products out now. To clean inside the carafe, I would put ice cubes, lemon juice and salt, and it worked like a charm; maybe a lemon-juice mixture will clean the outside as well.. . This is why I have turned to black appliances :)

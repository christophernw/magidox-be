Because we end up paying for them to live here, and we can't afford to support everyone. We can't even support our local people that are in need. It's like having a stranger show up at your door, and expect you to feed and clothe him or her for free, when u already have 10 childern that u can't afford to feed and clothe anyway. So thats how alot of people feel.

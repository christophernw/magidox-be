The theory is that inflation is partly caused by people spending too much money, often using credit cards to borrow money to supplement their income.. . Raising interest rates makes it more expensive to borrow, so it discourages people from spending, thus controlling inflation.. . No one really knows how this works exactly, but it does seem to work in practice - thus why the US and the UK now use it as a core part of their fiscal policy.

Sugar and water will separate on it's own as long as it is not brought to the boiling point. Mixed and to let settle, the sugar will sink to the bottom of the pan/bowl. Thus you just strain off the liquid. On the other hand, should you bring to boil and cook slowly, add food color or flavor and WHALAH!!! you will have what is known as "HARDTACK" candy

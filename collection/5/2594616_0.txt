Because water cools at a slower rate than the land does. .... . Thermal radiant heat is absorbed faster by the land BUT it also loses is just as fast.....think deserts and you'll see what I am talking about.  . . Where as water absorbs thermal radiant heat at a slower pace BUT relinquishes it at a slower rate as well.....it's always warmer on the coasts when compared to inland regions.

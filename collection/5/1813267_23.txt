Oh No! Don't do that, it scares me! Go to a drugstore tomorrow morning or tonight if it's severe and buy a earwax cleaning kit. It's sold OTC. An earache is so painful, I know. I hope they feel better. You can safely take up to 800mg of Ibruprofen to hold over till you get that kit. Good luck to you.

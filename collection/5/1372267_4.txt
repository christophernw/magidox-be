whoa girl.my little sister did that and she regrets it to this day. that was over 20 years ago. get back to the dentist and get them put back on. and dont worry about youre looks. braces are really attractive. they are. it shows you have a great smile and parents that dont mind spending thousands of dollars looking out for youre best interests. and you should apologize to youre parents for youre mistake. they are going to be very upset. just get the braces put back on.

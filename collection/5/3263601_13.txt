The Marine Corps did not lie to him. They told him they wouldn't send him if he was 17, but now he is 18. That makes him a grown man, and he should stick by the commitment he made, wether they  send him to Fallujah, or to Cherry Point, NC. However, by his actions, he has shown himself to be whining, snivelling brat, and maybe he shouldn't have told his mama he was going off to play Marine.. . By the way, when you join the military, you should assume that you will go into harm's way, rather than assume you won't. It'll be easier in the long run for you.

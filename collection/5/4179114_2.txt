Well, when you talk to a girl, be sincere and sweet.. Trust me, girls love sweet guys.. Think about what you want to say before you say it.. It may sound dorky, but brainstorm ideas of what you will talk about, or even write them down.. Remember, people will like you for you.. Be confident in yourself because there is no one like you.. If someone doesn't like you, then that is their problem and their loss.. email me if you'd like. save_the_treesxox@yahoo.com

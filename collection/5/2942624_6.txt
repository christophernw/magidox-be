Oh gosh, this was a daily occurence for me when I lived in the midwest.  I'm talking getting asked about my ethnicity, sometimes in a very rude way like "what are you?" by strangers multiple times a day.  When I lived in NYC I got asked less, and in London way less.  Some of it has to do with the culture in those places-- in the midwest it is socially acceptable to start conversations with strangers, while in London it's not so much.. . Sometimes, when it is men doing the asking, it is a really bad "line" and they think I am "exotic" and they like that.  That's the quickest way to make me walk away from you!. . But I think the main reason strangers ask someone that is indeed xenophobia, or fear of the "other."  Many people are uncomfortable with racial ambiguity.  Unfortunately, most of these people are not even aware of why they really want to know (nor are they aware that their question will be considered rude by most people).  Try challenging one of them and watch what happens-- they become very defensive.  If the question bothers you, you are under no obligation to be polite.

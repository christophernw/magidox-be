They've had it (unofficially) for many years.  They aren't threatening to annihilate another country.. . Israelis don't set aside a national day each week to chant hatred for another nation like the Iranians do toward the U.S.. . Bottom line:  It comes down to "trust", and the Iranians are severely lacking in that category...

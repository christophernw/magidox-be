I don't think it so much that dying scares me.  It scares me to not know how I'm going to die.  My biggest fear is to die by drowning or by fire.  But if I could die in my sleep ooooooh that would be great and I wouldn't have a problem with it at all.  . . It also scares me to die of a sickness where I'm in a hospital waiting to die.  Also it's a bummer to be told that your about to die and there nothing a doctor can do for you, so once again I'm just waiting to die.

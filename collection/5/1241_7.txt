to make it simple and brief, homeostasis is the maintenance of the internal environment in the living body which is always influenced by the ever changing external environment.. for example, temperature,pH of blood ,salt content,blood sugar level.....all these are maintained perfectly by the mechanism of the organs in our body.pH of blood by kidney which regulates the content of H+ ions in the blood to maintain the pH of the blood, sugar level in the blood by liver and pancreas,salt content in the blood kidney,temperature by mechanisms like perspiration,etc

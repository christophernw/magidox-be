Sincerely I didn't like the question, but I am happy to explain my stand.  Pakistan's leaders need to spread 'India hatred' to stay in power.  Pakistan's love to muslim world is evident through their insincere alliance with USA - cheating USA and the muslims simultaneously.  They always save their face in the Muslim world by the Kashmir issue.  They want to create problems in India and other part of the world because stupids always do that to get the attention (like the back bench students in a classroom).  They are the worst example of Islamic anarchism.  As a matter of fact India is trapped with its islamic population which is the second largest in the world.  They, like the communists, wherever they live and eat do not show any respect or thankfulness to their society.  And finally to Bill Clinton, who gave a slap to Indian's face... Its often hooligans and garbage people who won a street battle.  What your pakistan do in Kashmir is ethnic cleansing, we Indians never did that to our muslim brothers in our country. They live with total freedom (maybe not in your sense to keep knife to others throat).  Those lost true victories are just compromises for our own people and for the rest of the world.  Before vultures eat our dead bodies.

I dont don't believe most of u said to help people learn the language!. . Think about the world of computers!!. . You going to have a keyboard with over 10000 keys?. . Pinyin has become a necessity due to computers. You input pinyin and the computer converts it into a character.. You can tell who uses a computer or SMS's alot just buy who can spell pinyin well and who cant.

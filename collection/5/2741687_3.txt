Make a hypothesis: this spell will have a certain effect.  Argue the reasons why it will happen.  Then, test it.  If you have verifiable evidence that this spell works, it is no longer magic, but science.  It's as simple as that.  People that said that the world revolved around the sun were accused of being heretics.  Without the ability to verify this as true, it would still be considered a magic fraud up to this day.

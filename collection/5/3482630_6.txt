to be honest, i used to have to take 4 ibuprofen at a time, and put one of those "kool strips" on my forehead (it's a fever reducing patch for children). That worked for awhile, but then I was put on Inderal LA which is a medication for various heart stuff, including blood pressure, and that helped immensly for a month or so, no headaches whatsoever. Then that stopped working, so now I am HCTZ, which is a water pill that helps my blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure, you might be getting migranes from that. . . I have also taken Imitrex, that stuff is good!! 25mgs didn't work for me, but 50mgs did. GO TO YOUR DOCTOR, they can help you out immensly with migranes

Masturbation has nothing to do with penis size or growth. If your voice only changed recently, it might be you're still in puberty. Your penis is apt to get bigger. But don't worry that you've done anything to keep it from growing. Cutting back on masturbation frequency will make no difference. Be glad that the guys in the locker room don't know how big it is erect. (But you don't about them either, do you?)

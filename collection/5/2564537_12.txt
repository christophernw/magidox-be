A TRUE Christian ONLY answers to Christ,none else,and they do not pray to the virgin mary or bow down to idols,or answer to man(pope).Catholics believe that the virgin mary hears prayers,they do WHATEVER their priests tells them,and especially the pope,and they fall down and worship to idols and pray to idols(saints).Catholicism is a false religion,they say they are christians and follow Christ,but that is lipservice only.

This is not an easy question to answer, since in most states, there is no simple answer.  In general, a parent may use "reasonable force" in disciplining a minor child, but what is "reasonable" from one situation to another may vary greatly.  For example, the use of force would be more reasonable if an older child is at risk of seriously harming a younger child, than if that older child was simply late for dinner.

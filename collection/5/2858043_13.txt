I agree with John Mirra.  Practice tolerance, understand that you, yourself are not perfect.  Practice being humble, understand the meaning of a humble spirit is a wealthy spirit, one that is in true communion with your maker.  Practice kindness, understand that being kind to others shows that you have developed into a mature adult.  Only mature individuals understand the significance of tolerance and how that develops our pysche to transfigure into a more spiritual, emotional true-SELF.. . Good Luck and Prosper...;*!*;...

Public speaking is an art that requires practice. Ah's, eh's, and um's are all common filler words that Americans use when they are unsure of their next set of words. For a prepared speech I would simply practice the speech several times before actually delivering it. However, if you are part of a situation that involves impromptu (no notes; press conference. e.g.) or extemporaneous speaking( limited preparation and some notes; class report . e.g.) breaking the "ah" habit will be much more difficult. First, instead of using a filler word, just pause for a moment. If you are at the end of a sentence this will appear very natural and I guarantee the pause will seem much longer to you than it will to the audience. The pause will benefit the audience allowing them to absorb what you have said, and also benefit you, eliminating the ah and providing time to reorganize thoughts.. . If you listen to Jazz musicians speak about improvisation they will always mention the importance of silence in improvisation to providing actually musical quality. Imagine if The drums and horns never stopped playing. It would be a cacophony no one would enjoy. The same holds true for public addresses. A speaker that never stops is a speaker no one is going to truly listen to or at the very least enjoy.. . Of course, you should practice avoiding filler words in all of your conversations. Habits we develop in everyday speech will also pop their heads up in public addresses. Therefor, even if you are just talking to a friend about some trivial matter, try to avoid filler words.  Don't be afraid to ask you friends to point out when you use any. . . As a final piece of advice, if nothing else seems to work to get rid of the ah's, I would suggest "practice sessions." Practice delivering a speech in front of an audience (humans, not cats or babies) and have the audience throw things at you or squirt you when you use a filler word. Physical teaching is even effective in speech. . . Best of luck.

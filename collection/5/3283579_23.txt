Gnostic Gospels were written after the bible was already fairly well set.  They were written several hundred years after Christ.  The Gostic Gospels were used in part by the goups Mohammad took over and its influence can be seen in the Quran.. . the problem and the concern is just like your lack of education on the gnostic Gospels,  people have accepted so much of this fiction as truth,  . . Most fictions use some fact, and the movie and book show these false info, the secret society which was proved fake in france, the art work which has no art histroy basis and so on.  Even parts being sued by copyright issues in several countries as taken ( some word for word) from various actis of fiction.. . If people would merely understand that it is fiction, but they seem to accept these things, like the Gnostic gospels which is well known as being false gospels of latter writtings,. . There were some other gospels that did not make it in, but only a few,  Gospel of Thomas was one,  and some like Rev and 2nd John barely made it.. . But in the end all but 2 Bishops approved the bible as it was.  But it was not really a hard issue, all of the approved gospels were in use by all the major churches,

In the alveoli oxygen is at a higher concentration. So it diffuses in the pulmonary capillary blood where the gas concentration is lower.There it combines with the haemoglobin in the RBCs and forms an unstable compound oxyhaemoglobin and then taken to different parts of the body.. Simultanious with this process, the CO2 from the cappilaries, which is at a higher concentration, diffuses in to the alveoli and eventually exhaled from the lungs through nose.Thus in this a principle of Diffusion is at work.

Taxs. it grows like a weed anywhere you plant it. If it was legal anyone could grow their own. Whisky is legal but it dosent grow in your back yard it has to be made if you want it you have to pay tax. if the gov controled all growth of weed then they would be able to tax it. tobacco is nasty but taxable even though it should be as illegal as weed.

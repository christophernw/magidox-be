It was true more in the past than it is today.  American cars are still behind in quality but are closing the gap.  In the past the big three car makers had control of the north american market, they could make shit cars and people would have no other options but to buy them.  But competition came from companies with attention to quality, and the american companies didnt take the threat seriously at the time.

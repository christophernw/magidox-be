I don't think Jesus ever intended people to live without morals.  A flexible standard such as yours allows you to justify whatever you *really* want to do.  You can justify sex before marriage (you see that everywhere today), or outside of marriage (people who commit adultery can always find a reason, the classic being "my wife doesn't understand me").  . . I think you are attributing something to Christ for which there is no justification.  If you are a Christian, you should be living by Christ's standards -- and that means being a moral person.  Christ did not discard the 10 commandments; he raised them to a new standard: "whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart." (King James Bible, Matthew 5:27).

Many of our traditions, like the Christmas tree, have pagan origins. The early converts took many of their pagan traditions and adapted them to represent Christ.  St. Paul did this when he told the pagans that the "Unknown God"  that they worshiped, was  the God he was talking about.   .  The tree today represents the tree of life, the cross, which is now covered in bright lights and decorations to show Christ's  conquering sin and death.  The evergreen tree does not shed its bows in winter.  It lives in the coldest climate.  The Christmas tree represents God's love which does not die even when all around us is cold and seems dead.

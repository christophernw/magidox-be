School is not just for practical learning, such as adding 2+2.  Learning about history, language, arts, abstract mathmatics, etc, makes people more intellegent, more decisive, and more succeful in life.  When you learn about something, you may not use it in real life, but it will certainly open your eyes to something new, therefore making you more aware of the world you live in giving you a greater ability to make judgements in your own life and career because you have a heighten sense of awarness.. . Someone who has gone to only ninth grade as opposed to someone who has gotten their associates degree have vastly different views of the world.  The person with more education is more aware and can make judgement about life in general with a more aware state of mind then the person without it.. . That is why education institutions teach things that we don't use everyday.  We really do use those things, just not practically.

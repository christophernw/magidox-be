Because if there were a God that watches over us, why would innocent children go to bed hungry, have no home or clothes, become victims of molestation, die in the 9/11 incident? Why would innocent minors SUFFER for hours before dying?Why would women get abused by their husbands? Why would God give too much to some and nothing to others? Okay and to go on with all of this, I have argued this before with Christians and I get the response "When God closes a door, he opens a window". I do believe the victims of hurricane Katrina (Who are still trying to put their lives back together) would rather have left that door open no matter how things go for them later. You asked, I answered!!!

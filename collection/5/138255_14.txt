oil breaks down after a certain period of time.  You dont want oil with no lubricating properties in your motor if you  plan on keeping your vehicle for longer than a year.  New cars dont like bad oil as it can clog up filter, lines, and the oil pump.  Most old cars are forgiving but only to a point.  Old oil clumps up after a time and gums up the valve springs and everything else it comes in contact with inside the motor.  You want your motor to work smoothly, not fight itself just to keep running. I'm an ASE certified tech in case you  were wondering.

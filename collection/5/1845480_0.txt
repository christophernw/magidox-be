The first estate is the clergy; the second, nobility; the third, commoners. The use of the "fourth estate" to refer to the press dates back to the first half of the 19th century and is generally attributed to Edmund Burke (quoted by Thomas Carlyle in 1841). Burke referred to the three estates of Parliament and the Reporter's Gallery as the Fourth Estate.

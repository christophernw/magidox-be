usually spelt "flipping 'eck" or flipping heck.....don;t know where the flipping comes from but the Heck is a derivative of 'Hecate' -  a she devil type - referred to in Shakespeare. . flipping heck these days means - "oh no"..."I don't believe it"...it's a very very mild term usually used in agreement...not as a "f off" type of word...... . regionally still gets used in the nth of england a lot!

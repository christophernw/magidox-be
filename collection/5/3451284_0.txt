The Titanic had three operational stacks and one for cosmetics.  At the time a four stacker was considered to look more important than a three stacker.  Possibly because an odd number, looks .... odd.  So, the first three, going from the bow back, were working stacks, with the last stack providing a little period eye-candy.

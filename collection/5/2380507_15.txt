Perhaps they shed light on a very difficult subject. No converts, either way, will be made here...but I see some VERY un-Christian writing here by supposed Christians. I see a great amount of judgement being made, when God has said, "Judge not lest ye be judged." It would seem to me, as a casual visitor to this section, that perhaps if Christians practiced more of what they preach, Atheists would feel less compelled to point out the failures that are so prominently displayed here, day after day. IT is the same question I will ask of many of you...why do you answer so many questions in the Gay/Bisexual  area when the only comments made are negative???? Did anyone ask for your opinion on being Gay? NO....Questions here, and in all areas of this site, deserve a real answer, not stupid, nasty remarks.

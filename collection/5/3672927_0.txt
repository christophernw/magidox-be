Globalization is the process where peoples lives, either through business or personal means, becomes entangles with the lives of those in various parts of the world.. . For example:  People used to grow thier own food, sew their own clothes, ect.. . Now, we buy pineapples from Hawaii and almond chicken from China and clothes from Kenya and everything from everywhere in between.  As the world becomes more globalized, we rely on more people for more, and everything becomes interconnected.

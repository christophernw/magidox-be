The economically-less advantaged (that's political correct speech for drunken, homeless bums) in our town swore by the pint of Nikolai vodka.  You can panhandle / beg for enough pocket change to afford this in under thirty minutes, apparently.  Those guys frequented the shop two, three times a day every day easily.  Always asked for the same thing.  "Pint o' Nikolai."  So there you go... enjoy!

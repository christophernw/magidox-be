whats a minor or moderate sex offence? a garandma being raped? a girlfriend being raped? a person being touched or groped without giving consent? its people like you that worry me ya know. how do you know the statistics are false for one? secondly, there is a registery there to protect society. you obviously feel strongly on the matter because of a personal link to it but you have to keep in mind that most sex offenders  will offend again, just like a junkie, just because they have done time for armed robbery or stealing a car doesnt mean they're not going to do it again. the registry is there to protect society. not giving sex offenders a job near or around the thing that tempts them seems a good idea to me. too bad sex is all around us. and personally i dont think theres enough demonizing happening on the subject and i'm sure plenty would agree. these people dont deserve your sympathy.

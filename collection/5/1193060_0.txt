You are describing an underbite or Class 3 occlusion (the Jay Leno look?).  This is common in young children(2-3 years old), but can correct itself when they start to get in their permanent teeth at age 6.  Early orthodontic treatment can be started at age 7, if it is deemed necessary to correct the growth of the jaw.  In the past, before early intervention, ortho was usually done at about 12-13 years old, after all the permanent teeth were erupted, but now they have discovered that with appliances you can help the jaw grow the proper way, at an earlier age.. Good Luck!

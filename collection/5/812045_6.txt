I thought it was the job of the neighbor sitting in the pew directly behind me (get it??? BE-HIND???). When the minister says "Peace of Christ be with you" and instructs the congregation to greet one another I thought that is when they lean forward and fix that thing. Oh wow...Now I feel sorry now for that old lady that I always sat behind.  Oh well, Peace of Christ be with all of us.

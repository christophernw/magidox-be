What do you want done? A magic shield that when the priest goes to touch them he get's zapped? I mean I understand your thought but really what can be done? It doesn't mean that God doesn't care. Have you forgotten that Satan has rule of the Earth. God will be the final Judge. He doesn't effect free-will, which means he can't protect people like that. Realize though that most, if not all, of those priests won't show remorse and therefore will end up in hell.. . iblis that was the CATHOLICS, not the CHRISTIANS. Please get the name of the religion correctly. Not all Christians are Catholic, I for example am not Catholic and have alot against them. I don't blame them though for the choices of a few Priests and Cardinals. Actually it proably goes up to some Bishops but I won't go into the whole degree.

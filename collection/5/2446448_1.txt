depends on the quality of the piano.  good piano keys are made with ivory.  they take a piece of ivory and shave it into the shape of a key while getting as many keys out of the piece as possible.  pianos that aren't high quality just use wood for their keys.  they are manufactured just like pieces of furniture.

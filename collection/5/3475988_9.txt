No, I dont. The problem is many people dont know any blacks or even have a huge black population so when they see a black person they end up judging how blacks are by how that one black person behaves. Also the media, especially movies and TV make it look like all black people like the same things (rap, being a gangster, usually something negative). . . But in the same vein it seems like all white people are expected to apologize for other whites or we are all expected to like all blacks or we are racists. I have had a few black friends early on in my life and a few of them tested me as if they were trying to prove I was a racist (that really annoyed me). Back then I wasn't, but now with all the favoritism going on I have leaned more toward being racist. I dont think this problem will ever go away.

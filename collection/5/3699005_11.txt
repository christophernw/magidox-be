Peach Cobbler is a simple fruit dessert that is fruit on the bottom & a sweet biscuit dough on top (Cobbler is not limited to just peaches, you can use nearly any fruit).  Take a square baking dish, grease it with butter or cooking spray, line the pan with enough peaches (canned or fresh, pitted, sugared) to fill about halfway to 3/4 of the pan, drop a couple of pats of butter on top of the peaches, sprinkle with sugar & your favorite fruit spice(cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, or allspice), make a drop biscuit dough that has sugar & spice(favorite fruit spice) added, put dough on top of peaches & bake in 350-400 degree oven til top is golden brown & peaches are bubbling.  Serve plain or with ice cream.

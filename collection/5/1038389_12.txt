Why are we so jingoistic? In other words, why are we so proud and dominant? Well it's easy when you think about it. We're number one and at this time we do not have any serious rivals to our power. In addition to that, we know that no other country has a standard of living that even comes close to ours (and I purposefully don't count Europe, because most people here live in apartments that are the size of your average single-wide trailer). And whose fuXXing fault is all of this? Ours? Because in the last century, the Europeans murdered each other so long, so brutally and so thoroughly (see World Wars I and II) that their entire political and imperial order broke down, leaving a massive power vacuum that the US stepped in to fill? Because our last major rival, Russia, finally imploded in 1989 after fifty years of imprisioning half the civilized world behind behind an iron curtain and forcing them into state organized collective poverty? What about our current rival, China, a country where the vast majority of the population lives in abject, rice-picking poverty while ten percent modernizes under a communist dictatorship which denies basic rights and puts more of its citizens to death (yes, percentagewise) than anyone else? Look who we're up against!! Of course we get to feeling a little superior from time to time. It's only natural! We're number one and we stand alone in this position. Not only that, we all know that our immigrants came/come here from all corners of the globe, and it's no secret to us why they did/continue to do so.

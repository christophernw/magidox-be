well it had more to do with communal tensions.. . the british followed the policy of divide and rule and had been able to separate the muslims and the hindus.. the war of independence was probably the last time they could successfully unite against the british but that too couldnt last long as they bribed many rulers to support them eventually (the gandhi-jinnah talks in 1944 were a failure and so were the round table conferences and lucknow pact). . now if u think that things could be patched up.. it was too late by then..

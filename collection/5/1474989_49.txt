The reason we die is simple, it's heredity Romans 5:12.  The way people die are varied.  In the case of your friend, she made a bad decision and lost her life.  Ezekiel 18:32 shows us God's view of death. “‘For I do not take any delight in the death of someone dying," Ez 33:11 also, "“I take delight, not in the death of the wicked one, but in that someone wicked turns back from his way and actually keeps living.(if he got another angel, why would he not delight in death?)  1 Corinthians 15:26 death is called our enemy.  Psalm 73 is very helpful because a faithful person almost gave up because the good people seemed to suffer more.  I will say there is nothing in the bible to prove the idea of God taking people because he needs another angel, that's something he never said.  John 5:28,29 and Rom  5:21 remind us of the hope we can have.  Ecclesiastes 9:11 also helps us see why bad thing happen to good people.  You can also look at the account of Job, who caused all those bad thing in his life?  Hope some of this helps.

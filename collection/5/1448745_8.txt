The beaches are definitely better in India.  My family takes a trip every year, two years my parents decided on   India.  I was like wtf, India? From what I've seen on TV, it's horrible.  I was wrong.  The beauty of that county is never protrayed on TV.  The beaches are amazing, hotels are awesome, and night life in Bombay is hott.  . Definitely visit Goa and Juhu beach in Bombay....you'll probably catch a gilmpse of those hot indian actresses.. . Like the other person said, the weather will be rainy.  The best time is dec, jan, feb.

I believe that beta carotene and ascorbic acid are like a silver bullet to many detrimental conditions...this and wheat germ oil can bring positive changes to the human condition as these are all primary antioxidants in their most powerful form...yet when alcohol is introduced into physiology there's a chemical reaction that takes place that's quite unique...this might have a direct opposite effect of the combativeness of free radicals that induce cellular decay...in addition...there are herbological treatments already known that were designed to aid in healing the sick...books on the subject include the herb book, back to Eden, and many other texts...I have studied herbs up close and find that a threefold treatment could have a positive impact...the first would be an antibiotic treatment...the second would deal w/ the nature of the tissue in question...i.e. beneficial throat herbological extracts...the third attacks the illness itself...antibiotic herbs include don quai, garlic, chaparral, and juniper berries...some of these seem to be of moderate toxicity so great caution is advised...nonetheless...other herbs are not...clover...which is a good base for an herbal remedy is quite pleasant actually...there are many herbs...sage, butchers broom, liquorice, snake root, and lobelia are among some....much more can be learned through the above mentioned literature...These types of remedies in the right concourse with good nutrition and vitamin supplements along w/ refrain could be just the thing the doctor ordered...

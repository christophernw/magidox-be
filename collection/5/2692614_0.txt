I think that the Olympic National Park in Washington State is absolutely stunning. There's a rainforest, old growth forest, the Pacific Ocean, Mountains, Native American artifacts, it's somewhat accessible on trails for wheelchairs, 4 lodges, 4 different visitor centers, and 16 campgrounds.. . You can hike, backpack, climb, ski, snowshoe, watch birds, ride horses, and fish.. . And it's beautiful.

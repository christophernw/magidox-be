If you mean in relation to "gnostic gospels," these are gospels which are thought to have belonged to an exclusivist, Christian-type group.  These gospels were not included in the official version of the Bible created by the earliest church and upheld as the only true account of Christ's life and ministry to the present day.  They are called "gnostic" because they were found near the town of Gnosta in Egypt.

I always got those as a kid the my mom use to say keep your fingers out of your eyes alreadybecause I always had my fingers in them.  There's really nothing you can do for them once you have one.  My Mom would make me put a hot rag as hot as I could handle on my eye to help draw it to a head (ill that's so gross) and she'd buy me this medication to put on it all it does is help relieve the itching and what not it was a gooy clear creme I rubbed on my eye it doesn't burn if it gets in the eye either.

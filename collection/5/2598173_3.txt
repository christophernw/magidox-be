Whatever country you live in, you should know that countries language.  Making English the official language would stop some of this bull of making our teachers and employers and employees learn a "second" language to accomodate other people.  As it stands now, some school districts are making teachers and principals learn a second language (spanish) because of communication barriers.  It would require those going to school to know my language.  Which, is, if you really think about it, and quit making it a racial issue, is proper.  If i were to move my family to another country, do you think that country would put signs up in english for me?  NO!  Learn the language and the laws here.  I am tired of changing laws to accomodate people who want only the freedom here, but none of the responsibility!

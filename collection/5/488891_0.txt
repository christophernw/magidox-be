Accept yourself as you are. Appreciate what you already have and be thankful for it. Love others as yourself and be willing to forgive yourself and others for the mistakes made. Do not carry hatred or anger in your heart and do not treat others with those emotions. Take life one day at a time, and live like there is no tommorrow.

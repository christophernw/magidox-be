Most people seem to agree that the divine is infinite, beyond comprehesion.  So why would the divine appear to everyone the same way?  Wouldn't he/she/it appear in the way most likely to achieve the desired affect from whoever he/she/it is dealing with?  Which means it would make perfect sense for different culture and different people to have different views of the divine, and none are any less valid than any other, just more difficult for some people to understand.

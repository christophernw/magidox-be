well...hiccups bother your diaphram, so in order to stop the ...spazzing..haha...you have to do something against it.. . this includes holding your breath as long as you can. dont be weird and only try for ten seconds, that probably wont work. . . biting into a lemon has always worked for a neighbor. dont really know why...i find that the whole breathe thing works.... . i feel sort of funny writing this, considering your hiccups are most likely gone by now...

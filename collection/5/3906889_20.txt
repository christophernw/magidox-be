Nowadays the term pagan means tends to mean religious practices that depart from orthodox Christianity, such as worship or beliefs directed at Nature, goddesses, the moon and stars, and so on.. . It is interesting that originally the word did not have such a negative connotation.  Pagan just meant "rural or country" as opposed to urban.  Christianity was a religion that first grew in urban centers, so the folk religion of country folks was known as "pagan."  Now it means something far different!

Why do you need to come to America illegally?  What about the Mexican, Arab, Asian and European who waited in line, filled out the right forms, paid the right fees, JUMPED THROUGH EVERY GODDAMNED HOOP THE US GOVERNMENT THREW AT THEM, and yet you and other illegal immigrants spit in their face by ignoring the line and cutting right in.  Greed and Corruption are EASY to explain...as they are your answer to the above.  I need an answer as to WHY CERTAIN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FEEL THEY ARE BETTER THAN THE REST AND DON'T HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE?   The problems are BOTH the SYSTEM AND THE MINORITY OF IMMIGRANTS WHO FEEL THEY ARE TOO GOOD FOR IT.  Simple solution:  FIX YOUR HOME COUNTRY...OR WAIT IN LINE.  No, I am not an immigrant and my family has been here (United States) since the 1800's.

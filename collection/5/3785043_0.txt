What is a Bush fan suppose to say... blame it on others? "Clinton... liberal media"... come on... that's all they have.... . Have you looked at the issues surronding Bush... you can't win any kind of debate with those issues... getting into a political debate on the issues being a Bush fan is like boarding the titanic.... . Rillifane... have you read Franken's book... obviously not... the title is trying to be silly using Rush's own style of "debate" (hahaha) against him... it's full of more issues on one page than I've ever seen a conservative use on here...

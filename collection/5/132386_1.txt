AH ..... an aneasthetic Q/A..    Some things that are introduced into our system are metabolised or altered by certain organs..   eg....we swallow a tablet  goes to stomach, gets partially digested and then goes into the blood stream, then to the liver....etc.....   OR...we inject a patient into a vein, the substance goes to the liver to be first metabolised before anywhere else.... ....get it..    There are other things that go through your system and get changed by different organs, broken down, altered and then get treated by other organs in other ways, and then get excreted out, be it by the kidneys into urine, or lungs, via breath.

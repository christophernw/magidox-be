jrbarbe is correct, corrosion is a special form of oxidation. Whereas oxidation can occur everywhere (aging is believed to be caused by oxidation), corrosion (or rust) only occur on metal surfaces. Metal will corrode if exposed to Oxygen for an amoutn of time. Painting metal will cover the metal with another substance, these substance interrupted the oxygen from meeting the metal, thus making it impossible to corrode

I really don't know, but they probably do it because their 'friend' told them to try it..  You see, these people know that they'll get addicted, and end up spending more on heroin and other drugs than what their rent and car payments are, put together!So, what I want to know is why they do what their 'friend' tells them to if they know it ain't good for them? I mean, would they shoot themselves in the head if their 'friend' told them it was 'cool'?

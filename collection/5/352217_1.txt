Use good quality vanilla ice cream and an even better root beer and blend the two until it's thick and creamy.  Drink and enjoy!. . Note- using a really good root beer is important because if you use cheap root beer you have to use a lot to get a good, strong flavor.  Then you just end up with semi-fizzy frothy ice cream.  Yuck!

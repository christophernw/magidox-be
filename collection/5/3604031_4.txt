The earth has a magnetic field.  We all know this.  The reason it exists is to redirect solar radiation.  . Ever take a magnet and hold it under a piece of paper, then pour metal filings onto the paper.  The filings fall into little lines showing the field of magnetic force.  Well, harmful solar radiation, as well as solar flares, and cosmic radiation in general are redirected around the earth by its magnetic field.  Other wise we would all fry due to excessive amounts of radiation.  . . The particles coming from the sun have inertia.  So, they want to come straight line path into the earth.  Instead of bouncing right around the magnetic field and being deflected back into space, some due to inertia come into and interact a bit with the magnetic field and our upper atmosphere creating (in my opinion rather beautiful) displays of another form of electromagnetic radiation:  Light.

Some believe that Bush wanted to go to war to stop Saddam because he was such a terrible dude, along with the belief that Bush wants oil since iraq is full of it. I say it's both but mostly the fact that bush wants more freakin oil. Not to mention he wants more moeny from gas companies and that's way gas prices have gone up so high.

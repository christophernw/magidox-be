It sounds like your pretty open minded so ill open my mind and tell you what i think, or at least what i wonder about, part of me thinks that god was sitting around one day kinda board with what he has on the other side of space (so far away we would never be able to reach it if we wanted to) and he though hmmm lets make one like this, with out that but with a dash of this, then he said hmmm i like that thought so he created a few rough drafts on how he wanted the solar system as we know to look, and then he picked his favorite one to create quite a few differnt forms of life, then he just got board with plants they just kinda sat there so then he thought hmmm maybe ill add animals, so he did and then he got pretty tired of everything living off of nothing put pure instict, because they all searved him regardless thanking them for life, then he desided to make a human and throw in a little bit of temptation to see just exactly what we would do, and a few thousand years later here we are, now keep in mind i do have good bible knowledge, and most of this theory isnt based on biblical scriptures, its just how i think it could of happened, you know when you think about it, we could be the 1034239th planet with active creation on it that god has made, we will never know, but it wouldnt shock me to much :) Its god, he can do pretty much anything he wants to do

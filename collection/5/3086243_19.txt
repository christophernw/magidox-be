are you another girl? i thinking that it the typical "catty" jealousy that girls get. it is sad because i thought that women grew out of this and they dont. it still goes on. i even see it started in my daughter's age group, she is 9.. anyway the best thing is to ignore it and just be as professional as you can be. also another thing to keep in mind, is this job really worth it? you were looking for a job when you got this one. i mean really, if is a summer job, you can get another i am sure. good luck

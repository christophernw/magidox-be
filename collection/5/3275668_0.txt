First transmitted on BBC One in 1978, this "play with music" tells the story of Arthur Parker. A "cowardly and dishonest" sheet-music salesman in 1930s Britain, Arthur has a a fistful of dreams and an eye for the ladies. Frustrated by his frigid wife and cynical shopkeepers, he looks to a desperate romance and his inner-life to reach the fantasy world of songs.

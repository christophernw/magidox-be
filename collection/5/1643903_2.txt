It's just an automatic response from the body to deal with an onslaught of more virus/bacteria on the nasal area. From the point of view of the body, it is very effective. When the number of invaders reaches a certain point that it's unmanageable, the body will resort to one of its tactics to kick out the existing bugs and prevent more from coming. Notice that usually a runny nose is accompanied or followed but many other symptoms. It's part of a routine flushing because the body is being taken over.. In many people this whole system can overreact when not necessary; it's as if the body was paranoid. That would be an allergy.

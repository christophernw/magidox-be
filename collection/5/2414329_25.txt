I've noticed the questions that seem to get the most answers are the ones that don't requie any actual knowledge but require an opinion or an answer drawn from the person's experience.. . Questions about math, science, legal troubles, or other questions that are less "what do you think" or "what should I do" require a level of familiarity most people on the site don't have and often get far less serious answers.

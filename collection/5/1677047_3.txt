There are many people that suffer this and mostly from your body producing lots of oils especially on your face. I reccomend that you slow down on fried foods and start eating regular meals daily...low fat.. Drink lots of water everyday. Drink drink and drink some more. When your body begins to purge out all your toxins, your face will clear up too!

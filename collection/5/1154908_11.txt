In my humble opinion and personal experience, the black man is hated because he is a black man that can rise against oppression. as much as people would like to believe it doesn't, racism still exist, the 60's weren't that long ago. so you are going to have people who don't like the fact that people with the most unique skin tones can excel and prosper at young ages or otherwise combating the struggle that we once had.

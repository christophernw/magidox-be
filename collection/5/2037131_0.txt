The notion of separating clients from servers, though, provided programmers a great service. No longer were they tied to the resources of a single machine for the accomplishment of their tasks. Resources and implementations could be moved to the computer that best accomplished the task. In fact, as database applications grew in complexity, it became apparent that multiple classes of servers would be needed.. . Relational databases implemented the ability to perform processing so that database administrators could implement data integrity rules. Triggers and stored procedures began to look like small programs in their own right. At some point, it became obvious that databases were implementing more processing than was strictly necessary for data integrity. They were implementing business rules: units of processing or algorithms that represent some concept of importance to the organization using the database. This might consist of how discounts are calculated, for example.

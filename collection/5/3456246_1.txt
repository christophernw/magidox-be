You do not use a cork or bobber with a spinner.  It is meant to always stay in motion, so constantly reel it in...not too fast, but, to attract attention, give it an occasional tug or jerk to change the motion and aggravate the fish.  Unless you are using a very light spinner in very deep water, you do not need any added weight.  Try the Mepps Aglia for good spinner lure action.

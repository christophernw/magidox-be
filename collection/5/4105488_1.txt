A blueprint is, conceptually, a plan or design documenting an architecture or an engineering design. While this may be as simple as a quick sketch or outline using pencil and paper, a blueprint is traditionally reflected as the contact printing process of cyanotype. It is cyanotype which produces the familiar white lines on blue background. The term is often used metaphorically to mean any detailed plan.

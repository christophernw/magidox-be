Your son was made truly special by God. It can be difficult for you acceptin that he is homosexual, but remember that he needs to feel that you still love him, because of whom he is, his sexual orientations, doesnt change the bone that connects you both. If you are having problems acceptin his homosexuality it would be good if you talk with an specialist (psychologist) or join a group of parents with gay children. Any of them could help you come closer and understand more the feelings of your son.

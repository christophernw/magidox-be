If they come over legally, they have to pay alot of money that they usually don't have. The majority that do come over illegally pay the amounts needed to become legal citizens after they have had a chance to establish themselves and save some money for them and thier families back in the home countries. Yes thier are many who NEVER establish themselves and make the good ones look just as bad as themselves.

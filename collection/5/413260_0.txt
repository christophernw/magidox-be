Because when you eat sheep it's called mutton.. . Mutton tends to be rather tough and chewy unless boiled in stew for quite a while. Adult sheep tend to be more productive to the farmer, producing one - or often two - lambs per year for slaughter plus wool. So the price of two tender lambs plus the wool exceeds the price of one chewy mutton... thus it's more economic to sell lambs as meat rather than mutton.

You are having a refractorry error (not defective vision)called "Hypermetropia"or "far vision".It occurs because your eyes are very slightly smaller in size than the perfect normal size.You are more hypermetropic on left  side.To look concentratedly at a single object the lens in your left eye has to stretch less and right lens more.This strain (unequal in both eyes)is more than when both eyes have same refracrory error.(called ANISOMETROPIA).If it is particularly difficult  CONTACT LENS used fot both eyes ELIMINATE the stress.Before you get proper prescription and training about contact lens,please use one eye at a time by rotation..Using one eye causes difficulty in depth perception like when you climb down steps more than one step looks as though they are on the same plane.(while climbing down steps you have to use both eyes .)While reading and writing illuminate the room more to lessen strain..Your condition is not serious but troublesome.If you neglect it for a  long time you will "involuntarily"use only one eye( without your knowing it ) and that may cause "divergent squint"of disused eye.

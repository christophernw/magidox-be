I think a little WAR 101 is needed here. . The Geneva Convention is the place and time where war rules were set in stone and agreed upon by everyone to be honored. . These rules are the universal Bill of rights, if you will. If you ever took a philosophy class you will know that some think that everyone has some BASIC rights. The Geneva convention addresses this and also specifies conduct that is expected during war. . The reason is that WAR by nature is barbaric but we are supposedly "civilized" because of all the new tech toys, inventions, etc. So that the line will not get blurred we are expected to still at in a civilized manner. . Another big reason is that at some point the war will end and if YOU behaved as bad as the loser then where is the difference. So you will be at a moral disadvantage and also will face legal problems. ie. If soldiers raped women, stole art, desecarted the sanctity of a church. . So although the human race accepts that..to date we have not come up with a better way to solve our differences besides war. This primitive behavior can be curtailed by laws that were written to protect innocents and excess force of prisoners. . Basically, 2 wrongs don't make a right. But JUST in case.....we are creating laws so that we can take legal action against you.

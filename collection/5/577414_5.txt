Anyone can use yahoo answers, even the uneducated and the ignorant. . . While annoying, these persons' incorrect spelling and grammar as no affect on our own lives. This is just a tool for entertainment, not a forum for serious academic dialogue. . . But I do think that many youths do not value education as much as they should. Often students get picked on for being "nerds" in high school because they work hard and want to be intelligent. I think the simple fact of the matter is that most of us end up working for the nerdy kid who always worked really hard in school and in life.

Every religion other than Christianity.  Easter is about the re-birth of Christ, therefore any religion that doesn't feature Christ doesn't do Easter; judaism, muslim, buddhism, hindu etc etc. . I would also disagree with the answer above - 'all other religions believe in their existence' as this is untrue - other religions do not believe in their existence as they do not belive in Jesus, therefore his being reborn has no meaning so they don't observe it.. . Also, Jehovah's Witnesses do believe in Easter, the same way as they believe in Christmas.  However, they do not celebrate it in the same way as other Christians do.. Many people who study religion say that early Christians cleverly fitted Easter at a time of year when people were having spring celebrations in order to make the new religion appealing, which may have been what the answer above meant.

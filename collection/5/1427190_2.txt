People across America send in funny home videos to try to win money. The top 3, as picked by the studio audience (supposedly), win money. It's been on for years & years. It was originally hosted by Bob Saget who told the corniest bad jokes through the whole show. I don't know the name of the host now, but as always, the dumbest videos seem to win.

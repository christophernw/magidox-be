it is not a law yet....For example, in Florida, if you have, I believe, over 45% hispanics in your county, they have to provide Spanish computers/forms/or voice translation.  . . I was born in Panama (now a US citizen) - if you vote in Panama (even though lots and lots of people are bilingual) voting is in SPANISH.  English is taught as a 2nd language. Legal documents etc have to be, by law, in SPANISH!  . . Same in other countries - so why should we not expect if people come to the US that they learn ENGLISH - we are epected to do so when we go to other countries?. . Do you know (I do) the procedures to get a VISA to live as a resident in Panama, Florida, Costa Rica, and other countries????   Research it and think about it

Example:  you are eating potato chips, you dip your chip into ranch dip, take a bit of the chip and then dip the chip again into the ranch.  It's unsanitary (unless you are the only one eating the dip).  It just means you dipped the same food twice after taking a bite.  I have a bad double dipping habit when I am the only one eating the dip.

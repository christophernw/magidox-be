mp4 files are not compatible to be archived or zipped while playing. If zipped u have to unzip it every time u want to play it in this way it takes lots more space then it took first I would recommend u to download a real player from net and then a mp4 to rm converter.. u can get it by searching in yahoo.The rm format has less kbs so it takes less space.

In the crib under my diaper and my mom said she heard me moan and when she looked I was all glassy-eyed. . My earliest memory, 3yrs, with the roll of toilet paper I stole from the bathroom for that purpose! I worked it til I got "that special feeling" which is what I called it. Rubbed on the banister for years. Got caught many times by relatives or people walking in on me.

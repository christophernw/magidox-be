well its about treating people and children as humans not as 'observing material'. in order to observe, you are using someone else to get your material, or information and so you could argue that this is not ethically right. the way to be ethical with it is to ask permission, to remain as unobtrusive as possible, not to intrude in what they are doing and to understand and acknowledge the reasons why you are there.. it also depends on why the children are being observed, you might be observing contact between a child and their parent becase there are child protection concerns for that family and so your observation might be part of protection of the child,,, you might be observing because there are educational or social concerns about a child;s behaviour, in which case you need to be careful about how you handle the observation because you dont want to make the child feel that they are doing something wrong,,, you might be observing the children for assignments, in which case the ethical question is more relevant because you are using others to gain for yourself and then you must ask permission etc

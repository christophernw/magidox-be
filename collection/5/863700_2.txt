Don't get all that upset about Bill O'Reilly.  Despite holding a degree in journalism - O'Reilly is NOT a journalist.  He is a "news analyst" - which is completely different.  He is political "entertainment" - much like pro wrestling is sports "entertainment".  His job relies on his ratings - not on any skills he may have as a journalist.  If he loses ratings big time, he'll be gone - just like any old TV show or sitcom.. . It's ENTERTAINMENT - you can ignore him completely without fear that somehow you're missing out on something newsworthy.

Because the catholic church is so fanatical about it's teachings, if someone dares to question the church, it's supporters treat you like the anti-christ.  So if I question the church, and people treat me like I'm the anti-christ simply because I'm questioning church doctrines, then I will become offended and "pick on the catholic church".  I figure if the church can "pick on me" for not believing what they believe in, or not following them blindly, then I can pick right back on them.  Besides, isn't tolerance supposed to be one of the church's doctrines?

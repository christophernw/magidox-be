Because they are fat lazy and stupid and they don't take the blame for anything in any aspect of their lives.  You are right, no one MADE them eat 15 chicken sandwiches and drink a gallon of soda!. My boyfriend once owned a small truck with a cap.  He was walking out to his car in a  parking lot when he noticed it was moving back and forth.  As he neared the rear of the truck he could hear grunting and groaning.  He peered around the side of the truck to find a rotund obese woman who had somehow wedged her fat body between his truck and the car next to it.  She jerked back and forth trying to free herself, and as she finally broke free from her restraints, she left a big dent in his passenger side door.  Needless to say, she didn't own up to it or pay for the repair.

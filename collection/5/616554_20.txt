Well, if the illegal parents would have some common sense left, they probably would not leave any under age children behind- unless they have legal relatives in the US who  can take care of them until such time that they can legally fend for themselves. We can not absolutely reunify american children with their parents based on act of goodwill,  but to allow immigration process  takes its course: to petition the parents when that child reach legal age and financially able to support his parents.

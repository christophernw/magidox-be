Oil is changed for the following reasons:. . 1. Oil in the oil sump which travelled approx. 7500-10000 KMS has withstanded extreme high temperatures, splashing, turbulence, Thermal Shocks (When you drive engine it becomes hot and when you park its temperature start cooling down.....and so on a contnous cycle keeps on going).. . 2. Due to the above cycles, certain chemical changes take place in the oil which starts turning it acidic. . . 3. It starts losing its viscocity which is very important for a good lubrication between the moving parts.. . 4. Low viscocity means higher wear of the moving engine parts.. . 5. Higher wear of the parts mean one has to be ready for higher maintenance & repair costs.. . So, a change of the oil brings back the same viscocity of the oil required for that particular temperature (like cold countries, warm countries...has different viscocities...20W40, 20W50 & so on). An oil recomended for a cold country will seize the engine if used by a vehicle owner in the warm country).. . This enhance the engine life....hence we change the engine oil.

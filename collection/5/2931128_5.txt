So easy to forget that trees, vegetation and shrubbery are alive. Who created the vegetation? It feeds on ground water and sunlight. In other words, to say we are descendant from monkeys, then we could say we are descendants from vegetations. After all, an oak tree is aive and vibrant. You cut a tree down, chances are it will grow back. It's tough. Unless you think the so-called single cell created everything from vegetation to animal kingdoms. Don't think so. That's why monkeys hang out in trees. They want to show evolutionists the close bond between the vegetation and animal kingdoms. So if you think your wondering about us and monkeys, you could also wonder about us and vegetation.

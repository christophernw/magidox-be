my daughter was caught drinking at a party and she was able to go through teen court. she got some community serv, had to go to three AA meetings and had to stay out of trouble. she did everything she was suppose to do and it was over with. it was not put on her record. she did not loose her license. also, in most states, your juvenile record is closed when you turn 18, depending on the charge probably.

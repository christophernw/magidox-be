I use to have a tungsten with the same problem.  I looked the problem up but unfortunately have not come up with any solutions.  I suggest that if it is still under warranty, then you should contact Palm and they might be able to get you a new one. . .  Also you can wait a few years.  In a few years the sound will be there, but you just wont be able to hear it.  Studies show that high-pitched frequency noises cannot be heard by older people.  Youngsters can hear it the most...Good luck! :-]

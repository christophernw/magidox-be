Thunders occur when cold air suddenly encounters and mixes with hot air.. . Try this to see for yourself, at your own risk and with adult supervision if you are a child.. . Place water in a pan and bring to boil.. . Get a soda can, cut the top and put ice with cold water in it.. . With a salad grabber or a similar instrument, place the cold can inside the boiling water.. . LOUD HEY!. . Thats how thundering sounds occur.

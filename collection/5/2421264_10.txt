This question has been answered to a good level of satisfaction by most of the other people who have provided answers, so I would only like to illustrate with an example: Look at an equation that comprises fission of a U235 or Plutonium atom into smaller atoms and particles. Add up the masses of the resultant atoms and particles and subtract this sum from the original atomic mass of the fissile isotope (Uranium or Plutonium, depending on your example fission equation found on google). This difference would give you the amount of mass that has been converted into energy: Find this energy by using E = mc^2. This is the energy produced by the fission of the fissile isotope, and manifests primarily as the kinetic energy of the resultant atoms - at a macroscopic level, this is what produces 70% of France's electrical power, as also the utter devastation caused by a nuclear bomb.

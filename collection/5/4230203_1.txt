Well... your phyche has to reside somewhere, right?  So that means that you have to have a physical anchor to your personality or psychology.  That is what the brain and the rest of the nervous system would be.. . It is fairly important to find out which area of the brain is responsible for critical thinking, memory, senses, and other information.  This would allow you to determine if a particular syndrome is "physical" in nature, meaning caused by imbalances or trauma.  . . For example, we would have a certain chemical or hormone called endorphins.  This is the natural painkiller.  The absence of this substance could cause a person to become erratically angry or upset (sometimes to the point of rage).. . Trying to analyze a person without looking at the possible brain/nervous disorders would provide only half the picture.. . Although the actual connection of the personality to the nervous system has yet to be established (meaning the location of the soul or anima), it could prove useful someday.

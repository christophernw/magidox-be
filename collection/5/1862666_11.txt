I have read quite a bit of it actually.  Lots of action in it.  Killing children, selling people into slavery. It even has a section telling you what you must do if you rape a woman.. . Nice book. Ever wonder just how many people god has killed? I mean, killing children for the sins of their parents? That's kind of evil isnt it?. . Q~

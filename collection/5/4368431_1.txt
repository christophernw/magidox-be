at any store such as target or walmart, you can buy mini nozzles to put on the end of your water hose. but be careful and turn it on slowly at first (unless you want to get sprayed!) and gradually make it faster. make sure the water balloon is on the nozzle completely when you think it is full enough turn the hose off!

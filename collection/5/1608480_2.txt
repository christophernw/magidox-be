Sometimes you just have to say "f--k It".Maybe college isn't for you.Here's what to do.. I an very serious about this I did this in 1963 November and was so focused that our crew did not know until three days later that JFK (Bless His Soul) had been shot.. .       Get a job on a sail boat (Like wind jammer cruises) they are easy to find and you need no experience.All you need to do is be able to pull a rope swing a mop,hold a paint brush (got the idea)You can find these boats in places like Miami,Los Angles,San Diego etc.Some travel all over the world.Do this for one year. Minimum wage but all you can eat and a roof over your head.I was on a boat called the True Love that still charters today.Search Schooner True Love and you will see what I'm talking about.I sailed from new york to st Thomas worked a year and sailed back.When your done you will have a WORLD of experience(maybe not be able to sleep on something that's not moving for awhile) Then go back to college and you will not fail.There's something about the sea that puts you one with yourself.If this is not your cup of tea start walking across the USA you cannot fail in putting one foot in front of the other.Remember the mot important part though.Don't forget to just say "F--k IT".One of my bosses I had for twenty years told me one day "You know what I like about you Wackydac?" "you just say F--K IT"

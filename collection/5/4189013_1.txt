I've never been able to watch someone suffer and feel or do nothing. Myself, on the other hand - sure. Life wasn't much fun for me as a teenager. I didn't have great contol of my emotions, so the only way I could get a handle on them was to just block them off. I remember having a major fight with my mum some while after I started doing this (I would've been about 16, I think), and I cried. Then I got out a pen and paper and wrote about what a weird experience it was to cry, as if I was watching someone else do it, and getting the feelings second-hand.

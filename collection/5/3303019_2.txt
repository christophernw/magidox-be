My cat does that every night ~ it is like his bedtime routine.  I go to bed and lay down and it is as if he is checking the bed and making sure everything is okay before he settles down to sleep at my knees.  I think he feels like he is protecting me if he checks everything out first.  It usually takes him 5 minutes and then he lays down. [personally, I think it is kind of cute]

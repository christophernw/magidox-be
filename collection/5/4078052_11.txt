The solar calendar is 12 is hardly a "male dominated" calendar, even if we were to assume that all sun deities are male, or all moon deities are female (Amatarasu the Japanese sun goddess, or Teccuciztecatl, the Aztec moon god, for example). The reason why there are 12 months in the European solar calendar is because the months roughly follow the cycle of the moon. If the inventors of the "male dominated" solar calendar didn't care about the feminine moon, they would have based their months on something else.. . To address the actual question, however, 13 is only unlucky in certain cultures. Each culture has their own ideas on what numbers are lucky or unlucky, based on things attributed to that number. Apparently, it wasn't even considered unlucky in Christianity at first. Try this link:. . http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_080.html. . For a little less sarcastic reading, I suggest this link, it's part of a larger article about why Friday the 13th is considered unlucky, but this part focuses on the number 13, so it might lend some insight to your question.. . http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/historical/a/friday_the_13th_2.htm. . A good example of cultures that saw the number 13 as a good thing would be the Aztec and Maya, but Shepen already gave a good explanation as to why that is.

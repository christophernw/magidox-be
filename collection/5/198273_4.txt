I usually wrap gift cards like a present--complete with mini bows and ribbons.  I have seen cute little stuffed animals that hold the card.  I also use little stockings (you can usually get them for like 50 cents) and put some candy in there and stuff the gift card on top.  Or, to tease my boyfriend, I will put a giftcard in a large box--its funny, but you have to make sure the person has a sense of humor!  Don't bother buying the gift card holders--there's such a waste of money and you could make something cuter.

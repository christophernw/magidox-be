Game 1: . . Try copying different objects and scenes onto acetates (clear plastic, used for Overhead Projector slides, available from stationery or office supply shops'.. . The acetates can be taped together in pairs, to make pictures that combine different images. If they are taped to a window, light shining through the images will help to blend them.. . The kids can trace parts of the pictures and transfer them to a paper page, then colour them with the same idea in mind (ie. colours you like rather than those you saw); Several combined images could be used as sources for each painting.. . Game 2:. . Collect some objects, with contrasting properties, and pass them round. . . Each child starts with an object, but only draws a part of it (perhaps time limited) before passing it on to the next. Each object circulates around the table until it gets back to where it started.. . (a second or third round can be added, using different objects, according to the mood of the kids). . Again, the colours can be added in the same style (remember to have plenty of spare brushes - the kids WILL forget to circulate some with the paints).. . Game 3: . . The PAPER circulates, with each child adding some line, some colour, some tone or some marks, from observation of a still-life set. More pieces of paper can be used than children in the group, either by 'feeding in' new sheets at a particular point around the table , or by holding several 'rounds', with a different 'starter' for each.. . After a while of this, each child can choose a piece to 'adopt', and add to until it is finished. The additions can be made from the same set, or from a second one.

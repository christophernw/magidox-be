Raelianism. . It's a fairly new religion and I understand that it is still forming, but so far a lot of what it talks about is more focused on building a landing pad for alien vessels than it does on focusing on spiritual life or much else (although it does have an interesting theory of how we got here, etc). I'm sure it will develop as time goes on, but right now it seems a bit ludicrous.

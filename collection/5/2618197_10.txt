There were many reasons for the second World War.  The main reason was probably the personality of Hitler.  He was a merciless dictator.  He had the absurd belief that the German race was superior and he wanted to create an Empire that should last for the next 1000 years. He came to power at a time, when Germany went through a difficult phase.  That was firstly economically (recession) and also politically.  Democracy in Germany was not really stable yet as it was a new system.  This means that there was actually chaos and instability in government.  This made it possible for Hitler to come into power.  Secondly, the German people had been under a very strict legislation and war settlement from the previous World war.  This made them feel suppressed and therefore susceptible to take revenge and fight back.  Another reason for the 2nd WW, was that the other European countries did not realize what a menace Hitler really was.  They were therefore too soft with him in the beginning and only realized what was going on when it was too late.

from the owners side training is very expensive so it is considered great when someone already is at least partially trained or experienced.  To show someone that you really want to work and are worth that time and money expense you need to be able to show them that you are very hard working and reliable even before you necessarily get an interview.  Giving a resume in person to the person who is hiring is a huge help it lets you show them that you want to work even if the paper you hand them only has school and hobbies to let them know a little about who you are.  To be willing to work any hours any where just to get a foot in the door can lead to contacts and possible far more interesting opportunities

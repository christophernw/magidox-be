You are assuming that predistination means that God has a definate plan for you. You think that God micromanages and one wrong split second decision on our part puts us outside of His destined will. . . Wrong. . . The predistination is that God choses us to be  his children. We have freedom of choice. . . Think of your life as a circle ...with an entry point and an exit point. Because God is not restriced by our earthly time he is above us and he sees our whole circle of life before we actually live it.  His intention is that we chose well and live our life with freedom of choices, yet his desire is that we chose to trust Him and give our Hearts to Him. . . I we are puppets then there is no freedom and also we can add, why would a loving all pure Creator let there be pain and trials in our lives. We have such tirals becasue  of our freedom of choices. Even the earth is in distress. . . Because of freedom of choice there are bad things that happen.

dog hair falls out its natural...thats why they dont need hair cuts,they shed when their hair is too long..oh and try and give it a bath once a week and use dog shampoo...by doing so it well shed less..washing more than once a week leads to sheding because its bad for there skin/hair;not washing enough leads to shedding and is bad for their skin as well...so once a week and your dog will be fine. . . and it may be growing its adult coat of hair??

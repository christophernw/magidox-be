I don't believe all Blacks are "mad" at Whites. They don't like the rich b*tches at the top manipulating life in favor of themselves and their close ones while cra*ping on the rest of the world. . . I'm sure there are plenty who carry animosity towards Whites in general although I'm not sure "mad" is the right term. I would say disillusionment is probably the root of the phenomenon. I feel it, as well. Before immigrating to this country, I had an (almost) mythological vision of america, land of the free, where everyone is equal, etc.. . I have found otherwise. In America, everyone is equal but, some are more equal than others. Especiallt those who can afford to be more equal. . . To put it another way, "The Great White Father promises much but, only delivers if you can afford to pay him.". . After the assasination of Martin Luther King Jr., the disillusionment set in, I believe. A lot of hope was lost because he was a great man who could have done a lot for both Blacks and poor people, in general. Much of the dream died with Mr. King. Yet, the power structure which put an end to Mr. King's life remains in power.

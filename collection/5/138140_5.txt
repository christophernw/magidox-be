i own a repair shop,and if the car isn't locked you can take the passengers side door lock out of it,and it has a number on it they can make a key off of it that will work for it,other wise it might be easier and cheaper just to call a good lock smith to get it done,and have two sets made  this time good luck,i hope this help,s.

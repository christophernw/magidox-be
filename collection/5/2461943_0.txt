Find the root of her hatred toward you and your husband and squash the beef!  She must have a problem with you for some reason or another so she will continue lying until whatever it is that is bothering her is settled.  You could file a complaint against her for harassing you and possibly get a restraining order against her.  Whatever you do, don't retaliate, they won't cuff your husband without serious proof of wrong-doing.

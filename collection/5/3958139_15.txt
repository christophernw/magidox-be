Though I woudn't class myself as a TRUE atheist, I don't feel depressed at all.  Sure, life gets tough sometimes, but I KNOW with every fiber of my being that I will get through the tough times and things will get better.. . But I have a nice house, a great job, a loving wife of 10 years, I'm in very good health, have a lot of hobbies that I enjoy and can share with my spouse, few financial troubles and a good outlook on life.  I've achieved it all under my own power with no assistance from "higher up" and will continue to seek, learn and improve myself until I die.  . . What's to be depressed about?

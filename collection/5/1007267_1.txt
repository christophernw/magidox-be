I am Praying. Christ said in Matthew 9:22: "Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole." 9:20:"He was speaking the woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment: 9:21:"For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole." 9:22: "But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy Faith hath made thee whole." And the woman was made whole from that hour.". Prayer is the way we touch Jesus Christ, therefore Pray. . . I would recommend that that you read the King James version of the Bible. It contains the answers to your questions.. God the Father knew you before you we born in eternity past and when you were formed in your mother womb. We are born with a Soul that will live for eternity. We must decide as a free will agent to accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior or not.. Our decision determines whether we spend eternity in Heaven or Hell.. I Pray that you make the right decision.. Jesus Christ Loves You.. God Bless you is my prayer.. David

Good Question!. There is an aspect of you that is Perfect.. Another that is Pure but not perfect.. And the last is an aspect that is imperfect and needs work to become one with its original pure and perfect aspect.. So in essence you, the same as anyone else, are perfect but you also have the capacity to make choices. Once you have choices and make decisions you create your life second after second which can make this imperfect aspect of you closer or further away from your perfect essence.. Don't believe anything you hear, use your discrimination and research for yourself into the matter.

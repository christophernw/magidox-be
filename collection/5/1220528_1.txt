CAMP LEJEUNE, NORTH CAROLINA.  The food was better in Iraq.  The chow halls were within walking distance of the personel.  There was working air conditioners in Iraq.  I live in a condemmed building, with mold growing on the ceiling.  The mold is so bad, that it is a health issue.  I'm trying to go back to Iraq.  There's no Taco Bell, but the living and working conditions were better.  For a town that wouldn't exist w/o the Marine Corps, there aren't many options of things to do, unless you like expensive strip clubs with fat strippers or Wal Mart.

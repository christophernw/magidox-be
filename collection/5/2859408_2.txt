Depends on your tootache and what you have in your medicine cabinet. If it's a dry socket nothing but hard Lortab will help you I'm afraid(personal experience).  Try Orajel(benzocaine) on the area, 2 extra strength Tylenol every 4 hours or 600-800mg ibuprofen(Motrin) every 6-8 hours.. . Bummer nothing hurts quite like a toothache.  Hope u feel better soon. :D

God is good at sharing, Evil is good at injustice.  The opposite of God is not Evil, it is "not-sharing."  The opposite of Evil is "injustice."  God encompasses matter and concepts.  Evil encompasses concepts only, and lacks matter.. . Observing the first and utmost God's attribute of its matter, "light" seems to be the logical and universal choice.  God said: "Let there be light!"  And that's when he started "sharing" his light.  Evil is superficial since it lacks "matter."  God's light extends to eternity and as it shines outward it captures nothingness.. . Could Evil exist in nothingness (God's to be had), if it has no place (matter) to exist on?  Could Evil that is created by human's mind exist in nothingness?  Could it be that if human eliminated the Evil in his mind, more estate would be added to the God's estate, and human light would help God's light penetrate even more into nothingness?. . Perhaps that's why Evil is associated with darkness, it's the darkness in humans that springs from injustice.

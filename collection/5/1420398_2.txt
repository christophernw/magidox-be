I am NOT Trying to be funny or make fun of you, but have someone check you just to make sure you did not pick up headlice from somehwere. That does not mean you are a dirty person or anything like that, so don't be embarrassed or think that I am saying something mean to you. That happened to me when I was a kid, my head just itched to no ends, one day it was discovered that I had headlice. . . Another thing you might want to check for is Ringworm. Again it doesn't mean you are dirty , anyone can contract it for other people . . If that is not the case, then what I would recommend is finding a shampoo that has tea tree or malealuca oil in it. . . Aussie and Paul Mitchell are both excellent products. Paul Mitchell is more expensive, but it will last you forever and it really is good, it has PURE tea Tree oil in it. You use only enough maybe a dime sized circle and you use it a few times a week. . . I hope you start to feeling better.

Be carefull w it. Years ago, I had a friend that proud himself w the fact that his doberman  dog chased cats and  even he  said his cat killed a few. I thought that was mean, and I felt bad, He would not listen to my  begging to stop it..  One day, I saw him walking his dog in a park, on a leash. When I got to say hey...he told me the terrible  news. His dog cornered an alley cat, and the cat jumped on the dogs' face and left him blind. The cat used its 4 paws to scrath the dogs face. The cat run away..   He cried, he was so sorry , and asked me to forgive him because I told him about  the dangers before hand. .   Be very carefull w cats, specially w your  little dog. A cat, specially a feral or intact cat ( not neutered) will fight like a lion.

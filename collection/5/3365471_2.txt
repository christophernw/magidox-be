Could you defend your statement with some facts or examples of how certain electronics contribute to thousands of deaths daily? I don't understand what exactly you are referring to.. . People are exploited all over the world, unfortunately. Diamonds are mined by peoplewhich are practially slaves.. . Rugs are made by little children in foreign countries that get paid little to nothing.. . The leather products you wear probably came from some Turkish laborer that must subject himself to deplorable conditions.. . Your underwear was most likely made in some sweat shop in Afghanistan or Guatemala.. . . The keyboard you used to type this question probably has been put together by many hands of Mexicans or Orientals that are payed less than living wage.. . . What are we to do? We don't have many options when it comes to purchasing products. So many products are produced overseas and so little American made products are available to us.. . Wal-Mart for example has fruit cocktail that comes from China.<--That was the last straw for me. Years ago when I saw that on their shelf, I decided to boycott the store. And still do to this day.  . . Don't blame the consumer, blame the corporations.. . When someone starts holding them accountable, maybe then they will opt not to contribute to humanitarian crisis' around the world. That is not likely to happen since the love is money IS the root of all evil.

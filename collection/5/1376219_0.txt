Mash potatoes, lay them on the meat and use a fork to score criss cross all over the top. Lightly sprinkle salt over the potatoes and put ino a very hot oven 220 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes. The more butter in the potatoes, the browner and crispier they will be. For even crispier potatoes crush a bag of ready salted crisps (potato chips) and sprinkle on top before cooking.

Since 100% would be 4.0, the answer is simple. Divide 3.07 by 4.0 which = 76.75%, and then divide 2.35 by 4.0 which is 58.75%. While you can multiply both your GPA and cumulative GPA by four 4 to get the same answers, the way I have shown you will allow to find the percentage of anything from the total possible, which is to divide your score achieved by the total possible. If 27 were possible and you attained a score of 23 then your percentage would be 85.2% (rounded up). Try it with a calculator first then soon you'll be the person everyone turns to and asks: what percentage does my score equal?

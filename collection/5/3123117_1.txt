Not exactly sure about the model, but most watches have a small indented button on side of watch. Press the button and another button that will move the numbers till you reach alarm function, you will see a flashing bar or bell push button till it is gone and your done or hold the 2 buttons on right side of watch and you will hear a beep-announcing it has turned off.. You will see either 3 little bars or a bell pic above the numbers.  Hope that helps

I had similar issues when my braces were removed in July.   With my braces I avoided eating meat (in the form of steaks and jerky).   After I got my braces off I enjoyed steak pretty often.  ligaments, tendons and crap from the meat would work its way between my teeth and stuck in there).   . . I would just floss after you eat... better yet use a water pik to make sure no meat (or "meat by product") is stuck back there.. . Water pik is awesome for gum health.. . Hope this helps.

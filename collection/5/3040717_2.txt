They know you are nervous.  Just pant like a puppy. Go for it.. The person when you go in will give you tips if you ask first.. Stop at stop signs, pull out slowly.  Watch your speed and ask before you start what the speed limit is there.. Use your signals. Even before you pull out.  Turn that signal on to show you are going to move.. The HARDEST part is the written test.. You already know how to drive.

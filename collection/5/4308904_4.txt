Stopping is easier then not starting again.. These worked for me (not in this order). . Assembly of God worked (I was & am not of that faith)(two years)(some one was smart and must have been praying for me not to start again I had so really smoke myself through the illness of it). . Cold turkey worked (one year). . Lots of ice-cold water and the gum for 1 month(2 years). . Pre- surgery (2 years). . Thought I was pregnant(4 years). . Wellbutrin (1 year). . These all helped to stop. . . I am staying stopped by not thinking that I can have just one (they are an emotional supressant and as addicting as opiates and caffiene, unlike other drugs, these change the way your body works so you must now go against your basic need to smoke)

First of all in order to advertise they would have to remove large chunks of any religion(Christianity in particular as it contradicts itself MANY times) , and then, since advertisements dumb everything down to save time and to state a position they would have to simplify the religion so people of all backgrounds and persuasions could swallow it. By that time you'd have a bunch of idiots running around who thought they knew the "truth" willing to kill people in the name of a God they don't understand. Personally , I have never liked religions that claim they are for everybody,there are some people who use religion as a crutch and are emotionally-imbalanced and NO god is going to help that at all. I like religions that are HARD to study as this leads to a deeper understanding of life in general when you find the answer for yourself.

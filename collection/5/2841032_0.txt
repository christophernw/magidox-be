War is actually good for an economy because it creates manufacturing jobs and more.  Meanwhile, war is bad for other gov't agencies because money meant for them will only get diverted to lube the war machine while in motion.. . Lastly war is TERRIBLY BAD because it cost lives and creates misery everywhere it touches.

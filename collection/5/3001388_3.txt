There is a long process to get into the US legally, but it is there for a reason.   It filters out those who are trying to come here for terrorist purposes (some of those who took part in 9/11 walked across the Mexican border) and it also limits the rate of immigration.   . . All these illegals are a burden to the economy.   People who cross illegally are LAZY and should be declared felons and taken back!!!!   Our border needs more security!

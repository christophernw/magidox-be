well from my point of view, . . 1st in economic point of view,. Japan has the strongest economic(GPA) in Asia now. China is fast growing but it still has a very low GPA in asia. . 2nd in political point of view. Japan is practising open democracy where evryone has freedom of speech. China is praticising communism and the points of view of people are mainly censored (only political party is playing a gimic). . 3rd in social point of view. Japanese people are known to have high moral values among its citizens. Chinese also have high morals but only among a low percentage of their people has it...(in china)

I think it is due more to emotions. . . When you feels angry, you will find that you will be breathing more deeply and your hearthbeat will beat faster. In science, the blood pressure also increases. . . I think raising the voice if just one of the many ways to let the emotions out. Some people shout out loud just to let their emotions come out and not staying in the heart. Some also talk to other people too.

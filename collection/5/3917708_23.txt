My 11th grade AP US History teacher. This a true story.... . The day I walk into her class I am bombarded by blatently partisan posters. I won't tell you weather they were liberal or conservative, but they were definately politically charged. The posters used cathy phrases that implied that my political party wanted murder anyone who did not agree with it. I was offended. I talked to my mom about it, then we agreed to talk to my teacher. I asked her to take the posters down, but she called it "freedom of speech". I said freedom of speech must be balanced by respect for other students opinions. She wouldn't listen to me, and then accused my Mom of threatening her, which my Mom didn't do. We talked to the principal, and he agreed with us. He told us she would take the posters down immediately. Six months later she still had them up. Throughout the semester she made obvious disses on my party, accusing them of dirty politics and indifference towards the problems of America. Finally, she removed her offensive posters, and then put up a new poster that said "diolouge is preferable to censorship". I can assure you that if I had worn a shirt to school that said "(people who belong to my teacher's party) want to murder you" I would have been asked to remove it. But because my school is so biased towards one side of the political spectrum, everyone thought it was okay for a teacher to be one sided.. Oh yeah, and at the end of the year she gave me an assignment that was worth a gajillion points. She always let us turn in assignments a day late without penalty, but when I tried to do that she wouldn't accept it. I almost got a B at the end of the semester when I had had an A the whole year long.. Note to teachers: DON'T BE PARTISAN!

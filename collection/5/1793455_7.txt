I have never heard that deoderant or wearing bras cause breast cancer, take a look at this site . . if this were true then the incidence of breast cancer would be sky high and women would be walking around with unsupported boods and smelly arm pits. . With regards to the nipple problem, have you tried those self addeshive bras.

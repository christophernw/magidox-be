Yes you are right!!!. Indian women as a wives have all the right to abuse thier Husabnds and thier family including mother, sister , even kill them , through them out of house and forget any punihsment , there is no small warning for that.. At least in India there is no right for men , any any dispute whatever may be the reason , the husabnd have to pay the price, let his wivfe be a third grade criminal.. That is the reality.. Indian women want to take the facility of 21st century , but refuse to take the responsibility of 21st century.. They want all the whole sale free lincence , that is the problem.. Till date indian women will not belive be self supported and indian parents does not give the equall right to thier daughter , the real women empowerment will never come.. Presently in India in the name of women empowerment , only legal terrorism is going on.

I was involved in the Iraq thing for a little while and tried to see the picture as a whole.  Take the names out of the question you asked; Bush, judeo-christian, Muslim, and what are you left with?  This group of people hating that group of people.  You are probably thinking Christians vs. Muslims.  But it is deeper than that.  Did the problem that world is facing today exist before the time of Christ?  Yes.  War has been apart of the world since the beginning of it's existence.  Human nature?  No.  It's mother nature or the World's nature.  Humans are not the only thing on this planet to engage in combat against other creatures.  In my opinion if there is a way to "stop" WW III it would only be for a short period against the inevitable.  Maybe even making the outcome worse.  War is a part of nature and to stop it is to stop the natural path of the world.

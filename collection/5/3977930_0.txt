I used to sell tvs for Circuit City and i can say the top three brands are Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba. that is the best clarity and definition of your auidio/video equipment. you definately want to get a high definition television preferably one with a built in tuner this will make it easier for you to get high def programs. so you don't have to buy your own tuner (with a high def. monitor) when you get a high def tv with built in tuner be sure to upgrade the cable to hook stuff up with and your dvd player to a high def or progressive scan dvd player and always take consideration in the extended service plan nomatter where you buy it on a big screen if one color gun goes out you could be out 350 dollars and the plans are usually sheaper than that for in home sevice for 4-5 years i hope this helps you in chosing if not i am sorry but i always told my customer you get what you pay for and in a large invetment like a tv buy one that will last and look great the enitre time you have it.

"Men Are From Mars - Women Are From Venus" is a good place to start, but it's simplified pop psychology. There are much better books out there. . . Two that come to mind are "Standup Guy: Masculinity That Works" by Michael Segell and the unfortunately titled but absolutely OUTSTANDING book about communication between men and women, "All Men Are Jerks (Until Proven Otherwise)" by Daylle Deanna Schwartz.  . . Both go a long way toward explaining the complexities of each gender's perspective and why they do AND say the things they do and say.

You were probably in some fashion abused as a child. Your feelings of worth, unchecked will not only reflect upon your life not only now but relationships in the future.  Unchecked and acted upon as time goes by the problem will worsen.  It is your mind, nobody but yours.  It is not an out of control processor unless you wish it so.  You have the controls and the means of analyzing 'why' this happened and to make sure that you do not act out on it.  This is not only your karma but the karma of the perpetrator who you are 'bringing out' to both your detriment.  . . You can do it, if you want to.

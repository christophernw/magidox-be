Eek is right about a stiffening batten usually being wood on a typical muslin style or luan flat but there are other types.  In soft drop baroque period productions such as at the Royal Theater at Drottninghoelm in Sweden, or for stage productions that are trying to evoke specifically old time theatrical design techniques that use drops or painted cycloramas, battens are made out of netting to hold leaf and cutouts in place.  These pieces of netting, if not part of a the fuller netting supporting the drop are netting stiffening battens.  So stiffening battens can be made of softer materials if the design and visuals call for it.

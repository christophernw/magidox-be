The can taste is not completely true...... I did an experiment at work.... I put a beer can and a pop can in some acid.... let it sit over night came back the next day to find inside that can there is a thin plastic liner that prevents the liquid from touching the metal...... . But I agree it does taste a lot better from a glass bottle... But the bad part is where I live chances of finding the glass bottle are very slim.

The internet has had a two fold effect.. . 1. It has made information more readily available. I don't know any libraries that are open 24/7.. . 2. It has made students look for the easy way. It's easier to obtain answers when others will do the work for you. Look around here. Where's the first place you ran?. . My kids want to use a calculating device. I tell them no. What are you going to do when you're at work and the power goes out to your calculating device and your boss wants a set of figures computed? If you don't learn how to do it longhand, you're fired.. Calculating devices are for convenience not for learning. Sure they're faster and easier but what are you learning?. You're learning how to enter figures NOT how to solve the problem.. . The net effect of the internet has been to dumb down our future.

A perpetual motion machine would be like filing up the gas tank of your car and driving forever.  Of course you must neglect wind resistance, road resistance, friction in every bearing and moving part and the loss of heat from the engine.  It is an ideal that never works.  I understand that the US Patent Office will not accept applications for perpetual motion machines; because there is absolutely no scientific basis for them.  Even the moon orbiting about the earth uses up some of its energy to produce our tides and is slowly moving away from the earth.

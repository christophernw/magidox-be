The same way that a human creates his own problems by his  neglect, laziness, or bad judgement...and then once he makes a conscious effort to solve his problems, he can do it. Just look at celebrities like Deion Sanders, who had great careers, had some huge personal problems, and then regained success again. The Federal Reserve Board set the interest rates in DC (formerly headed by Alan Greenspan) based on how much money there is in the economy and how much people are buying/saving/borrowing/needing to payback. When people go into debt, they eventually stop spending so that they can get out of debt. The market is just a collection of people who have money or are in debt.

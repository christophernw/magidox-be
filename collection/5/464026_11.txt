I am cynical and don't think we can.  I don't think we ever will.  Men are hardwired to oppress and connive, and women have learned to connive and manipulate as a survival tactic.  Peace between the sexes will depend on 1) men stopping the bull___, and then 2) women forgiving and trusting them.  . . After the long legacy in mankind of men taking advantage of women, and especially after these very dark past twenty or so years with men in America basically treating women like garbage, the first option might be possible but I think the second one is a pipe dream.. . By 2020 women will NEVER trust men again.  That's a fact.

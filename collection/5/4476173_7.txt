Hello,my friend went to therapy today to help take care of this problem.They told her that she had injured her knee cap and that it was free floating wrong.So she has to have return visits for appx. 6 weeks.Yesterday she had just plain therapy,today she had the electrodes hooked up...don't mean to scare you but...with the sounds of what you have been told by the other people...each answer is different,I would go see a Dr.,Tamra Z.

A gnostic believes that god is "knowable", and an agnostic believe that god is not knowable/has no knowledge about a god.. . Agnosticism does not lie between atheism and theism, it is separate. Atheism and theism form a universal set (ie encompass all people, everyone is either an atheist or a theist). Theists believe there is a god, atheists are people who aren't theists, they lack that belief. There is nothing in between, you either believe there is a god, or you don't.. . Agnostics are people who have no knowledge of a god. I imagine this usually goes along with atheism, people have no knowledge of a god and thus lack belief in a god, and so they are agnostic atheists (or atheistic agnostics if you prefer it that way around). I have met some people who say they have no knowledge that a god exists, but believe anyway (because they want it to be true maybe, I don't know). These people are agnostic theists.. . Personally I'm an agnostic atheist. I have never experienced or perceived a god in any way and thus lack any knowledge of a god, and since I can't believe in something I have no knowledge of I lack belief in a god too.

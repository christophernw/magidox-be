Life is a multi-faceted concept. Life may refer to the ongoing process of which living things are a part, the period between the conception (or a point at which the entity can be considered to be an individualized being) and death of an organism, the condition of an entity that has been born (or reached the point in its existence at which it can be established to be alive) and has yet to die, and that which makes a living thing alive.

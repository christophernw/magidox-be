Best way I know is what my mum taught me - go and look in a mirror. If you can accept the person that you see - flaws and all - it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks of you. . The only stupid things are the bullies (I went through it as a kid myself). If you can start believing again that you are a great person, then you will meet people who feel the same way about you. So what if you're not like them - your uniqueness is what makes you you. Besides, it seems you've come to the right place for a confidence boost. . Hope this helps.. . W

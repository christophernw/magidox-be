In the sea, there are plants which naturally oxygenate the water. In a tank, this is difficult to accomplish so you need to hardware to accomplish this. Otherwise your fish will get sick and eventually die. As for a thermometer, i think this is less important if you have your tank inside the house but some fish probably do better at certain temperature ranges.

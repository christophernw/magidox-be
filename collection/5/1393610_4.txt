Hoover couldnt and didnt want to do anything b/c he didnt know what to do and he wasnt that great of a president in the first place. FDR had social programs to get people back to work and on their feet and he also had educational programs so that helped. The only thing that really got us out of the depression is WWII b/c it fueled the economy. If the government had been watching and regulating the stock market and the economy during the 1920's then we wouldnt have had a depression in the first place

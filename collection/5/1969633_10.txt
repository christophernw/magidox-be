Well the only way the world will survive, or at least last a lot longer is that all mankind, either die, or leave the place because it's us that's causing it's death.. However we should live to enjoy life, be happy and send out your love to all, and pray that one day we all see sense, and stop using guns, drugs, and all the things that make the air bad, learn to live and work togeather for a better life for ourselves, and the world, but with so many filled with hate, and greed it will take a long time for ALL of us to change.

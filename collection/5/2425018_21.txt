Firstly to get to heaven is the simplest and the hardest thing to do at the same time, it is doing to others what you want them to do you.. And secondly, after Jesus said this in Mathew10, he said that he who works is worthy of the price of his work(unfortunately I don't remember exact place to say where it is).. And thirdly it's better not to read than read only the places you want to argue about.Because Bible is the book where evryone can find words they like or dislike.So one needs to be the holy father to read it propely.But it doesn't mean that we shouldn't read it.We should but under the supervision of orthodox fathers.

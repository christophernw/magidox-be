I know what it does when it hit me.. It chemically adjusted the cells in my body. . I know what it is like to be dead a few times, they keep kicking me back here.. I know what it is like to be hurt badly.. I know what is like to be raped.. I know what it is like to be lied too.. I know what it is like to be used and abused in many forms.. I know That I trust . I know that I love. . I know I am here to give hope to others.. I know what it is like to be in a plane that is hit, but you have to ask how strong was the hit as that comes into it. Some does not register alot others can do much damage.. I have not given up hope on the world. Just sometimes people. But then I take the person for who they are. Sill...

I don't know about your country, but can't you suspend activity for a year? Solve all your problems and then go back to college, with renewed forces...i have been loosing years because of my depression and anxiety...at this point, i don't really know what to do but  i recognize i should have stoped for a while to solve those problems...we can talk if you like...best luck for you

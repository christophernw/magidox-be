Excellent answers y'all got!  :-). . Cuz everyone wants everyone else to agree with them.  That is called "validation".  People like to be told that they are on the "right path", or is right about an issue.  . . And when they meet someone who is on a different path, or disagrees with them about something (usually politics and religion), sometimes that scares them a bit.  It might make them think "Am I really right?  Am I really on the right path in life?  Might I be wrong about this issue?". . Fear of differences.  Extreme desire of being validated by others who agree with them.  Being in the right group.  That does tend to make some of us turn overly judgemental when things go sour.  . . Don't let them get to you, sweets.  Life is too short.  *hug*

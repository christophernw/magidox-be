scratching post and keep it's nails short, most scratching is to maintain their nails. But some trimmers with a gaurd at the store, if your kitty will let you touch it's paws its quite easy. I do NOT recommend declawing, it's inhumane in my opinion. Most people don't know what declawing really consists of, it is cutting the last digit of their 'fingers' off, you wouldn't like the last digits of your fingers cut off.. . trimming works. so do soft claws

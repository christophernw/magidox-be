I really like C.S. Lewis' explanation of that one.  Ok, I can't find the book, so I can't tell you (yet) from which one it came.  I will look more later after work (I'm already running late).  But briefly summed up, C.S. Lewis compared it to the Atlantic Ocean and a map of the ocean.  Experiencing it first-hand is the only way to go, but if you ever really want to navigate it and see other parts of it you need a map in order not to get lost.  God is our experience, and theology is the map to experiencing him better and more fully.. . Sorry for such a short answer; I will add more later today!!

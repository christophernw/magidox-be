We do not insist upon it, but I might put forth this argument, because we are the worlds super power, for now, it is our duty to make sure that the world is to be held at bay from self-destruction as long as we can.  After all when we used the atom bomb we thus became the keepers of the bomb, it is our fate to keep the world safe and we must.  . . If not, then we have failed mankind, and the world will enter into a darkness that will take thousands of years to recover.  If at then.  . . Our problems at home will be resolved only as we bring the rest of the world into the 21st century.  It is imperative that this happen, we are no longer just nations upon the deep blue oceans, we are just stepping stones in a lake.  Those stones must learn to keep the ripples from becoming tidal waves so that we may co-exist together in a world more peaceful.

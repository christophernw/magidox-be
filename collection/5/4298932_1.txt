Since potential jurors are obtained from voter registration lists, the best way to avoid being called for jury duty would be to not register to vote. I am not advising that you do that, but none the less, that is probably the best way. You could always become a convicted felon, but that would be a terrible solution. Then there was the guy that said " prove to me that he's not guilty ", that got him excused real fast. Then there is the fact that many jurors are not aware of, and that is that a juror can judge the law as well as the facts of the case. Judges do not like you to be aware of that. If the judge knows you are aware of that, that might get you excused. I do not recommend ticking off a judge in your own county, not a good idea. Judging from some of the nit wits I have seen on jurys, if you have half a brain, do us a favor and be a jurer.

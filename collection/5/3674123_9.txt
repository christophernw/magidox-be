It's not abuse if you do not feed your dog when you want & it refuses, eventually it will learn to fend for itself & take what's offered which will always & ONLY be in the bowl. After awhile it will know that the only place it's allowed to eat, is in it's own dog bowl. You have to be patient though! It's not considered "starving it" if the food is there, but they won't eat it. Your dog has been spoiled that's all, so don't give in!!!

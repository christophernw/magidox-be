I,d say as soon as people started doing the bravery thing.I for one cant see why people get REWARDS for doing natural deeds.IF you are on the spot YOU will do the BRAVE thing for sure ,NO thinking about it.ITS NOT the person who does the DEED its some other NO HOPER GROUP which WANTS to get IN on the HIGHLIGHT. just for the GLORY and being on the STAGE.WHO knows they may even get PAID money for running the GROUP. BUT then I,m a cinic.. POLITICIANS just LOVE handing out AWARDS..

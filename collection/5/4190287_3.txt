Switching schools is depressing because you have to start from the  beginning to get to know students, teachers, administrators with their quirks, attitudes and routines.. . Nothing is done the way you are use to it being done. You are always being corrected. No one wants to hear how you did it back, where-you-came-from!. . You are the new kid in school, class, town or perhaps heaven forbid all  of the above. Some people have very limited lives and that makes them overly interested in yours until someone new walks onto their little stage. Meanwhile you may feel like the new class hamster that bites off it's new babies heads because the children won't stop poking, prodding, picking and touching.. . You'll make friends, move back to where-you-came-from, (It won't be the same.) become one of them and someone else will become the class hamster.. . Meanwhile, smile, be polite, don't scream or cry, this to shall pass.

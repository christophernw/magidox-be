anybody can drink in a pub if your old enough and of you arn;t you can have soft drinks, as for smoking, I am a smoker, and we have a designated smoking area, but this summer all smoking will be banned as in Ireland, alot of pubs are considering large outside heater/lights so that people can sit outside in the winter, but quite honestly when they ban smoking in the pub I shall give up, because as it is I smoke outside the back door coz nobody else in the house smokes! and I wish somebody could tell me exactly how much money I have wasted over 25 years! it doesn,t bear thinking about, so if you don.t already smoke. don't start and if you do try and give up, you don't sound old, pack it in and buy some cd's instead, much better idea!

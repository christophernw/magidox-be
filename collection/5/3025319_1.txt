Hold your breath, or maybe glass of water like someone else said.  What I know some people do (including me) think of the people that might be thinking of you, and say the name out loud...sometimes it works, and you actually stop hiccuping after you say someone's name.  Worked on me a few times, and ALWAYS works on my friend, lol.

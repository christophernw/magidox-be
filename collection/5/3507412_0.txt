good question i did many when i was doing them they come out easy but it has a charge in it a static charge will deploy it , and their is a sticker on the back that will tell you this device will cause death if handled improperly, there is a two yellow wires and disconnecting the battery will not mater but disconnect anyway, it has a power coil in the car the bag can deploy up to 45 minutes even if battery disconnected OK when its removed the part that would normally face you in the car turn it around and make always face away from you and put it on a bench or something face up do not face down OK if it deploys it will be a rocket, it uses ammonia sulfate its a chemical that burns and expands very rapidly well as fast as a air bag deploys OK never hold it close to you and if you ever seen the way it packaged you will understand why, they do not transport these thing by air only train and land cause they can cause horrific problems be very careful screws behind the bag removes the and you are suppose to have a license to do this i seen a guy in a shop that was careless and it deployed he grounded it the yellowy wire and broke two ribs broke his nose two black eyes and had to have his ear put back on they are not a toy

In simple terms it is a physical phenomenon in which water in a solid state (ice) converts straight to gaseous (water vapor)state i.e., skips the liquid state. How do you acheive it? Example: Freeze-drying or lyophilization technique. where you freeze the solution, pull adequate vacuum and drive the moisture as water vapor in a controlled manner. Hope it helps!

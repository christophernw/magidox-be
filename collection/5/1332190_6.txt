Most water pumps have a small hole in the casting directly above or (more common) below where the input shaft runs through the water pump. This hole in the casting is called a weep hole. A small amount of anti-freeze may be seen leaking from this weep hole. If it is the pump is bad. Water pumps may also squeek or chader (audio noise). The easiest way to find this type of failure is to remove the water pump drive belt and turn the water pump by hand to see if the water pump bearing turns freely. A water pump should turn with very little resistance and very smoothly.

Sancerre is a town in central France on the Loire River.  The wine made from the Sauvignon Blance and Pinot Noir grapes grown there is also called Sancerre.. . But perhaps you are asking about the derivation of the name of the town.  There is a theory that since there was an ancient Roman temple dedicated to Julius Caesar in Sancerre, perhaps the town was first referred to as "the place holy to Caesar" (saint à César), later Christianized to "Saint-Cerre," and still later, elided to "Sancerre."

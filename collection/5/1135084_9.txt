It's an unfortunate reaction that a lot of people have when being told that they are going to burn in hell, that they worship Satan, and that they are a sinner for not accepting another person's faith. I am a pagan and I rarely get told that, so I tend to be more positive towards Christians. . . My advice: Ask the next person who attempts to bash you or your beliefs what they believe and why they believe it. Then actually listen. They aren't trying to convert you, and can't force you to be whatever religion they are, so you have nothing to loose and only understanding to gain. Additionally you can bet that pagans know about your religion and sometimes more than you do, so if they know about you and you don't know about them where does that put you in a debate?

push harder on the accelerator, when you are in a high gear.. . if that doesnt work pehaps try purchasing a more powerful car, or go to your local garage and see how much it would cost to make it more powerful.. . sometimes i find a service can give an older car a wee boost as well  hope this helps and good luck with the car

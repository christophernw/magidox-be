It is one of two reasons.. The US goverment is to stubborn and tight-@ssed to changed over to the metric system which is used by the rest of the world, no matter how much more logical the metric system is, because they feel that it feels that it would be seen as a sign of weakness.. . OR, it is a conspiracy devised by the US government to frustrate all foreigners in the US taking Physics classes, or wondering what the temperature is etc. Maybe, if the airplane controls had not been in metric as well, 9-11 would never had happened!! :D

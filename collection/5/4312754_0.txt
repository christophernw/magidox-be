Losing weight slowly is the best option. You're doing a lot of damage to your heart by crash dieting. Being over weight is better for your heart than the dieting!  You have to be moderate.. . Sounds to me like you may have low blood-sugar attacks, which will make you dizzy. Try eating some carbs which your body will use slowly (the sugar, that is).  Going on a low-carb diet can be risky if you're at risk for having low blood sugar. You should talk to your doctor about it; they can put you on an appropriate diet that won't be harmful. . . One good step is to cut back on dairy products, and replace them with soy products. Soymilk, especially the chocolate, is delicious! And good for you ... full of protein. Also, eat the hell out of fresh fruits and veggies (steam them if you prefer), and cut back on butter. Use the butter sprinkles instead. Limit the amount of salty, fried foods  you take in (french fries, chips, etc). But don't forget that your body needs fat!  Good fats come from nuts, avacodoes, etc. Don't go crazy with them, but eat them moderately. Your liver will thank you! . . Don't get so carried away with losing weight that you damage your organs. You'll be sorry. Drink lots of water, eat sensibly, and stay active. Good luck!

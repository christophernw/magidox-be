Do not use peroxide either, it damages the skin along with killing the infection do it leaves you open to a fungal infection. Medical grade Tea Tree oil or antibiotics with Tea tree oil in them will get the infection out. I used this ti cure a MRSA infection when nothing else would work, Tea Tree oil is also good for the skin and promotes healing.

The red spotted ant mimic spider, like all spiders, possesses venom glands, and is predatory, however its venom is not dangerous to humans.. . I'm not sure why they're actually called ant mimics, since they don't look much like an ant to me.  They look like a pretty black spider with a red stripe down the back of its abdomen to me.

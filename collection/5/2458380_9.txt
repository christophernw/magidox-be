crystal methaphine is a drug which increases your heart rate and the way you see things. it keeps you awake for longer than should be allowed and it gives you a (supposed)great high. It makes your mind work triple time and is very bad for your heart and your brain. People use it because it is cheaper and easier to get then some of the harder drugs. That is what I hear and have seen on programs about it anyway. If you do decide to try it (which I do not reccomend make sure you know the person you are getting it fom and be in a safe enviroment while doing it. Not in a club or in a strange place.

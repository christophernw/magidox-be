Some models in addition utilize compressed air to atomize  the water.  Most though simply utilize fogging high pressure mist into freezing air.  Collision in the air of two streams of water is another means of breaking the water into small dropletts which will freeze before hitting the ground, this actually requires less energy on the parts of the electric pumps ie lower pressure and higher volume of flow.

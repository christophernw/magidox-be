you have to have hair follicles to grow hair...youmay be lacking them there as a result of a genetic condition....see a dermatologist to see if that is the problem (if you have success elsewhere on your face)...you may qualify for a 'flap' to move skin around that has follicles if it really a cosmetic burden for you.

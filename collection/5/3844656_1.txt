A company like walmart is non union, so you will not get good benefits, nor will you get good pay. what is the use to make 30 dollars an our and you don't get medical insurance, which will cost you about 400 dollars a month for a small family; and you end up with no income when you retire. Also, lets say that you do get the above salary and you end up sick; will will be broke in one week if you don't have medical.

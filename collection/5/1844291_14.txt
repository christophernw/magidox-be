Because we are not able to live for hundreds of years,which is what it would take to get to the nearest star for interstellar travel.If we could figure out how to freeze ourselves for the trip,then it may work.But the other problem with that is the feeding of our bodies.So it really is a large problem to travel through interstellar space.Hope i helped you out a bit.

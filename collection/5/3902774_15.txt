Petitions are hard work & very time consuming.  You could make several petitions & take them to local businesses & ask them if they could show it to their customers. Take one to work with several blank pages for signatures.. . Or....you can do what I do.  Email your state Senators frequently to discuss issues & voice complaints. In Iowa, I go to Iowa Senators.gov. Once their emails pop up, add it to your list of favorites & take time out weekly, or daily, to have your voice heard.

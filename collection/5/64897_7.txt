One of the benefits is you instantly have a network of friends who will help you out of obligation and loyalty. For example if your car breaks down on the highway and you don't have a road assistance membership to call or you don't have a cell phone to call for help-etc if you are a freemason all you have to do is stand on the shoulder of the highway and face oncoming traffic and give the signal. That is a secret gesture that is recognizable to all other freemasons worldwide. Any free mason passing must stop and give you assistance even if it means missing a flight etc. If you are in trouble legally a fellow free mason who is a lawyer will give you legal help as you need it etc. A free mason must put his 'family' above his real family. If you divulge any secrets you will be severely punished so you have to be able to keep very heavy secrets even if it is against the law. It is the biggest cult worldwide and I don't advise you to join. By the way part of the initiation is testing your bravery and one of the tests is sleeping in a box with corpses in a dark room.

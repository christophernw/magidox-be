Unfortunately, I think we're heading in that direction with all the laws and rules we're creating each and every single day to "save us from ourselves".  Our police force is out of control, putting up road blocks, checking our papers such as license, registration, insurance cards - sound familiar?  Our state officials are making laws for us that affect our everyday lives "without our being able to vote on it" - sound familiar?  Our history shows that we fought hard for our freedoms, and the attitude today is that we must be controlled for our own good.  We need to push back a little.  I believe that to live in a free society, we need to accept some bad things happening now and then.  Our choices and our morals should be our OWN to determine, not our government's choice.

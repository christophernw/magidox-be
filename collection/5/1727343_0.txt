Because the major sense organs of vertebrates (smell, hearing/balance, and sight) are paired; we are bilateral animals. The embryo starts with two olfactive capsules at its front end, which develop according to the species, but are usually separated by a septum that represents the contact between both capsules. Even dolphins, although they appear to have one nostril (the hole on top  of their heads) have two channels separated by a septum, and only the external opening is single.

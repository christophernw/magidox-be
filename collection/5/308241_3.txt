The insurance company is supposed to pay you comparable to Kelley Blue Book Value for your car.  Unfortunately, if the KBBV is only $500 then that may be all you get unless you go to court and sue them.  Check around, get online at http://www.kbb.com and do some research.  If it appears that they are trying to short change you then call a lawyer and get their opinion on where you can go from there.. . Good luck!!

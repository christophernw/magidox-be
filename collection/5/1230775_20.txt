I agree with Brenda, Sarah, Carmella & Reese. Anyway, most of the countries you mentioned are living under poverty and therefore will be harder for them to implement a good quality of education. I also suggest you to separate religion and the social culture of a country. . . Islam as a religion is encouraging everybody (male & female) to obtain good education:. . " To seek knowledge is a sacred duty, it is obligatory on every Muslim, male and female. The first word revealed of the Qurâ€™an was "Iqra" READ! Seek knowledge! Educate yourselves! Be educated.. . Surah Al-Zumr, ayah 9 reveals: "Are those equal, those who know and those who do not know?" Surah Al-Baqarah, ayah 269 reveals: "Allah grants wisdom to whom He pleases and to whom wisdom is granted indeed he receives an overflowing benefit.". . BTW, if you would like to throw statistic, I will be grateful if you could provide us with the source.

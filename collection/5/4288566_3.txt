Jesus held women in very high esteem -- much higher esteem than the society in which He lived held women, that's for sure!. . In many ways, Jesus treated women with an equality that was unheard of in His earthly time and place -- He befriended them, talked to them as equals, ate and drank with them.  . . All of these things would have been considered very scandalous in that society, which very much saw women as second-class citizens.. . Yet, though He had every opportunity to do so, and though He treated women with unheard-of esteem and respect ... He didn't choose any for the role of sacramental ministry.  . . In other words, He didn't choose any women to be among the group of first priests/bishops, the apostles -- even though He treated women as equals to men in virtually every other way. . . Shortly after, it was Christianity -- more than any other religion or institution in human society -- which began to pave the way for equality for women.  . . "Husbands, love your wives," St. Paul wrote, and this sounds like it goes without saying for us -- but to people back then, this was radical stuff!

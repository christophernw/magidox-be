We have so much available to us in the modern world.  That said, why do we need to raise torture and kill others to survive.  Humanity should have evolved to the point that we realize that it's wrong to harm another creature to satisfy a desire for meat.  We raise young beings who never know freedom so that we can send them to a slaughter house so that they can be packages up and sent to your grocery store.  How can we expect to advance morally and give up the slaughter of our sisters and brothers if we don't give up the slaughter of creatures we deem to be 'beneath' us.

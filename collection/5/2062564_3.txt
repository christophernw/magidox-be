Your friend is the one that smells or is it in her house?. . If she smells she simply should stop smoking.  I know that it sounds easy, but I understand from some of my own friends that to quit is really hard.  I know one lady at school that smells like an ashtray.  Just talking to her makes me gag.  I've known a few people who really stink when they smoke.  Your friend may be one of those.  . . If the smell is in her house use febreeze or odoban.. . Good luck with the odor.

Sounds like your clutch is either: a) going out and has the tendency to grab at a particular point in the clutch release, or, b) you have a warped clutch plate that likewise is grabbing rather than softly engaging.  Either way, you probably need to have a mechanic evaluate and probably replace the clutch pressure plate, disc and throw-out bearing.  Make sure your flywheel surface is machined.  Now here is another thought...does your clutch have a cable system or a hydraulic system.  That may be the culprit.  Have a mechanic evaluate it!

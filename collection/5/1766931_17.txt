A colonoscope is run up through the rectum and up into the colon, (also called the large intestine.) It has a fibreoptic scope which has its own light source and the fiber optics line can bend internal light. The machine allows a gastroenterologist to examine the colon walls, for abnormal growths, cell pockets etc.. An endoscop is a fiberoptic tube that can be threaded down natural body conduits to view internal walls or tissues. It also has fiberoptic lines and can have tiny operating tools to cut and collect tissue samples for retrieval and later study (e.g. culturing, or microscopic examination.. They are used to examine the esophagus and stomach. . But they can, also, be threaded through incisions to study internal body parts such as under the knee cap (patella), and/or the cruciate ligaments of the knee.. They are also used in microsurgery. Microsurgery is replacing standard surgery for many operations. Because the incisions are tiny and only the affected organ-portion is worked on. For example, microscopic work can be done through the use of endoscopes and tools attached thereto to remove gall bladders , kidney stones, etc.leaving a one inch (or smaller), incision. Recovery time is dramatically reduced, much quicker than conventional surgery, scars are smaller, less anesthesia is needed, (sometime only local instead af general),  etc.. Dan The Answers-Man.

Boy this is like looking at me in the past. You need to go to your family doctor and discuss this sounds very much like anorexia or bulemia either way it gets out of hand way too fast to ignore. PLEASE TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR THEY CAN HELP. IT IS A PSYCHOLOGIAL DISORDER AS WELL AS PHYSICAL YOU CAN"T FIX IT ON YOUR OWN

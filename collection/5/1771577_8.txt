Salt and pepper are not in every single dish made by a "cook" or a chef.  They are probably the two most commonly used spices, however, because they are a mild form of seasoning that enhances flavor of a very wide variety of foods.  They typically do not have any distinct taste that is could be unpleasant or strong to a lot of people(when used in moderation), unlike garlic or mustard seed. So pretty much, they taste good and can be used on a lot of food! :)

It depends on the type of case.   If it is criminal,  the government is required to assign you an attorney (contact the local Legal Aid office).   If it is a civil trial,  wrongful death, property damage, accident, insurance, etc.  where a cash judgement  for you is a real possibility for you,  you can ask an attorney to work for you on "Contingency".  This means if you are awarded a monetary judgement, then the attorney would take a percentage of your award (usually 20-30%).

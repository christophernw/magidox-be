Depends on the object. If you want to find the cube of a glass marble, you get 27 identical marbles and arrange 9 of them in a 3x3 square on a table, then add another layer of marbles arranged in a 3x3 square on top of the first layer, and finally a third identical layer on top of the other two. You then have a cube of marbles.. . If you want to find the cube of a house or an elephant, you have a more difficult problem.

HERPANACINE, nature's answer to viral and bacterial skin eruptions, was the brainchild of Dr. Wayne Diamond. As unique as it is effective, HERPANACINE is used as an aid in treating all forms of herpes, acne (all types), dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, pustular conditions, boils, and other chronic skin soreness, itching, conditions and inflammations, and it has been on the market since 1990.

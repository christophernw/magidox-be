I just stopped believing.  I question everything, and while I listen to other people's ideas (if they are intellgent ideas and not just condemning me to an imaginary hell) to gain better knowledge for my own arguments, I take them with a grain of salt.. . I share my thoughts with people that want to hear them, but I don't shove them down their throats, as I would not want it shoved down mine.. . Finally, I have never been happier in my life now that I'm an atheist.  I have a husband, a daughter, a dog, a house, two cars, two jobs...basically everything I need.  I get the most satisfaction when someone says, "Aren't you unhappy?  Aren't you missing something in your life?". . My answer is no...I have a fuller life that most of my Christian friends.  I have never been happier, and I am glad I chose the path that I did when I woke up at the age of 17.

If you want God to come into your house...you've got to be willing to go into His.. . I've read the answers of others, and quite frankly those who say you don't need to go because you'll be brainwashed etc., are 'not' of God...and they don't know Jesus either. . . They only think they know him. ( One reason they call it the kingdom of darkness, is because those that are in it...don't even know that they're in it!). . Why do we go to church?  To ' WORSHIP' GOD! . . Many say it's not fun or very enjoyable. Here's the news:. . It's  NOT SUPPOSED TO BE PLEASING TO YOU...BUT IT IS PLEASING TO GOD! That's where the merit is.. . You will never find true peace or have a true relationship with Jesus apart from church. ( If someone tells you differently, they're lying!) Living a christian life is 'tough'...and you can't do it alone. We all need help, and we get that from others who share our faith. . . So when times get tough and you're feeling lonely, tired, rejected and need answers...it will be too late. Go NOW and develope a relationship with God. As I said before, if you want God to come into your house...you've got to be willing to go into His.

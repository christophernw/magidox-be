You must repent to God. Telling you have sinned and to. forgive you of all unrighteousness. Then you ask Him to. deliver you and fill you with his holy spirit. You must . read and study the Bible everyday to learn of God and who. He is. There are do and donts in the Word that instructs us. on how to live holy. That's becoming a christian.

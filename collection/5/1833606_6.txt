Mine goes off every seven minutes.  I have often wondered what genius decided on using odd numbers.  What's wrong with 10 minutes?  Or 5, or 15?  I usually set my alarm to allow me to snooze a couple of times, and counting backwards by 7's can be a little tricky!. . I'm hoping someone here works in the alarm clock design industry and can answer this question...Thanks for asking!!

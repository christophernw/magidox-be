Sociologists have trouble with this because they refuse to accept that our sociology is part of our biology.  The underlying reason is that the reproductive goals of parents and offspring (in all sexually reproducing organisms, not just humans) are not the same.  You'd think at first glance that there would be... if your goal is to have grandhildren, doesn't taking care of your children make sense?  BUT each child instinctively wants a disproportionate share of the resuorces.  This is because you have 100% of your own genes, of course, but only share 50% with each parent and each sibling.  Conserving resuorces for future offsrping is important to parents, but not to children.. . Because of this evolutionary theory predicts that children will resist instruction from their parents, and be suspicous of them, especially when it comes to reproductive questions.  And that's exactly what we observe.  Children are much more likely to listen to their peers than to their parents, even if the information is the same or if they know that their parents are more knowledgeable on the topic.

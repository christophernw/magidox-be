tough question to answer. as usual there are two sides to every story. specially when it concerns tele marketers. to be polite yes -- say no thanks, i am not interested and hang up. if you feel like it -- say please do take off the tel. number from your lists, again thanks.. good luck. time is money -- sometimes calls come in when you least are expecting -- it is not their fault but it is not your fault either. the middle ground it to cut it short politely. hope it helps.

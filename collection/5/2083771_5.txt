I would call a vet and talk to them. It sounds like she may be scared of the crate/kennel. You may also want to get something like "get serious" which is a stain, odor and pheromone extractor which will get rid of the traces of pee so maybe she won't smell it in the crate still and keep peeing in it.. P.S. Please be very careful if you use bleach near dogs.

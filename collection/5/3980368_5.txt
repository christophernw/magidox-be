In the world of Jaqueline Suzanne, "dolls" was a slang term for pills (in the real world, I don't think anyone ever used that term).  Watch the movie.  There's a great moment in which a scenery chewing Patty Duke is screaming "I need my dolls!"  Definitely high camp.  Of course, there may be some deeper symbolism at play, but if there is, it escapes me.

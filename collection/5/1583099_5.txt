I believe that the Palestinians are cornered by Isreal in every possible way, that their economic and social well being is threatened by a Political regime with extremely powerful military support.  Having said that though, I feel Israel has the right to exist as a nation and that the Palestinian authority has to come to terms with that.  In what way are the many surrounding Arab countries helping Palestine, besides always pledging solutions in their Pan-Arab summits and not commiting to them.  Where are they in this equation?  I do understand your position though.

The earth can't be upside down.  Its a large ball of matter.  The place where gravity is created is the centre of the earth, so everything on the surface is pulled toward the surface, no matter where on the globe the person is.. . If you are looking at a small globe, there is no gravity in that globe, the only gravity is from the earth itself, so naturally there is an upside down to that globe.  But that's only because its so small compared to the real thing.

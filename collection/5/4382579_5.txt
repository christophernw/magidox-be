Most cans are now made of aluminium, these will not go red rusty as it is a nonferrous metal ( it contains no iron) it's surface when oxidising (going rusty) goes chalky. The steel cans are coated with an alloy , this prevents the cans going rusty and contaminating it's contents. To make it go rusty you could try scratching the surfaces all over and then leave it outside where the elements, ie wind and rain, can react with it

The people and all of the things are attracted and kept from falling off of the Earth by gravity. Gravity makes us get attracted to Earth and keeps pulling us down no matter what. That is why we jump and come down afterwards. On the moon, there is less gravity, and that's why you can jump and stay up for a long time.

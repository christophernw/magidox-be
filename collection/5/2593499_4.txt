That isn't entirely true, but I suppose you could say the majority are...the reason for this is dates back to the beginning of the Democrat Party which began around the Civil War time. Democrats have always leaned for the normal "folk" and at that time African Americans were more in the "normal folk" area. I suppose that has just continued on through generations. Hope I Helped!

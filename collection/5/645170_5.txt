You are part of the Universe. The Universe is part of You. . To understand this concept brings you closer to "self awareness".. . Once you can become aware of your self as a part of the universe......then the concept of the universe being part of you allows the realization that not only are you...you (as a being).....but the energies of the universe reside within you. Your awareness of yourself manifests itself in the reality of your self.. . Many volumes have been written, over the ages, based on this one simple question. . My advise to you is that if you truly seek an answer to your question...research and read.....then and only then can you reach an informed answer to your question.

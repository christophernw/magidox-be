First make sure she can hear properly. Then if she wasn't trained before you got her it's going to take alot of patience and practice. Remember she probably had a different name before you found her now she has to get used to that and you. Next thing to do is get a bunch of keys and while training her if she doesn't listen throw the keys at her she'll get to a point of just hearing the keys jingle she'll obey.

Well, in my experience, I've learned that cats are attracted to either the smell of the tree (if it's real), or the sparkly ornaments & lights. I have a 2 year old cat, and she has never climbed up into our tree, but not all cat owners are so lucky.. Maybe you should try and keep your cat out of that room, or just make sure that all the ornaments & the tree are secure... after all animals deserve to have fun at Christmas too.

I feel that we take our same sex for granted.......I mean a man dont really take good care of a boy and a woman doesnt care well for a girls needs. And these kids sense this so they are attached more towards other sex.. Also girl may want her father more out of curiosity also, since he has a different kind of body, voice etc. that her. Same with a boy.

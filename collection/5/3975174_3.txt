OK here is how I have done it in the past. Fill the tank with a tray of ice cubes, then fill it about 2/3 full of water. Shake it around real good and repeat as needed. When done and take is clean rinse with gas several times then let dry and rinse with gas again.. . This takes care of the rust and debris in the tank and if you have ever put any solid objects in the tank like my kids have you will know how hard they can be to get out. The ice melts and drains right out. Be sure that once you start with the water you do not stop until it is rinsed out with gas as this will promote the rust if you do. If at any point you fell a weak spot in the metal of the tank stop because the tank will not hold up and this could be potentially fatal.

having clear urine is not necasarily a sign of good health. however having dark yellow urine is a sign that you need to drink more water, although some medications cause dark or even discolored urine .the yellow color is a result of the oxidants left over from not only the digestive process but also the metabolization process going on through the entire body...... slightly yellow to medium yellow urine is perfectly normal. if it's dark yellow dont panic right away, just drink more water. and see what that does.

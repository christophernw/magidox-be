I am an alternative medicinal therapist and an ex nurse. You may have internal piles. These are caused by constipation or during pregnancy or having a baby.If it's bright red then I would say that is what it is. Change your diet for a start or you will always have this problem. Get some LEPICOL from the health shop. You are also lacking in friendly bacteria so get some PREBIO 7 from the health shop.Your GP will give you a rectal examination, so be prepared.. .

Not really.  This midterm election was more of a "recall" of the current Senate, and does reflect some mistrust and dislike of the president, since it was his party which lost seats.  However, the presidential election is still two years away, and a lot can change between now and then.  Also, the next presidential race will be a tough call since both parties much put forth a new candidate, as Bush cannot run again.

Why all of you are worried about immigrants? we're living in this Country since very long time ago, we're growing here and before of the late news maybe you're not noticed in all about our presence here.  Every day the news are playing with the citizens about the thematic to speak, 2 weeks ago the illegals, last week the gasoline prices, today the illegals march.  Then? what we're doing is just playing the media-games, we're worried for immigrants but that is not a real hazard.  Like the "who's number 1" says about the Spanish, so what? why not we can speak 2, 3, 4 or more languages? why we cannot learn something different every day? just because we're "not immigrants"? come on!! this is not a kindergarden problem, there is nothing bad if we know more than 1 language, could be better for anybody, as more as you know as better you do. Also, about the food stamps, section 8 and a lot of welfare programs if you go to any medical clinic you can find social workers trying to enroll new people into the welfare program.  Did you know that? When my wife got pregnated we received calls from SSI offering food stamps, section 8 and money.  Of course I didn't take it but just think on this: if you are living just with the minimum wage and you'll have a baby soon, then you receive a call offering you money, food and benefits... why not? is not to take advantage, is just because the system is offering this to you. you don't believe it? just go to any clinic and ask for social services for pregnated womans... you'll be surprised.  Then do not blame illegals, illegals are just taking the gift..

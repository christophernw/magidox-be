IBS is a catch-all term used by medical personnel when they don't know what the problem is.  Get yourself on an "elimination diet".  Learn what that is.  This little space is not big enough to explain, but you may be intolerant to simple, common foods like wheat gluten, dairy foods, etc.  This is not funny.  My best friend of 27 years died of Celiac Disease because the medical system could not agree what the problem was.

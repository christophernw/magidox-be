Avoid popping it, it'll leave a scar. Try Proactive, my mom says it actually works for her (and no, i'm not advertising it.) If you absolutely must pop it, sanitize a thin sewing needle by holding it over a lighter for a few seconds. You may want to numb your pimple with ice first, so it doesn't hurt. Poke the zit and squeeze the puss out until there is no puss left.

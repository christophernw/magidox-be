Detassling corn and helping on my grandparents' farm.. . But we don't know where you live, so it's a bit difficult.  If you want to stay outdoors during the summer, then how about a landscape company?  You could assist in putting in plants, preparing beds, etc.  Another outdoor summer job could be working at a plant nursery.. . If you are more the "I need air conditioning" type of person, then how about a cashier at the grocery store or neighborhood mall, or working in an ice cream store?

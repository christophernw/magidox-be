...doomsday is what people call the day when men's things (apart from God) fall.. We build this great global empire (all empires more or less join) but it's been a world run on imperfection and self interest, so of course it will crash.. It's an unavoidable journey tho, for to have thinking ability is to be able to choose.. so there ya have it, a world made up of everyone's choices (since the beginning) - but if this 'free-will' wasn't allowed to run its course it wouldn't be free will...    Once rationality is endowed, a whole new world (or tree) of possibilities 'came to be' - and we're still a'chewin' on that fruit - the knowing of good from evil - truth from untruth - life from death - For God is Life, aNd he's Perfection.. to move away from perfection is to move away from life.. so Jesus "savior of the world" was sent to check that journey away from life - and so, surprise! the world won't end after all, just man's creation presently blocking God's.. "the lion will eat straw like the ox.. the bear will graze with the cow..". . be blessed..

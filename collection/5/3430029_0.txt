It goes back to the early 19th century and the publication of Noah Webster's dictionary.  The new country was anxious to establish it's separate identity from Great Britain so a spelling reform seemed like a good thing to do.  Noah Webster actually proposed hundreds of changes in spelling, such as vizion for vision, but only a few of the spelling reforms were actually put into practice, color for colour, theater for theatre, dramatize for dramatise, traveling for travelling.

You ask this question now because the US bombed Zarqawi.  The first report of this sort of bombing in a heck of a long time after all you hear about is house-to-house fighting and convoys getting hit by IEDs, then followed up by small arms fire (rifles).. . The fact is, since the invention of the cannon, defenses have been softened up by artillery, whether that be artillery pieces such as howitzers and field guns, or rockets, missiles, or bombs dropped from planes.  Once that is done, the infantry, cavalry and armor go in.  We have had boots on the ground in Iraq for over 3 years now.  Over half a million multinational forces troops have walked on the ground in Iraq, and a good percentage of those have been on foot patrols in some of the most dangerous areas of the country.  So you see Zarqawi gets blown up by a bomb so you take the opportunity to call the MNF cowards?. . You want to know some good questions about certain people being afraid to fight face to face? Ask why terrorists hide amonst the population and wear civilian clothes.  Ask why they detonate IEDs from hidden locations and then run away.  Ask why they drive a car full of explosives into a crowd of kids being given candy and school supplies.  Ask why they drive a pickup with a mortar tube in the back near a base, shoot of a few rounds and high-tail it away.   Ask why they fly planes into crowded buildings.

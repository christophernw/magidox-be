We are what Marx called "the reserve army of capitalism": we exist to keep the employed people from thinking that they have the right to the fruit of their labor.  If there were more jobs than workers, bosses would have to treat us better and pay us more, let us organize unions, get decent vacations, etc.  That's why the big businesses want lots of immigrants here, too: to keep wages down by making us fight for the scraps from their tables. (That's no reflection on the immigrants, who want to feed their families just like I do mine.)

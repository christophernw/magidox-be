what year of s-10? older without an airbag or newer with? if this truck is legally yours-and it is a factory installed original factory ignition in it, take the vin#, title, registration card or whatever as proof of ownership with you to a GM dealer and they may be able to make it on the spot with just that info! second choice, maybe calling a local locksmith as a last resort- since it would be the slower and pricier way.

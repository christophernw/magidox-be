The elf/gnome in this type of image symbolizes an Earth spirit and the mushroom that it sits upon is the way to contact it...Red mushroom with white dots?...Yup...Fly Agaric used for making 'Soma', the nectar of the Gods....A slightly narcotic and very hallucinogenic drink that allows one to contact spirits of all types.  But if you don't know the CORRECT way to make it, it can kill you, so be carefull!!!  The perfect mixture allows for out-of body experiences into what can only be called the "Realm of the Fey"...You'd just have to see it to understand why...

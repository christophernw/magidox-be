I presume you're talking about fluorescent bulbs which contain a small abount of a noble gas. A voltage is apliaed along the tube which strips some of the electrons from the gas atoms. When the electrons fall back onto the ionised atoms the energy is released as light of characteristic wavelength for the atom. The inside of the tube is coated with a fluorecent material which absorbs the light from the atoms and re-emits as white light.

The safety neutral switch is the part that keeps the vehicle from starting if the gear selector is in gear-on automatic transmission equipped vehicles. That way the car will not start unless the it is in Park or Neutral.  Manual transmission equipped vehicles have to have the clutch pushed in with this device.  All of this is not the problem however, because the vehicle would not even crank if that was the problem.  It could be the security (PASSKEY) in the ignition switch as you mentioned. Since the problem is intermittent I doubt the fuel system is at fault.  . . Good Luck.

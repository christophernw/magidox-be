Rush Limbaugh is making that claim, right now as we speak. Rush is also saying that Pelosi gave each one of these candidates $4,500.00 each. I don't know if he is right or not. I will say this, people are going to be who they are, no matter what is happening around them. So if these dems are really fiscally and socially conservative, then there could really be a fight for Pelosi and the far left fringe of the democratic party over the control of the democratic party. . . One thing is for absolutely sure. These democrats who were elected yesterday are most definately fiscally and socially conservative.. . The next two years should prove to be very interesting.. . In my humble opinion, the election yesterday shows tremendous support for conservatism and a rejection of republicanism.

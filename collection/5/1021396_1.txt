Lord Shiva (Hindu God) gav mankind marijuana for an "enjoyable pasttime." . . It is also noted that many anceitn cultures used it as a medicine. And we today are attempting to have medicinal uses legalized, however the Govt. does its best to prevent this due to the politics of money - too many drug companies stand to lose billions of dollars if everyone starts lighting up instead of taking pills. Thanks Pfizer!

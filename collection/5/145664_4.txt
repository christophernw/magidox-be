Bourbon is a type of Whiskey.. However, the use of the word "bourbon" is regulated by U.S. trade law. A whiskey can only be called bourbon if:. 1. It is at least 51% corn, or maize, with the remainder being wheat, rye, and malted barley.. 2. It is distilled to no more than 160 (U.S.) proof, and aged in new charred white oak barrels for at least two years. 3. It must be put into the barrels at no more than 125 U.S. proof. . So if Jack or Beam want to produce a whiskey just from rye, or age it less -- they can't call it bourbon by law. Method of filtration is irrelevant.

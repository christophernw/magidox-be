It is difficult to answer this question.  I feel one of the reasons behind this is that people this days are trying hard to accept the fact that Jesus christ is the way. Besides, thier intolerance sometimes arises from the fact bthat somewhere down deep in thier heart, they believe in the existence of Jesus but., there is a serious war going on within them wheter or not to believe in Him.. . It may also be that as Christians, we sometimes fail to see the need of people, we very easily condemn instead of spreading the love that Jesus preaches. Thus if people too readily see the love of in us without us pushing it in thier face that the need be perfect. Jesus will readily take us as we really are, making us into whom he wants us to be.. . However the intolerance unto the mention of the name of Jesus, predates us. It dates back to the time of his birth and this intolerance is perhaps the contributing factor to His death on the cross.. . People sometimes defend themselves in the face of the Truth: Jesus.

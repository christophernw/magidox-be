The difference in air pressure means it is impossible at high altitudes to open the emergency exit, and if they do somehow open it, the aircraft won't be that high, and unlike in movies where passengers get sucked out, the pressure is equalized when the door is opened, and also of course the oxygen masks will drop down.

nooo.... Clove oil, active ingredient eugenol, is being used increasingly in fish anesthesia, and is available from specialty food outlets and many pharmacies.. While flushing into the sewer system is almost invariably an effective means of killing a fish by exposure to intolerable water quality conditions, it is not necessarily rapid, and could pose the risk of introducing fish diseases to the local watershed.Hypothermia (chilling, freezing) is not considered to be humane when used as the sole method of euthanasia because the animal is not rendered rapidly insensible to pain or distress. However, freezing is an effective method of ensuring death of a fish and may be employed after the fish is insensible from an anesthetic overdose.

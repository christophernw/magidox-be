Its all about a belief. You believe that the instant a woman is pregnant that life exists. I believe that life doesnt exist until the fetus can feel pain which is at 16 1/2 weeks of pregnancy. The reason it is part of the womans movement is because women didnt have the right to vote. Now they have the right vote which is a choice and abortion, like many other things is all about The Right to Choose.

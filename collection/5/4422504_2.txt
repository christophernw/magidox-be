It's happened to me several times. I have applied for jobs, that I really wanted because of their location or because I was interested in their particular industry, and was told after the interview that they would love to hire me but my education and experience made me overqualified for the job and the pay scale. I have actually had to "dumb down" my resume to get a job. How stupid is that?

If you don't wanna take him to the vet. Then you'll have to wrap his leg up with a stick to hold it in a still position also to make it heal in the right position, then you get like an arm cast wrap it around the leg with the stick make sure it is nice and tight so it'll stay it that position k. I'm only thirteen going on fourteen but hey I'm a jr vet so it should work.

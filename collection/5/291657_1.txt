Islamic people believe in Allah, just as Christians believe in Christ and God.  There are many other religions, too.  It just seems as if the Islamic people are trying to take over the world because of all of the news reports on the radical Islamic terrorist cells.  People in the United States are free to worship whomever they will.  Unfortunately, many religions think their way is the only "right" way.  I study my Bible.  That is the right way for me!

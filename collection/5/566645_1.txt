Fox News reports without all the innuendo, sarcasm and slant the National News does.. Example; No matter what you think of Gitmo, if you are honest it has to infuriate you that two American servicemen, in the uniform of this country that should afford them protection in the event of capture, are tortured and slaughtered by animals.  Only Fox News has had the courage to report on the way this event has been reported on as compared to the hand-wringing that goes on constantly over Gitmo.

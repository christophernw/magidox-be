Atrial flutter and atrial Fibrillation are abnormal heart rhythms. The heart has 4 chambers the atria and the ventricles, this rhythm occurs in the atria thus atrial fib or flutter. the atria just set there and quiver and can lead to blood clots and stroke. This can sometimes be eradicated by medications or shocking the heart back into a normal rhythm. i hope this helps.

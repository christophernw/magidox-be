There is a hormone in your body called ADH (antidiuretic hormone) and this regulates how much water is stored in your body.  If you're not drinking enough water, your body will hold onto what it does get so, daft as it seems, drinking more water (this could include green or herbal teas) will get rid of water.  Additionally, if your diet is high in salt, this will also cause the body to retain water (the water follows the salt in the body so where the salt goes, so does the water - it's all to do with diffusion and concentrations of salts).

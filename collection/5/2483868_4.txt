I answered you last questions but maybe I left something out.  A lot of man cheat and even more have a wondering eye but the same is to be said about women.  But what I am saying is that your problem does not seem to be that you think your husband will ever cheat on you or leave you so My question is "Why are you letting this eat at you?" I am not saying that women should "NOT" worry about this I am saying that YOU should not worry about this unless you are keeping something out of the information that you gave us in the question.  But here if you man gets a chance to be with a famous modal that he lust after will he leave you after 20 years?  My guess from you info is no but to be honest the only person that can answer that is your husband and I don't think that you are giving him the chance to.. ALSO think about this is there a famous male model or movie star that you lust? And would you leave your husband for this other man if you got the chance?  TALK TO YOUR HUSBAND ABOUT THIS PLEASE.

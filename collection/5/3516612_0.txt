Striped toothpaste is produced by including two different colored toothpastes in an unusual type of packaging. The collapsible tube has two tanks, one filled with each color paste. Squeezing the tube pushes the two pastes out the opening. The tube nozzle layers the pastes to produce a striped pattern.

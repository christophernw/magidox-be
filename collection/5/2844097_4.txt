We are all destroying our planet, cause of materialism and bad attitude! Today I got really mad, in the grocery store there was a child screaming "I wanna I wanna I wanna". Where did she learn to be so needy of stuff. Every one wants a bigger car then the neighbour next door. Dealing with people that have road rage, why do they think they are the superior driver on the road and should have the right of way. How DID we become this way is the question?

Everyone dose have the freedom of choice. it is just that somtimes the choices are forced on us and we have to fight to get it right again. If a five year old is assulted it is not there choice to be asslutd it is the choice of the person doing the assult. It is then the duty of the parents to hunt down and destroy the person who assluted the child.

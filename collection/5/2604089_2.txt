Good question.  I've never heard of this before.  My suggestion, for what it's worth, is to take the fish out as stated in another answer.  Obvioudly you have to find the reason why the ants liked your fish tank.  What kind of tank is it, fresh or salt? What kind of fish food did you use, because it might of drawn the ants in the first place?  What did the ants look like?  Do you have ant problems elsewhere, or just with the tank?

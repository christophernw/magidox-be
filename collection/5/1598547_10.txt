we are never coming home that why they are building 12 big bases there. They are building the biggest American embassy in the world in Iraq. The point of going into Iraq was not to get out it was to stay in. There is a lot of money to be made in all the chaos and destruction. You cant think about  this in right or wrong fashion. This is about money, everything is about money, money is everything. Nothing happens in this world without money and a deal. Just keep that into prospective. They do not care about the same things you do none of them Dems or Rep. I will say that the Dems are the lesser of the two evils but in the global economy it is cash that makes the world go round. If you don't understand that you will never understand why we went into the middle east.

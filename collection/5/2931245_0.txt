I think exploiting is deliberately  using dishonest tactics in order to deceive or cheat in any way. Advertising, on the other hand, is an attempt to sell or let others know of a product or service (good or bad) that is available, thus giving the buyer or user the choice of making up their own minds without undo pressure.

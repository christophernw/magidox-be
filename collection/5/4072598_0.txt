I'm assuming you don't have something at home like quikstop for when you accidental hit the vein when clipping nail, but how about the man of the house (if there is one).  Many time, men have a styptic pencil or the like and that can help.  Otherwise, try some cornstarch or flour and pat some on the toe nail to help it clot and stop bleeding.  . Good luck.

Pitts can and are a very dangerous breed. It takes a very alert owner to control their dog.  You may very well be a responsible owner, but I have found alot of young people who buy pitts make them mean by engaging in dog fights which is also very dangerous and unfair to the poor dog but also illegal. Many times these dogs are owned by drug dealers.  Take great care when choosing new owners when you go to sell them.  And just in case you are not responsible,  watch your back as the long arm of the law is probably watching YOU.

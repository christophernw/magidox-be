Med school just means medical school. If you want to be a doctor, you spend four years after college in medical school, and then another 3-10 years after medical school as a resident physician or fellow.. . When people put med school as their source it just means that the answer is common knowledge to physicians. (although that hardly makes it common knowledge)

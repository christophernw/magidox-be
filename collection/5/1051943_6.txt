i guess you haven't been listening to the news or you'd stop trying to bash democrats and start trying to CYA again like republicans always do... the lady in Florida who is in charge of all the voting and was for the past couple of elections? yeah.. she said that all the 9/11 widows are enjoying their husbands deaths.... ouch.. oh yeah.. and as of right now they are seeking her for felony charges...  it hasn't gone to the prosecutor yet but it will very soon if she doesn't respond... she voted in the wrong district and hasn't responded to requests for her correct address..... and she'll be in jail if she doesn't... that's right.. run away now and get a life.

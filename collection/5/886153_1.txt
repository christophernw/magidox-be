I think anytime we believe in something that brings us joy we want others to share that same joy, and religion is like that for people. When they find something that makes them feel good and changes their lives they think that others should believe it too. But we have human rights to decide what we want to believe and in who. But I think its just the joy people feel when they find something they want to share it with other, which means trying to convert them. It not that bad, if you do not want to be converted you just say no. A real Christian  ( or maybe any other religions) should know that you should not judge another for their choices in life. I can say that what I believe and that its the best but if you say no, my job is done.

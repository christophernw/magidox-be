A counselor should be an advisor, and a self development tool.. Usually they have many people they advise by appointment only.. . A youth worker should help youth develop their own skills and self esteem, helping them reach their potential, usually in a daily group setting, such as after school programs. . Amazingly many young people who have had the opportunity to work with good youth workers go on to become counselors and community leaders.

I am sorry if I sounded mean or something.  I wasn't trying to be.  I have actually been down this road twice.  I am also a very religous person.  And one of my friend was only 16 and died on Christmas.   I am truly sorry for your loss.  . . I don't think God took her.  She took a chance when she tried heroin.  Think about whether or not she knew that herion was a serious drug to take.  Many people die a year of heroin on their first time use.   Her body simply could not handle it.  . It sounds like he gave her the dose he as a seasoned user would have taken.  Please do not get angry at the well meaning advice given by  people.  Just take what you know of the Bible.  Does it ever say that God will "take" someone to teach others a lesson.. . Blaming God for your friend using heroin.  Is the same for me to blame God for my dads heart attack.  We have choices. My dad ate "meat and potatos" breads, and sweets his whole life.  Never wanted or tried to change his eating habbits.. My dad had a heart attack because he did not take care of himself.  He was actually young.   . Your friend died because she took a chance on heroin.   . Be angry at God if you need to be.  God understands your anger.   Anger is the natural part of the grieving process.  We need someone to blame over a senseless death of a young person.   When all rationality says they should still be alive.  . . Did they young man that do the injection get into trouble.  He could be convicted of manslaughter.   Maybe you should focus your attention on talking to the police and getting that young man into trouble.  Blame him for injecting her, introducing her to the drug, convencing her to let him do it, and not having enough sense that a first time user did not need that much.

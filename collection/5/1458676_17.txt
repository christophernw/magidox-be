Subconsciously, all criminals want to be caught-- only on there own terms-- as if to say, "Look what I accomplished," and to then have the easy out of "I would have gotten away with it had I not returned to the scene of the crime.". . Male criminals typically do this.  I don't think a female criminal would ever be so vain or idiotic.

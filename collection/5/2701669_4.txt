The gnome elf usually sits on a specific, particular mushroom...which is red, with white dots... it's a poisonous mushroom actually, the Amanita Muscaria. This mushroom, when eaten, causes visions and hallucinations (It was known in old times too, by the vikings, for example, they used to eat small quantities of this mushoroom in order to reach the higher level of fury and violence in battle, the Berserk)...elfs are creatures of the unknown, of the  dream...and they sit on a toxic mushroom because they come from that specific part of our culture, from the dark side of human consciousness

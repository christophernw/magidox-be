i don't blame the system, i blame the big corporations that break the law.  we have plenty of workers here that need to support their families on higher pay because of the higher cost of living here.  the corporations hire illegals because they are greedy.  illegals will work cheaper because they can't complain or they'll get sent back home. i cannot morally withhold health care, food, a decent living place to illegals, so that presents a "catch 22". our law enforcement should enforce the law. our judges should back our laws.

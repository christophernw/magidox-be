Until about 1000, there were only Christians (though there were quite a few different sects until about 400).  Then the Christians split into the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches.  They split over two major issues, the idea of the pope and the use of icons.. . Around 1600 the Roman Catholic church was split again, this time by people who "Protested" what they Church as doing.  Therefore, all non-Roman Catholic demoninations are generally referred to as "Protestants".  When today someone says they are a "Christian", they are generally meaning a protestant.  Catholics and Orthodox call themselves by those names.. . Led largely by Martin Luther and Calvin, and getting a big boost in popularity from Henry VIII, non-Catholic Churches got a big boost.. . Today, "Christian" is even more narrow.  It tends to exclude Anglicans (which is very close to Catholism) as people use it.  Although Anglicans and Catholics ARE Christians, the term as used today by all rest is used specifically to denote that they are NOT a Catholic-type religion.  That is why I am writing "Christians" with the quotes.. . Here are the major differences between "Christians" and "Catholic-type" religions:. . 1.  Tradition - Catholic-type religions accept the tradition of the Church as important, "Christians" don't.. 2.  Praying to Mary or the Saints - "Christians" don't. 3.  Sola Scriptura - "Christians" believe all you need is the bible, no teachings of men or the Church. 4.  The clergy - much more important in the Catholic-type religions. 5.  Faith Vs Works -  "Christians" place much less emphasis on what you do, but instead on what you beleive.  Catholic-types believe both are equally important.. . That's about it, but I would say #5 above is the biggest split today.

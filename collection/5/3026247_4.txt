The Ginger Gene hypothesis states that red hair and fair skin evolved over 100 thousand years ago (based on genetic evidence) but modern humans had not moved out of Africa by that time.  This would mean that the trait would have either be carried over by the people migrating out of Africa (in which case all races would have some people with red hair), or it means that there were a different group living outside of Africa who contributed to the genetic makeup of northern Europeans.  This hypothesis states that it is possible Neandertals developed in this region, and then intermixed with the populations coming out of Africa.

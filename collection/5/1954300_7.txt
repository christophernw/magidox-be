I personally think that most Americans isolate themselves from the rest of the world so when they are asked whether or not they are interested in learning another language.. I  have often heard answers like "for what?" or "we are in America.. only English" .  Being able to communicate with one another should not be seen as an attack to American Culture. Our main language is English and I agree it should remain that way, but there are so many advantages to learning different languages.  If you travel abroad, you will find that many speak 2, 3 or more languages and they do not feel their patriotism threatened.

I'll answer with an example. Calculate the squareroot of 11.. . - First look for an approximation. Let's take 3, as 3*3=9.. - Divide 11 by 3. This gives 3.667. Take the average of this number and your approximation 3. Result: 3.333.. This is the second approximation.. - Continue like this. 11/3.333=3.3 Average (3.3+3.333)/2 = 3.3166 Third approximation. . . Etc The real squareroot of 11 is 3.3166248, so we are approaching quickly.

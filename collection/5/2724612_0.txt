Cytoplasm is the area within the cell inside the plasma membrane (the membrane separate the cell to others) and outside the nucleus (the region contaning genetic materials DNA). Cytoplasm contains many internal organelles (internal structures) that are necessary for cell's functions.. INternal organelles: Ribosome (needed to make proteins), Golgi complex, lysosomes (digest defective materials in cells, only found in animal cells),Endoplastic Reticulum (2 types: rough with ribosome attached and smooth without ribosome), central vacuole (store H2O, toxins, pigments, waste), Mitochondria (use to make energy for cell, mostly from glucose), chloroplast (needed for photosynthesis in plant cells only),cytoskeleton (connect organelles to each other and membrane, control cell movement, cilia and flagella (cell movements inside an organism).

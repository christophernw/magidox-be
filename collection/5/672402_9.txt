Intelligent design is the idea that Someone or Something had a hand in the creation of the universe.  While most scientists still try to hold on to the Big Bang or "Random Occurence" theory, this idea has been gaining more and more merit based on the idea that something had to start the universe.. . It is the idea that somehow, at the beginning of existence, someone or something had a hand in creating the known universe.  Some claim this as a God-like being which is what most religions base their beliefs on that a single, all-powerful being created the universe... or as some more new-age or revolutionary beliefs have theorized, that God (or some such being) created the universe and then let it go from there.. . I could type several pages on this but I believe that a quick search on google or yahoo search engines for Intelligent design will benefit you best.  Just be sure to get both sides of it as I am sure there are alot of sites that bash this theory too.. . . As for icarus's response, I would disagree with his point of view.  Be sure to search out answers for youself and don't allow people like him/her (or myself for that matter) to dictate for you.  But as a minor note... intelligent design is not simply a religious belief cloaked in scientific terminology.  I could say the same for "scientific" theories about it.  But will not deign to stoop to that level. :D

The fear response is as old as man and is a survival mechanism from the days when there were a lot of wild ferocious beasts around and we didn't have very good weapons.  Anxiety, which may be what you're aiming at,  stems from our aloneness as humans.  In infancy we need constant care and being left alone (which we all are at some time) can trigger the fear response.  . . On the other hand it could just be God playing tricks!

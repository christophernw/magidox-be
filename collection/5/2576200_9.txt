Some farts smell "bad" because of what ingredients go into the gas. . . In general, meat and other animal products will have more sulfur (which is what most people think of when they think of fart smell) which get broken down into sulfides and passed out as stinky farts. . . Beans and lettuce, while creating their fair share of the flatulence, aren't sulfide rich and this don't create the same bad smell. . . Hope this helps feed your need for knowledge of fabulous flatulence.

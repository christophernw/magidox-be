Sun shines on the earth's surface and some spots heat up faster than others.  cities with a lot of concrete and little vegetation heat up faster than forests. The heated surface heats the air above it. As the air heats, it expands, becomes lighter and rises.  When that air leaves the surface some air has to come from somewhere to replace it--otherwise we would have a place with no air and couldn't breathe.  Nature doesn't like a vaccuum.  (Heard that before?)  so. . . surrounding air moves in to take the place of the rising air.  Moving air...we have a name for that--wind.

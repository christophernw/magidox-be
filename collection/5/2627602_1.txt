I assume you mean in plants.. . The chloroplasts work most efficiently with other wavelengths of light. That's it really. It just kinda happens that way.. . (not all chloroplasts can absorb every wavelength of light, some work on lower frequency and some work on higher frequency, green just seems to be in the middle of the two and gets left out for the most part.)

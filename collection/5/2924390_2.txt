Some of them are like little lemmings who do it cause that's what their parents did.. . One time I asked all the Catholic people with ashes on their fore heads at my work what it standed for.  No one could tell me, some even called their parents to ask why they did it.  Eventually I had to look it up on the internet to find out.

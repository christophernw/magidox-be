I don't know about everyone, but when it comes to Christians asking that question I can only guess that either they don't read or they don't fully understand what the Bible says.. . 2 Corinthians 4:3  And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing.  (4)  In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.  (5)  For what we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.  (6)  For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

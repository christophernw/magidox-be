I believe you have to complete a two year degree in MLT at a NAACLS accredited college before you can sit for the exam.  At least for the ASCP (see above).  The AMT (American Medical Technologist) may allow you to complete an internship at a hospital and then sit for the exam.  They are less picky than the ASCP - but also less respected.. . My advice to you is to get your biology degree (Associates?) and then find a good University that offers a BA in Medical Technology (MT).  MTs are in much more demand than MLTs - and they get paid more.  You'll already have the majority of your prerequisites out of the way and it'll make the going a lot easier for you.. . But I'm pretty sure that a Biology degree alone will not qualify you to sit for an MLT certification exam.  The reason for this is that MLT courses are far more indepth than any biology class.  It'll definitely be tough to pass the certification exam without the classes.. . Check out:. . ascp.org. naacls.org. . Good luck!

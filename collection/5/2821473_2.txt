You don't take care of them, you let them go free and allow Mother Nature to take care of them. They will die very shortly in most artificial environments (i.e., jars, aquariums).. . There is no concern regarding the population of lightning bugs, and therefore, one shouldn't concern oneself with the idea of "breeding" them. Mother Nature creates plenty of them. . . Just let them go free and enjoy them on a nice summer night. Let them enjoy themselves and bring delight to others. It is cruel to keep such creatures locked away from their natural environment. Would you like to be locked away from your house, food, and possessions?

Adelaide is mid-winter in July so it's pretty cold, a bit rainy (general winter conditions), it's not as cold as the more mountainous areas of australia though.. Darwin only has two seasons- wet and dry -this is because the temperature only really varies between about 14-34 degrees celcius here, but in the wet season (oct-may) we get monsoon rains and the humidity soars to over 90%, which many people find unbearable.  In contast the dry season typically has little rain, much lower humidity and the temps are at the lower end of the scale which most people find comfortable in shirts/shorts - some of us locals might break out a jacket on a cool evening though.

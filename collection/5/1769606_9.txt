Some of your answers are straight from the mouths of clowns I would put something a little stronger, but the site **** it. If the young man joined the military, maybe he felt he had something to prove to himself.  Maybe to get away from mom and dad, to do something on his own.  How many that answered "stupid move" or "have you killed any kids yet" still live at home, have mom and dad pay for your car and wipe your ass for you.  For whatever reason he entered the military, power to him.  He did something with his life he felt he needed to do.  Instead of being a pimple on societies butt like some of you are I am positive.

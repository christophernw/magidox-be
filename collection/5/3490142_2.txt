It was built, as was the rest of the Iron Curtain, to contain the citizens of East Berlin, and to limit contact between East and West.. . Generally, the Communist regime in Soviet Russia and its satellites (Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, etc.) were economically and otherwise so depressed and depressing that people would have left if they had half a chance.   (Many left, via escape, anyway...)   So the wall was necessary to prevent a mass exodus, and to limit the inflow of information about the "greener pastures" outside.

You can give bankruptcy a try. It wipes all your debts. There are strong conditions that go with this though, and it depends on which country and state you are in. Like a period of say 7 years of no loans, or credit, not leaving the country and a few other minor restrictions. When the time span is over your debt is cleared and you can start over again.  But you must hand back any material item that you are in debt with. I think that's a small price to pay for financial freedom, if it's really getting you down. Life is too short to be way over your head financially. I am broke all ways have been.  But I am never in debt.

Because religion is all about social control and money. Did you ever hear of a religion that didn't want to control people or that never asked for money.. Naturally a lot of people think that they should have equal opportunities in this field so they just go on inventing  new types of christianity and claiming it to be the only right one.. This leads to conflict with other religions which see their market share disappearing.

I am still trying to figure out exactly where in the bible sex is specifically stated as sin.  I have heard it reffered to as the original sin, but that was defying GOD when they ate from the forbidden tree.. . The bible simply states that we shouldn't have multiple sex partners, reason being as we now know....STD's, confusion in families due to multiple father's.  All I have ever read was that the two become one.  No mention of sin.

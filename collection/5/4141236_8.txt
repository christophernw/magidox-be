you can really call it an invasion it wasnt that is just what the antibush people call it you dont hear it called that in the news,.  really only when the demacrates a talking. the reason we are in Iraq  is to  get a little farther at ridding the world of terrism and freeing  iraq from a dictatership if anyone I mean anyone does not thing this is good meaning they love terrorism and dictatorships should go release him from prison and make him President of the USA and see how much you like  living without freedom. everyone want freedom  to choose.  the real question is  why does pwople want Irag to be free.

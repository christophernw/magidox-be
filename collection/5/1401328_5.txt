American football is a modified form of the English game rugby. Versions of football have been played in the United States since the 1850’s, but it was not until 1873 that the Intercollegiate Football Association was formed to consolidate many disparate rules of play. By 1882, rules were further revised to a format that closely resembles those used in today’s game. Today, football has more rules than any other team sport. The first professional football game was played in 1892.

It depends on the school or jurisdiction.  In Ohio, and at the University of Akron, they typically will not allow you to apply until you are 18.  The Ohio Bar does not allow you to apply to sit for the exam until you are 21.  HOWEVER, schools and bars will always make exceptions.  . . And if you're a little more seasoned (over 50), I go to law school with quite a few people who are nearing their 60's.  The law schools like to see life experience.  It makes for an interesting entering class.  . . Please, don't hesitate...apply and go for it!

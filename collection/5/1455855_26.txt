I would say somewhere in between what is LEGAL for where you live and death.. . Sorry for sounding HARSH... what I mean is that if the age difference isn't illegal, then anything else would be permissible.  Although, the GREATER the difference in age would often mean a greater difference of what would interest BOTH individuals.  . . Also, if there is a great age discrepancy, what is the motivating factor of hooking up in the first place?. . As for comparing what is LEGAL from what is PRUDENT is matter of personal choice versus any obstacle.

air itself acts like a prism. the sky normally loosks blue in the day because blue light scatters around more (is reflected or re-emitted more) while other light flies straighter through the air. . . When sun is setting, different reflection and refraction happen because the light is going through more air, and at a different angle. It bends and bounces different, just like looking at something from the side of a magnifying glass instead of from straight on.. .  It also goes through a lot more of the LOWER atmosphere which contains pollution, dust, smoke, and water vapor.

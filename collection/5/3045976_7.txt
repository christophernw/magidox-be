Peace cannot reign in the world everywere, only in small instances that we work hard to make. The little bits of peace that we help build energize us to in turn create more.. One of the largest problems in the world is the "information age". It has complicated society and created a growth that is not only unprecendented it is uncontainable and will only have an eventual negative impact. The solution? pull the plug (I will if everyone else does) after the resulting Chaos is settled many of us will be able to develop small communities and find the peace that we all want.

I think that he is bored.  You most likely need to take him for a long hard walk at least 30 minutes a day.  If you cant do 30 a day then 15 minutes to start with.  But my German has to have hard play or exercise twice daily, being I live in Texas I take him on a 30 to 40 minute walk in the morning, and then let him chase the pool sweeper around the pool till he is so tired that he only sleeps after that .

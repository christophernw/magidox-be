As as Catholic I find your question interesting to say the least.. . How did you come to the conclusion it is a false religion...and I ask this out of wanting to know what your "proof" is?. . For the other posters:. . Mary is not worshiped she is honered as the Mother of Jesus.. . We do not worship statues we worship God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit...the statues in church are to remind us of saints and to live a saintly life as much as possible.

When a force is exerted on a moving object, obviously by another moving object, the force transfers a lot of its energy into the other object. Think of it like the game of pool.. . When the cue (white) ball hits another ball, it pretty much stops on contact and the ball it hits moves away. The energy was transfered into the opposite ball.

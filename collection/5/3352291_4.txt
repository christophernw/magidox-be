It is a compound word meaning a philosophy that is Theistic in nature. Philosophy means, "lover of knowledge" in Greek, and Theos means God in the same language. So literally, it would be "lover of knowledge of God". So it's someone whose thought processes revolved around understanding knowledge from God's point of view. In the book of Proverbs, chapter 1, this is a definition of wisdom :)

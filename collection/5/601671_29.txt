I have no problem working... Nor working in the hot sun. but I will not work for minimum wage anymore, nor will I work without benefits.. I tried playing by the rules, and local 95 UAW, Janesville Wisconsin lets the company get away with anything the management wishes!. It costs more in gas to get to a job now, than minimum wage. pays!. I have heard the same argument saying that somebody wont. work for less than 12.00, I think this is B/S, but their. prerogative.

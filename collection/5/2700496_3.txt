LOL, it's not new!  Boomers felt -and some still feel -the same towards the "Geezers", the generation that preceeded the Boomers.  And the Geezers felt the same way towards those who preceeded them, and on back through history...even the great philosophers of antiquity pondered the generational differences.  We're talking guys who lived, thought and wrote thousands of years ago, yo!. . It's primarily biological.  Human animals are programmed to be ferociously competitive simply to survive, as we once had to do right after we climbed down outa the trees and began walking upright.  Oaky, yeah, we had to be tough before then, too...the "out of the trees" is just an imperfect analogy.  Anyway, it's built in.  Younger hunters/warriors had to push the older guys out of the way whenever the older guys began to slow down in their reaction times and running ability because the slower they were, the hungrier the tribe would be.  Ever try to run down an antelope?  Then you get my drift, don't ya?  Also, the older guy is less likely a good candidate for a mate - girls needed to save themselves for really healthy mates who were more likely to produce healthy offspring.  That's why most young women prefer young men rather than the more experienced and often gentler older man when it comes to reproductive behaviors.  It's just plain nature, y'see.

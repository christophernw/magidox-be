I'm ready to go now because I'm a sinner saved by the grace of God through the blood of Jesus Christ. That makes me a winner. I'll never suffer, hunger, worry, or die or have any loved ones die. No one can imagine the joy we'll have when it finally comes. I can hardly wait. I have a heart disease and can go at any time now. Even so come Lord Jesus.

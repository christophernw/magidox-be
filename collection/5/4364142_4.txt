Go to someone who's in the scientific community and works on the same field. Discuss your theory with her or him.. . Don't be too disappointed if you find out that there are some problems with your theory, science has come a long way in the last thousands of years, so the most "easy to find" things are already found, and most professional scientists do not make any great discoveries in their career.. . But maybe you really found a great theory, seldom but sometimes self-taught people make great scientific work. The famous mathematician George Green for example was a miller and had just one year formal school and had a similar problem to publish his theory. (see link)

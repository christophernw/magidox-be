This is a really bad idea.. . If you really want to, the best bet is to replace the entire drivetrain.  Engine, transmisison, all of it.  You'll have to fabricate a new driveshaft of the correct length, and figure out a way to wedge that giant hunk of metal into the RX-7's engine bay.. . If you want more power, buy a new car.  Or make some minor engine mapping changes to the one you have.  As a rule, the more you modify your car, the more awful it will be.

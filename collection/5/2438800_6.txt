Im not really sure abou t this one, but I know that when particles are heated they break apart and when they are cooled they come together. like when you boil water steem comes up because the particles become light.. . So when you put hot water in the freezer, my theory is: the particles are already loose and can therefore come back together very quickly. and in waters normal form the particals arent as loose.. . I have read the link given by the first answer and i think my theory is wrong:)

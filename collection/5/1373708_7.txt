Interesting research. Could it be that people who hold more "traditional" American values are happier than others. The survey points out as well, that the married are happier that unmarried and worshipers are happier than non- worshiper.. . I think that there is a certain mindset of a Republican. Democrats are seen as whiny while Republicans are seen as selfish and evil. Whether or not there is any truth to that, who knows, but I do think that Republicans may be more self-reliant and self-sufficient than Democrats. Democrats see all the problems while Republicans see all the opportunity. I'm not suggesting that either is all bad or all good. I just think that the mindset may be different for each group which would affect happiness.

I think you know you handled it poorly but that's a good sign. It means you really ARE maturing.. . Usually anger stems from feeling like we have lost control. Really examine what was said and WHEN you got angry.. . Then think of other ways you could have stopped the event before you blew your stack. That's the way you should handle it next time. . . It's a life lesson for you so stop dwelling- you can let yourself off the hook if you've created a better coping strategy.

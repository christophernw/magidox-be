No evolutionst can explain this question. Basically, an eye would be completely useless unless it was totally formed. But it would not have evolved unless there was an eye to improve on. There is no logical way an organism could evolve to have something that senses light, especially colors, the way an eye does. And the eye is not the only thing like this. Feathers, legs, and many others either would be useless or need to be fully formed.

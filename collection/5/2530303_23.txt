Sometimes it is hard to understand why someone wouldn't want a child... but it really isn't our place to judge them or their situation.  Financially or emotionally it maybe too great of a burden on the Mom or it maybe what is truly best for everyone if the pregnancy is terminated.   If a parent will only neglect or abuse the child I think it is the most responsible thing to do in some cases.. rather than put the child in a system that is already over flowing with unwanted or abused children.  Of course if the mom was raped or molested a pregnancy would be a horrible reminder of that violation.   It would be a wonderful world if every child was conceived out of love and every child was meant to be but this is not a perfect world so termination is a necessary evil.

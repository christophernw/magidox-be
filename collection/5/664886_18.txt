I dont always go after Christianity,just most of the time. This is just because MOST Christians get annoying after they keep trying to convert you into Christianity.I usually just ask them to stop politely, some of them stop,but most of them just keep on going. Thats the part that gets me annoyed about Christianity, when Christians just cant leave me alone. Then again , it is just MOST of the Christians, not all.I only respect Christians if they respect me. It is really not Christianity that i go after , it is the ignorant,and disrespectful  "Christians" that dont listen or disrespect other peoples spirituality.Another minor reason that i go after Christianity is because it it the religion that affects society the most.It is as if religion is mixing with politics. It is unconstitutional when a right of a person is not allowed all because of another persons sprituality and beliefs.

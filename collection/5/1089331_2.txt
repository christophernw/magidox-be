The question should be, 'Why is the second oldest profession in the world illegal in many countries?' The answer would be conventional societal norms undermining the reality of the world. Even in the most repressive or theocratic regimes, prostitution is ever present, in both genders. In retrospect, it is only natural in society to have such commercial interests at hand, as self-gratification is often the primary reason for consumerism. To make it illegal because of religious or social considerations is a farce. Personally, it is an honest living made by many honest people, who just wants to lead honest lives. Due to societal hypocrisy, prostitution is often more reviled than other more unsavory criminal activities, such as drugs and arms smuggling. Making it illegal also forces participants in that economy to fall prey to criminality, as the demand is present, which the underworld is all too ready to supply.

You can't (nor should you want to) get a job back from which you were fired for reasons other than a general layoff.. . If it was a general layoff, you may be able to simply apply for the job again when the company is recruiting.. . If you were wrongfully terminated, seek the advice of a civil defense attorney (i.e. personal injury, etc...).

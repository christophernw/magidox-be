Twist and pull off the wires on the top of the valve cover. The wires must go back on the same plug, but they are marked 1-2-3,and 4 on the coil (thats where the other end of the wires go). It will be hard to get them out of order, but still you may only want to do one cylinder at a time. The cylinders are numbered 1-2-3, and 4 from the front of the ngine to the rear (left to right if you are in front of the car). . Once you have removed the wire/s from the plug, use a 5/8" spark plug socket and an extension  and ratchet to remove the plugs. Check the gap om the new plugs and screw them back in. Tigthen til they just seat, the turn an additional 1/4 turn only. TIP, to help get them started, use a piece of rubber hose on the end of the plug as a tool to start it into it's hole, then finish as described above. . . If you have 50,000 or more miles on your car, it's probably a good idea to change the wires also. They are fairly cheap.. . Good Luck

Input and output variables are for when you are working with equations.  For example, you have an equation "y = x + 2".  This has two variables, x and y.  One is an input variable and the other is an output variable.  If you set a value of "1" to x, x becomes an input variable.  When you solve the equation, y = x + 2; y = 1 + 2; y = 3.  Y is your output variable because it gives you your result.  Think of it like a pop machine...you "input" a few quarters, and it "outputs" a soda.  It is the same for equations.  When you set a value to one variable, you are able to solve for the other.. . Other examples:. . y = x^2. x is input; y is output. input value of "3" to x, the output is 9 (3^2)

This doesn't mean that he was abused with the broom/mop/vacum! I've had several dogs from breeders who treated their dogs wonderfully and they still didn't like these items. They may just not understnd what these itmes are or they have never seen them before. Think about it, if you were a dog that size and you saw a broom coming towards you wouldn't you be a little bit threatened?

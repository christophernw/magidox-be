The same reason the United Nations spends 1/3 of its time and money bashing Israel ... while people in Africa suffer slavery and starvation.. . Can't let nice sounding names fool you, like "Human Rights Watch" or "Amnesty International".  These are anti-American, anti-civilization, anti-Semitic organizations with an agenda that has nothing to do with real human rights.

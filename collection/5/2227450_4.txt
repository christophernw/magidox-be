WTF?. . You need help mate!. . You can't be a Hindu and still believe in Jesus. The Bible is the word of God and Jesus and it says in the Bible there is only one God, in the Hindu religion there are many.. . Also since you asking this question it's obvious you shouldn't be changing.. . As for going to hell for changing your religion, that's a made up rule by people trying to keep you in thier religion.. . What is Xtian? If you mean Christian then you are sadly mistaken, you arn't. Xtian? Get help man, get it now.

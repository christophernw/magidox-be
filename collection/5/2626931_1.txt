You can't, it is against privacy laws.  He can file a police report, and they can track it down, but you have no interest, and are not entitled to the information anyway.  The last person I know that got hold of that information (illegally) got a couple of buddies and went over and put a guy in hospital.  Not only did all 3 of them end up in jail for assault, but they got the wrong guy because the plate  traced had one number wrong.  Leave it to the police.

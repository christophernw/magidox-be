When a gigantic comet flew by Mars, their plasma sheaths touched each other and a massive lightning bolt struck the planet.  It really must have torn the place up, because it created the Valles Marineris and caused all sorts of massive eruptions, creating the Olympus Mons.  Several million cubic kilometers of rock and debris were ejected into the atmosphere, which is why you see all the rocks scattered across the surface of Mars.  Some of these rocks and debris were able to escape the planet's gravity, and so we're still getting pelted with it to this day.  Just do a search for "Mars plasma discharge" and you'll pull up some more info and evidence for this theory.

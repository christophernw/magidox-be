It's the same everywhere. There is a standoff brewing between America and Iran over the development of nuclear weapons there and since a large amount of the world's oil supply comes from Iran there are fears of a drop in supply. This is driving up prices although some places are taking advantage and putting up massive prices hikes. There are bound to be some service stations selling as cheap as possible to attract customers. Shop around in your area and dont support the rip off merchants.

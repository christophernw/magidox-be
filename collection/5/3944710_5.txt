You don't need to eat the flesh of living beings to be healthy. But meat gives us a complete protein, without it you need to be very careful to balance your food intake to make sure you get complete protein (that is, all of the essential amino acids that we need. Different animals have different amino acid requirements depending on their genes. Our genes make some proteins, but not all proteins.) It would be better for the environment if we all cut back, though, nobody needs to eat it three times a day. Look at www.myfootprint.org

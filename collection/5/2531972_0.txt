because philippine population are getting bigger and why only this time that phil.gov't proposed this 2 child policy?. They should had it implemented as early as previous gov't.. Ooh men... they (gov't)are crazy!!!!. I have 2 children and I agree with the 2 child policy.. Hunger is being experience by many Filipinos this time.... also lots are jobless, insurgency, terrorism...

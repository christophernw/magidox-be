Hello,. . Micro finance is a relatively new term. It is used to explain a system of loans & savings, usually in countries where there is such a high level of poverty, where people are so poor they cannot get conventional bank accounts, loans or credit.. . For Example: In rural india the farmers couldnt afford the buy enough seeds & chemical furtilisers for the next seasons crops. So the farmers in the village all clubbed together & formed a savings union were each person although poor gave a tiny amount of cash each month into the scheme. From this micro loans enabled them to buy the seeds & furtilisers they needed. Without the micro financing this just wouldnt have been possible for each farmer involved.. . **Another aspect of micro finance is when a person or people are so poor they dont have any security or assetts against which to borrow money, any money at all.. . So Micro finance is where small amounts of money are collected and small loans or finance is enabled as a result. Without such schemes the people would be quite literally pennyless and might not even have enough to eat or survive (yes! hard to believe but true?!!).. . **Strength in numbers, the benefit of clubbing together even if you are poor. Something is better than nothing? when you have no other options left.. . IR

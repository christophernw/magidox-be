Catholics are Christians, as you well know. I am a protestant christian, but I respect the catholics. That was very well said. Mary is a Saint above all Saints, and even though I'm a protestant, I always remember Mary in my prayers. I thank her for saying yes to God, and giving birth to the Savior of the world. I really liked the way you expressed John the Baptist, doing a cartwheel in Elizabeth's womb. Stay strong in your faith and God Bless.

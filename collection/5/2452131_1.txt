Its illegal, but can be done. I was told during uni by a lecturer that if a large enough capacitor was placed in between the live and netrual terminals of a plug, then the meter would run slowly. *NOTE i am not endorsing breaking the law, neither am i certain it would ever work and besides, ive no idea of the values involved. You'd need a big brain, some electrical knowlege and a calculator for certain!

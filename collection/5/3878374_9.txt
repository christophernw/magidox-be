The Constitution has it limited to two terms. I think all elected Federal officials should have only one term in office, then unless they run for President, they cannot hold another elected office.. . that would cut down on the life long politicians like Tedd Kennedy, and cut down on the number of them on the take from big business and from Unions.. . Limit them across the board and America would get back to where we should be.

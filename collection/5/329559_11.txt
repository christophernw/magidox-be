Ahha, a million dollar question!  This has been the case for years.  Situations at home and in society are usually a good aim for a cause.  As many have said before me in many situations, school just isn't a high priority compared to helping on the farm, or getting a job to help pay for that car or help mom and dad get bills in the mail.

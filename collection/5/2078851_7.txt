To improve the sleep you get you can do a couple of things.  First, stop all activities other than sleeping in bed or room.  If you read, watch TV or study in bed (or sometimes even in the same room) you body and mind become acustomed to being stimulated in that location and it become more difficult to sleep there.  . . Second, avoid the use insense, air fresheners or rooms sprays with non-relaxing scents. Particularly spices, strong florals and minty smells.  Replace those with relaxing scents like lavender, very light rose or sandlewood. Lavender is the best for this purpose, in my opinion.. . Third, try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.  By doing this your body will become acustomed to settling at a particular time and make it easier to fall asleep.

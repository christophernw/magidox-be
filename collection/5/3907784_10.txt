Give me a freaking break. Yea Bush is a idiot, I didn't vote for him. Yet Saddam gets booted out and what happens??? Do the Iraqi people rejoice and rebuild their country????NNNOOOO....Old tribal and religious feuds from God knows how long ago flame out of control.That's our fault????? What our fault was expecting the Iraqi people to know how to deal with democracy(other than creative power drill torture and video beheadings). I guess it's a culture thing Dado cause I just don't get this love for death and destruction. It won't stop after we leave because it isn't us behind all bombings and abductions and YOU know it.

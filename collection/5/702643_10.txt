Yes. Terrorism is not something that can be reasoned with. The people who want to hurt our nation will stop at NOTHING to kill Americans and hurt America. So, we have two choices. We can sit around and continue to take it up the poop chute, or we can be proactive and kill as many of them as we can. So far, I like what we are doing. Thanks to the sacrifice hundreds of thousands of American soldiers, sailor, airmen and Marines - not to mention the ULTIMATE sacrifice that 2200 - have made to our country, my mom and dad - and YOUR mom and dad - don't have to worry about the first option.. . I have been in the military for 15 years and have done two tours in Iraq. I am packed and ready to go again tomorrow if the call comes.. . mpsgt04 - Zell Miller couldn't have said it better himself!!  ;-)

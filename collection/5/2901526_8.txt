I wouldn't advise doing it.  However, I did it when I was 15...only had the braces on for 3 mos.  My mother worked for the ortho and it cost her nothing.  I used pliers and tweezers.  It took a long time to get them all off but I did it.  My teeth wern't damaged in the least.  I only had them on for a tiny space between my 2 front ones.  But, don't do it.  Someone has probably paid a lot of $$$ for those braces and they may just kick your butt.

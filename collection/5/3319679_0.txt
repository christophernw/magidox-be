In addition to nicotine, cigarette smoke is primarily composed of a dozen gases (mainly carbon monoxide) and tar. The tar in a cigarette, which varies from about 15 mg for a regular cigarette to 7 mg in a low-tar cigarette, exposes the user to an increased risk of lung cancer, emphysema, and bronchial disorders.. . The Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that secondhand smoke causes lung cancer in adults and greatly increases the risk of respiratory illnesses in children and sudden infant death.. Probably the two most serious elements in tobacco smoking are nicotine and tar. The latter generally stains the fingers, lips and teeth, tongue and trachea, and is frequently, but erroneously, called nicotine. Nicotine is an alkaloid present in tobacco, while tar is one of many compounds formed after the tobacco is ignited to form smoke. It is obvious that the products of combustion in smoking cause local irritation of the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. Cancer of the mouth, lips, tongue, larynx and pharynx is more prevelent in smokers than in nonsmokers.

I was raised Christian also. Actually, Catholic. I think God lives within you, in your good deeds and trying to become a better person. I am discusted with my religion. God's priests do not rape little boys, but ours do. That is not my God, the one I chose to believe in. I don't know if this is right or wrong, but I cannot love or support a harmful religion. Organanized religion is just that. Not good for anyone except the powerful and the greedy within it's clutches. . . I hear your frustration, as I feel it, too. I have found meditation, as opposed to "prayer", is very good for the Christian soul. Experience other religions. They are sometimes much more honest and pure.. . Hugs! If you keep searching, you will find the answers.

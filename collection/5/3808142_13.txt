It started at the very first Thanksgiving. The Pilgrims gave the Indians some firewater and after they were PRETTY DARN tipsy, they tried to learn the names of some of the parts of a turkey.. . Well, as you can imagine, it is difficult enough to learn a new language, but try learning it when you are drunk.. . I believe the Chief wanted to say breastbone, but drunk...he said brishbone and over the years it changed to wishbone, cuz it was that bone that people used to make wishes.

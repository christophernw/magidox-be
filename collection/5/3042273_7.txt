As a male, I like to be trampled, or 'stomped' on, as I have an unstable vertebral column, and my vertebrae tend to pressure the spinal nerve.  My wife waking on me puts them back in position. It hurts, but produces profound, if temporary, relief.  Some guys apparently, with no back-problems, like it, but they're 'just a little off.'

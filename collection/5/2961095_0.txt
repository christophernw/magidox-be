Standing up to bullies is necessary because they are cowards at heart.  A good rule to keep in mind is that everyone looks for a victim, but no one looks for an opponent.  If the bully receives little or no resistance, then he or she may continue to do the bullying, but getting resistanace tends to entail a challenge.  Even if resisting the bully is not immediately successful, sooner or later the bully will get the hint.

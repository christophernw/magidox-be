depends where you are. I've had people personally thank me for my service. I've also had college kids yell at throw stuff at my truck when they see the "Combat Veteran - U.S. Marines" decal on my back windshield. I think it's a mixed bag, but most people (whether they support the war or not) respect the sacrifices of the men and women in the military.

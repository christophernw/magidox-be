Oh. My. God.  Lets bash males, shall we?  We SOMETIMES miss the toilet because we have to aim from so far away.  You seal yourself right up against the seat.   But you know what? I've heard of the women's restroom being nasty, too.  You know the hover that you guys do? That's like, what? Four inches away from the toilet?  And you still miss.  So maybe your question should be why do guys make it IN the toilet so often because we are aiming from so far away.  In addition, think of it like a gun where the barrel isn't always pointing the same way.  You never know where its going to go until it goes.  For an example of this (albeit exaggerated) watch Me, Myself, and Irene.  . . I know this is a rant, but I felt somebody needed to explain this to all you (perhaps unintentional) male bashers.  I hope this clears up any misconceptions you had.

if it's not made of rubber sch as wood or metal then, it'll get hammered.... so .....then you won't ride so comfortable..... and then, if it's rubber it has the strength,...and the durability.  By pumping air into them, it becomes as hard as the mettal, so it becomes hard and durable and comfortable.

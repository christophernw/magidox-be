The moisture in the "glue" must evapourate before it can bond.  The inside of the container is not airtight, however there is insufficient air and heat to facillitate evaporation.  Hence, the "glue" is kept in liquid or solid (as in the case of a glue stick) form.  Also, the containers are plastic which doesnt have high affinitiy for many chemicals, further reducing bonding.

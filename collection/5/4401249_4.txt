rather than generalizing the population of the term red neck. i will give you a specific example.. if you are on the way to visit your new love (first cousin in many cases), driving down the highway with your NASCAR  flag flying and  Dale Earnhart lives forever bumper sticker on front and back, with your spit cup in it's window holder and a pack of generic cigarettes in your shirt pocket with a NASCAR butane lighter, and wire coat hanger for the radio antenna, and have a flat tire with a flat spare tire you are probably a red neck.

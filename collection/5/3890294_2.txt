For one thing, Hunan cuisine is less well known, but often even hotter than Szechuan cooking. Both make extensive use of red chili peppers, both to cleanse the palate and possibly to cope with the humid climate.. . I've noticed that, while Szechuan dishes often call for chili paste, Hunan dishes frequently use fresh chili peppers, including the seeds and membranes where most of the heat is contained.

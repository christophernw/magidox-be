you can go with a VGA cord to get 1080i viewing .  If you are connected to xbox live you will automatically receive a download for the 1080i. You will not have to try and find it. But just to make sure, go to system tabs then counsel settings..then click display, then HDTV settings. Let me remind you though, if you do not have a true high def TV (1080) you will only be able to view your games in 720..in order to find out what your tv will support you can look it up online or in your owners manuel.

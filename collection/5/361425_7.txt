I just love ReILL's brilliant Anti-American Leftist retort.  He sounds like a recycled Tom Hayden from the 1960's Radical Left Students for a Democratic Society.  . . On a more serious note.... . Iran's president is attempting to parlay world governance in order to win power... a la a facist dictator, such as Mussolini, or Hitler... He's part of a historical cycle where people come to power and attempt to use force in order to maintain and grow their power.. . Whether or not the United Nations of Terroistic Thugs (Mugabi, et. al) get in bed with this genius or if they decide that we've got enough gravitas to quash him... well that's a toss-up.  The hot-head in Iran better have a helluva lotta money/power/arms in order to satisfy the UN thuggies... or else US and Israel will be knocking on the mullah's door.. . I say SCREW the U.N.  They passed 14 resolutions in order to try to stop Saddam Hussein... did they work?  Hell no.  What's to stop the hot-headed camel jockey in Iran...?  Nothing, except for brute force.  We have the best military in the WORLD.  They are the best at SEEKING and DESTROYING the enemy... I say "Semper Fi... make the enemy die".  . . Enough of the peace mongering lovey dovey diplomacy... SEEK and DESTROY!  The U.N. is a crock of animal dung.  . . What's next?  Are the Democrats gonna defend Iran and Hussein?  Well, one of them is his defense lawyer from the Clinton Administration (oops... sorry lib's).  . . I tell ya... the President needs to get up on the bully pulpit and smack these little snot-nosed punks around and make them mind.

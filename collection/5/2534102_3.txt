Please.  First of all I hate to hear this kind of talk.  You are sterotyping white people.  Maybe you should spend some time North of your border (Canada if you don't know).  We are a little more tolerant of minorities.. . It really boils down to fear.  Americans fear everything.  They fear blacks, they fear Arabs, they fear each other.  Fear spawns hatred.  If Americans could only relax a bit and stop being afraid all the time, maybe you'd be able to get along.

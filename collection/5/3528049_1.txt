Because back in the 70s and 80s a movement to be "politically correct" started so we decided that we didn't want to call people based on their skin color like black or white. White people should actually be called "Caucasian" and not white people. Personally, I couldn't care less about the PC crap and think as long as we are not discriminating based on skin color, who cares?

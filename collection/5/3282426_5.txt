To consider the credibilities of the sources you stated you should consider the following:. The background of the Meduim(Newspaper Publisher, Mag Publisher, Movie or tv Stations owner)Do they have a political adgenda? Are they Concerned about who pays their bills?. Does the writer (all mediums)have a bias when writing about the subject?. . Does the meduim try to present all arguements to a specific subject?. . on a different note, as was said before, All these mediums are not , as would be said "Primary Sources". If it were in court , it would be called "Hearsay". Also history, you should remember is always written by the "Winners". That is to say, old history for the most part is written by the powers that won wars, elections and other historical events.. Finally I would say that the above mediums are reasonable for getting ideas that pique you interest, then go to the books ( Im talking College level or professional level research) and read all you can about the subject. . the key words are " Learn to teach yourself" and "Dont just believe everything your told"

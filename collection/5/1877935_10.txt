There are very few rules in our relationship with God, but a bedrock principle is that all humans have free will and God will not act to obstruct this.  It is the will of God that each of us make our own choice to know and love God.  The limitations of time and space apply to earth dwellers not to God.  So in human/earth time there is a linear progression of events in a time sequence (or the illusion of this) that is not a limitation that God has.  A good example of this is the big bang.  In one-trillionth of second the universe went from the size of the head of a pin to a universe made up of billions of stars dispersed over a space of billions of light years.  Consequently, the totality of human experience can be known at once to God even though this plays out in billions of years in earth time.

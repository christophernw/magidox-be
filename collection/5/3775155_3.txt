put him in a room on his own for 20 mins every time he does it& totally ignore him- if you keep doing it whenever he bites- he'll get fed up being on his own& will get the message because he wants more attention.. Its the only way.. . PS-never hit your dog, it doesnt get u anywhere, trust me.. . -also, use a frickin muzzle!

This finance teacher who just couldn't teach... he got screwed up during a problem and said "hum... well, just don't do it my way and you may get it right in the exam".... you could think he wouldn't put that problem in the exam..  AND HE DID!!. . Another international law teacher who tought NAFTA and European Union were the same thing... I had to correct him several, several times during his lessons (even whenn he had his ppt presentation right, he taught it wrong!!!). . This physics teacher was just great... we were solving this problem, and half of the group said we had to use a positive, and the other half said it was a negative, she was so wise to find a solution in 4 words "ok, girls...letÂ´s vote", democracy won (and it turned to be WRONG!)

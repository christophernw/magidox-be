I'm not a Christian and I'm not going to use the unequally yoked thing because, well, you're both Christians, so I think that's good enough to get you past that.  If he's willing to go with you, ask him to go.  Sure he's just going to make you happy, but if he feels that his relationship with God is where it should be and he's willing to go, then I don't see what's wrong.  Some people are more private about their religion or spirituality.  If he considers himself spiritual, maybe you could ask him about spiritual things he does outside of church and the two of you could share in that.. . And while I don't buy into the Christians should only date Christians thing, I do believe that religious differences can break a relationship.  If the relationship is serious and you have problems with religious issues such as this, you may want to ask yourself if you'll be able to handle it.  I think that with mutual respect, people of differing beliefs can make a relationship work, but only if both people are okay with the fact that the other person is of a different religion, or in this case denomination.  Good luck to the two of you!

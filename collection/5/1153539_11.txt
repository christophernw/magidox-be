Well, if you have a hobby or interest how about a job in that field?. Or just start a list of all the things you like doing - have a look round your house.  If I came 'round what would I see so that I could say 'This woman has a real passion for...'?  Ask yourself if you like to be social, work with other people, travel, hands-on, be creative, be physically active, work outdoors, writing - anything you can think of at all.. You should be able to figure out, in broad terms, what you like and what you do not like doing.  You may even fond there is something which is obvious but maybe you hadn't really thought about doing for a living.. I'd say get try getting some life-coaching, experts who deal with people in your situation all the time.. Also, remember that you can go and do anything next and not worry about it being 'right' or 'wrong' just a new experience.. . Anyway hope that helps, good luck!

And Americans have bigger egos, lower morals, higher national debt, execute their own citizens, a history of slavery, need i go on. The number 1 reason Canada is so different than the U.S. is that we are educated in world history, not just regional history. We are aware of how ignorance breeds fear and recognize founding nations by being a bi-lingual nation and welcome people from other cultures. We believe that bigger fences do not make for better neighbours and that guns kill people, still can't figure how people shoot people without a gun(NRA argument). We both began from basically the same roots, we chose to grow, that is the difference.. . This is for Max-  Canada entered both world Wars years ahead of the U.S. whooped your butts in 1812 , burnt your White House, fought in the Korean War, are in Afghanistan with you, etc.

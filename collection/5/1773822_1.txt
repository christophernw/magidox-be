Google this: "@companyname.com". You will likely find an email address for someone at that company. You can quickly learn the email address protocol for that compnay (e.g., firstname.lastname@, or firstname_lastname@).  Assuming you have name of the Chairman, then just apply the Chairman's name to the protocol (e.g., tom.smith@companyname.com) ans send away. It may take a little trial and error to get it right.

Because in many other countries, it's necessary to speak more than one language, primarily because of the border proximities.  For example, I know many people in Belgium who are fluent in English, Flemish, French, Spanish, German and Italian.  That's because they learn them early in life in order to communicate effectively with their neighbors.  Additionally, English is known as the "language of business" around the world.

For information on artists living or dead, try sites like: "absolutearts.com" or "worldwidearts.com" and type in whatever you have--artist name, type of work, style of work, medium used, size, etc. Is it a print, a painting, a photograph, an original, a copy? a numbered lithograph print is a lot different than a giclee print. These things all effect the value, as does the condition.. . If the artist is dead, a gallery link might pop up. A gallery dealing with the works or the estate of an artist can give you a lot of useful information, might be able to tell you the value and if there is a market for the work. If you are looking to get a piece appraised, do as much research as you can on it first. If it's a print, that is a different kind of dealer than if you have an original oil painting. A print might be more appropriate for an antiques dealer while a painting might be more appropriate for a gallery to appraise. Museums do very little if any outside appraisal. They do not have the time or the staff to offer that service.

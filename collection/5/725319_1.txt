It is a safe country and a good place to raise and educate kids.On the negative side ,if you are a new immigrant and have foreign education and experience ,your chance of getting a job in your field is almost zero.Canada does not put a serious effort to absorb the immigrants into its marketplace.. Also the health system ,although covers all residents for Free,is a very slow system and patients could die waiting for treatments .There are no private clinics or hospitals and one is basically under the mercy of the family doctor,if he finds one !!

Depending on their health and weight, labs may live up to 17 human years. (That is IF nothing goes wrong and they stay perfectly healthy their whole life) Other than that, I'd say you've got 10 to 12 years with her. Don't worry about it, I've got two labs, both whose parents are still mating at ages 10-12.

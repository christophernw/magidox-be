depends why u have them!!!. . The best way tho is to sit with your ankles raised above waist level (to help drain them) and if u can bear it put something cold on them (to help reduce additional fluid build up) but wrap the cold thing (eg frozen peas) in a towel first.  Also if you have any over the counter anti inflamitories that will help but please read the instructions first! And do not take anythin if u are pregnant without your drs permision!

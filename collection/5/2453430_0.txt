All depends on how long they are in business if is brand new one they have to calculate the amount of clients to expect otherwise go slowly and after a week or so they have an idea of the clients flow.I think if you start with a short menu and do everything fresh and to order you wont waste much and don't forget the homeless better feed then than throw away.

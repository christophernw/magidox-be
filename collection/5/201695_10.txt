To use beta blockers for anxiety attacks in my opinion is inappropriate. It will lower your blood pressure and heart rate.It is not an addictive medication. Finding the underlying cause would be beneficial,exercise,meditation, and a short duration of an anti-anxiety medication could help ie xanax,ativan (these can be addictive but not if used properly) Anxiety and especially panic attacks can be very debilitating. Counseling would help also. I hope you get better soon.

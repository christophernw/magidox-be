I won't ask what kind of sites you wish to disappear.  . . Above the address bar go to Tools - Internet Options - the first screen should have a button to clear your history.  Clear it.  On the tab of the box is Security - click on it and towards the bottom of the screen will read Auto-Complete.  Clicking on that will lead to another screen which will give you the option to clear out the auto-completes some people have in their search bars.  . . Hope that helps delete those naughty sites that you have "accidently" stumbled on.

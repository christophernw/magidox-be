If god created humans than he should fired for being totally incompetent.... . Humans and apes have a common ancestor. That ancestor does not exist anymore. Proof of this is the fact that chimps and humans have the exact same flaw in our vitamin C gene: it doesnÂ´t work. Unlike most other animals we need to eat vitamin C constantly or we will die. . . Maybe god just had a hangover when he created humans and chimps. Or maybe he is a sadist. Or maybe he never existed at all. What would you rather believe?

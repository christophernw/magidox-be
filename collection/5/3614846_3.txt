Could be because the fuse is shot, on some vehicles, there is fuse for turning light on and another one for signaling and yet they are wired to same spot. Check out both fuses. they are not located in same spot as all other fuses, in some cars they look like a small round cylinder and under the dash board. If you get it working then you can test it before you put your dash cover back on.  Its, a bi-ee-ch to get at.

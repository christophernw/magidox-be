Then we'd live in a democracy. At the moment, we live in a representative republic, where the people elect politicians to represent their views.. . There are no actual democracies in the world today. The Greeks and Romans had a form of democracy, but voting then was limited to the rich; slaves did not get to vote - so even there it wasn't a true democracy.. . A democracy is unworkable for two reasons - you cannot organize the voting effectively for every issue, and the people cannot spend sufficient time to study each issue so that they can make informed decisions - if they did, they wouldn't have time for work.. . A representative democracy, such as our republic, is the best available compromise. Not perfect, but it does generally represent the views of the people.

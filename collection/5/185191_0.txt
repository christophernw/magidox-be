Well...cocaine gives you a gross red runny nose..too much and it'll bleed...not very chic.Or if you shoot it abscesses, and tract marks..even worse! Not to mention those blank orbs for eyes...  Alcohol in high doses makes you incoherent, puke, and stagger..never seen a drunk on the cover of Cosmo...in their drunken state...thankfully today glam isn't the 80's party, its more natural- yoga, spas..and good food...

you start by drawing a horatonzial line, then put a point in the center of that line called the vanishing poit, now when you draw a house or a table all the lines coming off the flat wall extends to that vanishing point on the horatzonttal line, of course dont draw the table to the VP just enough to give it demsion, it can also get more complicated when you add multiple vp's and horazontal lines (the HL everything below the line goes up everything above goes down, you can varay the HL anywhere on the paper and the VP anywhere on that line.) =)

Firstly, if you have brought a single ticket and for some reasons did not like your flight you are unlikely to travel with that airline again.  Secondly, most countries will not allow you to enter unless you have a return ticket the airline knows this and it is better for them to make it cheaper for you to get the return ticket required then have the opption of using a different airline when returning to your country.

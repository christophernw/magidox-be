christmas is a pagan festival , 100% NO link to Christianity or the Bible.. so it's even OKAY if Christians REFUSE to celebrate it... and Jesus wasnt born on Christmas, He was born somewhere late sept to early october.. . yeap, so its okay if athiest celebrate christmas :DD. its just a season for giving/receiving :D. and meeting up with friends/relatives.. etc.

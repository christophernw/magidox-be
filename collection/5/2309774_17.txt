i give mad props to our soldiers. i know i don't have the BALLS to do what they do. granted it is a bullshit reason we are over there (Iraq, Afghanistan) but i would rather have the fighting over there than here in the united states. if anyone has a problem wit our men and women at war than take it up with your congress people not our troops, they are just doing what their "boss" (Bush) told them to do.

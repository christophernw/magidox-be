The second heart tone, or S2, is caused by the sudden block of reversing blood flow due to closure of the aortic valve and pulmonic valve at the end of ventricular systole, i.e beginning of ventricular diastole. As the left ventricle empties, its pressure falls below the pressure in the aorta, aortic blood flow quickly reverses back toward the left ventricle and is stopped by aortic (outlet) valve closure. Similarly, as the pressure in the right ventricle falls below the pressure in the pulmonary artery, the pulmonic (outlet) valve closes. The S2 sound results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal

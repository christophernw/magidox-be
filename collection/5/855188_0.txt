well, i think u should give in to the craving but not completely.  first u have to know that it's an addiction that can ruin your life.  i'll advice to just take ONE STRONG puff, savor it and move on.  you must convince yourself that u've satisfied your craving and move on.  occupy your time and mind with something else.  perhaps volunteering at a rehab center for a little while mite change your perspective on this "craving"

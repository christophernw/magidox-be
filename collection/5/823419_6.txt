I believe one has to systematically calm oneself down.  One has to quieten the voice / confusion / turmoil within.  In order to do this it helps to know that there really are only four basic feelings - you can feel happy about something, sad, angry, and/or scared.  . . If you grab feelings as they come into focus and one by one force yourself to define them as a happy, sad, angry or scared feeling this is a good start.  It may also help to say for that particular feeling how strong it is relative to others.  Then, in addition, if you can, try to figure out why you're feeling that feeling.  Could it be to do with your need for certainty, connection, variety, growth, to feel significant, or your need to make a contribution?. . After a while, possibly a long while, you'll get on top of all those feelings whirring around inside you.  This in itself will help you feel calmer, more at peace, more self-aware.  . . To go further one can even take each feeling, and figure out all options that one could take based on that feeling, whether it is a happy one or not.  One may not choose to take any of these options, but just considering them can have a good calming effect.  . . Once you've totally got on top of your feelings you really are about to make a life-changing discovery.  Happy to discuss this further with you if you like.  Just let me know.

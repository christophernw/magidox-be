Sodium Chlorite (NaClO) that is dissolved in water makes up the active part of the bleaching solution.  The chlorite ion acts as an oxidizer which breaks down the oils, greases, and other compounds in stains.  However, it's this oxidizing action that also breaks down the dye molecules that give clothes distinct colors.

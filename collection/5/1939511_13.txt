They use sterilized needles, prepackaged not enclaved at the correctional facility. Health code requirements is one reason why. And in some states when someone dies from unother than natural causes and autopsy is required. Wouldn't that be peachy, execute a person send them for autopsy and they find something unother than the chemicals used for the injection procedure in the deceased's system? Like Clorox. Inmates love spiking stuff with clorox.

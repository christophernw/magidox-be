What u can do is find a store that sells really cheap things like Big Lots or u can ask a friend if they have old Christmas stuff that's in good condition if u can have it. As for decorating you house, I would say on the outside, try decorating a couple of trees with lights, put a santa in a sled with reign deer in the front, and if u want to go crazy, u should put a snow man or the santa stuff on your roof. Also try putting a couple of snow men in your fron lawn.

The best job I ever had was a camp counselor. I did it for years before I got a full time job. I used to teach sailing, water skiing, and rock climbing. I got to go out every night with other counselors. We always got to have summer romances. Then as I got older I got the cooler positions in camp. My last year as a counselor I ran an adventure program. I traveled all over the US in a van and went rock climbing, white water rafting, caving, backpacking, and kayaking! All expenses paid vacation for like three months!! The kids I worked with were 14 or 15 so it wasn't like babysitting anymore and they had to help with all the work like collecting wood for campfires and cooking. I still miss that job. . I have included one website that has a summer camp directory so you can find camps in your area. There are lots of camps to check out though. Make sure they are ASA certified! That is the American Camping Association. It is a sign of a quality camp.

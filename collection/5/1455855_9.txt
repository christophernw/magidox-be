Traditionally it was that the woman's age should be half the man's age plus seven years. Example: if he's 35, she should be 24.. . But nowadays, its whatever works for the couple. The only reasons great differences in age should be viewed with caution are:. . A) Their life experiences are probably greatly different as change is so rapid these days.. . B) Their physical capacities might be very different as well and not just in the bedroom. . . Yet even these are no longer considered insurmountable. I would say about your case, however, he'd jolly well better be a MATURE 21, or he's gonna drive you up the wall. Males that age are rarely ready to settle down and get on with their lives. They're still rather juvenile about it all.. . Good luck anyway!

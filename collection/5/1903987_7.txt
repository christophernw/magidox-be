wow... luckily our coyotes never came that close to the farm... they stayed by the woods.. . we had a problem with our golden retriever as he was growing up.  he would chase the cats because he wanted to "play." unfortunately, he'd get a hold of the slower cats :kittens, old ones... and he'd hurt them while trying to "play."  he was also very sneaky... and he'd catch so many.  our solution was to attach a cowbell to his collar.  sure enough it worked! the cats always had fair warning and could scurry before he got close.  too bad this solution won't work for coyotes!!!

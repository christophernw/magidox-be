If you want the repair to last, use a new panel, or cut and weld in a patch. If you just want to get by for a year or two, use some hardware cloth, (kinda like screen door material with about 1/4" holes). Rivet, or screw it to the cleaned hole, then spread body filler. This won't last forever, but its easy and cheap.

Tracy, I would send you the case, but apparently there are no email links here (?)  Anyway,  here's the summary:. . The wife had lied to her husband prior to the marriage about her marital history. The wife said she had been married twice, with one marriage ending with the death of the other spouse and one by divorce. In fact, the wife had been married four times. Each of those marriages ended in divorce. There was no legal impediment to the marriage of the husband and wife and they lived together as husband and wife for almost 10 years before the wife filed her action. The marriage was consummated by intercourse. The trial court annulled the marriage based on the wife's misrepresentations. The appellate court held that, despite the wife's lies, the marriage was neither void nor voidable. The trial court had therefore erred in annulling the marriage.

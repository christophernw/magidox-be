It was the TOWER of BABEL I believe. The language of God is not english. Anyways, I am not sure if you have read the part in the bible where he changes everyones language when they where building the tower, because they where doing to defy god, and prove that they where powerful. And so he did that so they where not able to understand eachother and complete the building.

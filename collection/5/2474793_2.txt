To "doublethink" is holding two contradictory beliefs at the same time and believing in both. It's an integral part of George Orwell's novel 1984. In Frank Herbert's novel, Dune, the Muad'Dib comments that kindness is the same as cruelty, which are opposing sides yet could mean what is kind to one person could be unkind (cruel) to another, therefore can be considered as doublethinking.

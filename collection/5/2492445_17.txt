Beef sounds better. It  conjures up a better/more stomach-appealing image rather than "dead cow" or "slaughtered chicken".  Actually sometimes I refer to beef as dead cow, especially when driving past In-N-Out and it smells like nasty hamburger.. . Also, I think beef/poultry refer more so to the actual meat cuts rather than the entire cow or chicken.

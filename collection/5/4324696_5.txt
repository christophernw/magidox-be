Like those TV evangelists what do they do with all that money that they become wealthy with.  Why do people believe that giving money to another man who is already rich gets them into heaven.  That is so stupid.. This guy told how to become rich with real estate and wrote a book.  It was totally bogus but he became rich because he sold so many books.. this lady was really fat and lost weight by diet and exercise and said, it was these pills.  Made a fortune off the pills.. Or that guy who ate submarine sandwiches.  Jared. However, religion is not only a lot of money but it is tax free.

It's 10:20 p.m. Northern Minnesota, USA. and the air is a little chilly, about 37 degrees. Yesterday it was way way windy. Last night we had frost. For this time of the year though it's unseasonably warm. The buds are coming out on the trees already. That usually doesn't happen until next month. Enjoy your day.........

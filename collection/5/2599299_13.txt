There are a combination of factors at work. But you should use what you already know about the person as a basis. Then notice whether they make eye contact. Listen to what they say and how they say it, ie tone and inflection and/or emphasis. Body language can also be a dead giveaway. Basic body language like folding the arms is a defensive pose usually used to protect from perceived/possible threat indicating the presence of a lie. Also be aware of what a person is not saying. In other words reading between the lines. Lastly but never leastly listen to your initial and gut feeling. It will never steer you wrong. If you are genuinely conflicted then maybe it is because you are trying to overide your gut feeling with mental logic. This is what causes most confusion in people in these situations.

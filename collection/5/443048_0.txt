It is difficult being a female in situations like this--fortunatley you were with a friend that understands and will help "bail you out" of those that get too hard.  Some women thrive on that and take advantage of it---they are called tramps amongst other things (or soon to be exwives) You should still make it a point to things like that and bring your husband once in a while too---which I know you do

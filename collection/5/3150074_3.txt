We do not know with certainty. Its one of the problems of quantum gravity.. . If gravity behaved like every other force, then you are right that we would not be able to "see" gravity from outside a black hole. Its not just light that cannot escape - if you had an electron just inside a black hole and one just outside the one outside would feel no electrostatic force from the one inside for instance. How odd is that.. . So it clearly gravity does not behave like the other forces. But physicists would like to unify it with the other forces. They just don't know how yet.

It is a kinda long term adaptation.. The sperms are to be fetched inside the female reproduction organ.. OK just take an example of filling gasoline in car the liquid (like sperms) are put by some kinda pipe, and hey for easyness the meter is also outside!. So, nature always prefer easyness, and its relatively easy if these stuffs are outside the body.

I think the problem is that you don't come across many older people in your everyday life.  The older generation does speak differently to us and some older peoples speech is affected by their hearing deteriorating.  Maybe volunteering to help old people would help you to overcome this barrier.  Well done for getting so far with your English, I hope you conquer this barrier.. . Good luck!

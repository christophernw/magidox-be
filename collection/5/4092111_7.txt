If you exercise one area more than the other it doesn't means this is the spot that will improve (unfortuntately). . . Generally we lose weight/fat from head to toe. As a run of thumb I would go running cause it is the best way to shed inches off your frame from head to toe build up to 1 hour three times a week. Spin is also another great cardio burner but you need a gym. Doing weights is also great cause it reduces cellulite so combining weights with lunges and squats are absolutely fabulous if your not with a gym just get some bottles of water to act as hand weights and as you get better get bigger bottles or cans. . . Hope it all works out!

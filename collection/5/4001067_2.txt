This can actually be very difficult because we all pronounce words differently.  For example, how do you pronounce "fire"? Is it one or two syllables?  Some people pronounce it "fi-yer," while others say something that sounds like "far."  . . Your best bet is to write the poetry (I'm assuming), and if you have strict prosody rules from your teacher, look the words up in a dictionary to find the "standard" syllable break down.  If this isn't for a class, then I say, "Use your own dialect and make it sound beautiful!"

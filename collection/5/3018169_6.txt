The thing is... DON'T TAKE CARE OF IT!!!!!. . it is the Rabbit's nature to leave their young during the day so predators don't attack them. the mother rabbit will come at night to feed their young.. . This is why people assume that these baby rabbits are abandoned. I just had a litter of baby rabbits and i observed this with the mother.

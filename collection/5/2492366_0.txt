let me ask you people who think the seal hunt is wrong: if your children were starving and the only source of income in your frozen and desolate Gaspe bay house was to go out and kill seal for a living what would you choose you stupid hypocritical idiots. not to mention that the large number of seals in the ocean due to the previous cancellation of the seal hunt was a large factor in the collapse of the east coast fisheries. i don't think that that stupid Paul McCartney or WTF his name is can say anything when his a$$ is sitting in some British manor drinking expensive tea.

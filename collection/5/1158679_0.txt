Hi,.  I shop a lot and to save time and money I use cheapest prices search engine. Almost every merchant is there and over a million consumer written reviews. You will find many other ways that will help you with questions..  You can shop online or you can go to a merchant and use the toll free phone number if you feel more comfortable shopping like that..  There are merchant reviews, product reviews, compare by brand and a lot more. I hope I helped you and I wish you good luck.

The Catholic church has a policy on tolerating critism.  In other words it won't fight back.  So the bristling throng of cowards in the world like to throw rocks at it.  Does anyone complain that being homosexual is practically a death sentance in most islamic communities?  Or that women are systematically raped and it is called "Honor"? Or ostrisized from the jewish faith for marring outside of your religion?  no.  Thanks to terrorism and politics ain't no shivering little twerp is going to say boo.  If the Church said, "I'm comming after everyone who screws with me" it would stop

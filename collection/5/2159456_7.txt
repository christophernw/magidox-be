Fill up two ice cube trays one with warm water one with cold see which freezes faster.  I've heard that the warm water would be faster but I don't buy it, doesn't the warm water have to get cold first to freeze?  So since the cold water is already cold that should save time.  Let me know when you figgure this one out.

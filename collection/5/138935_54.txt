high five to the host of this question. I just got my second canker sore, and this one put me throught the worst of time. I was so mad at myself for getting this thing. Like I just gotten some kind of disease. I was lossing it because I thought since my lower lip was swelling up. I wasnt gonna have a kissing date this weekend. but now I can relaxe. I found out from reading this ad, my toothpaste that i didnt want to part with (bubble gum favor ) had sodium in it. and I when I ran out of Koolaide last week, I used tea bags. But that all good. I wash/rinsed my mouth. but not just with salt water like most people here said I added one teaspoon white distilled vinegar and that left out the sting. and removed my dry peeling skin. and the swelling that moment. I feel great. soon I'll be ready for my weekend kiss. thanks siters.

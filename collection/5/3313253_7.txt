It won't come overnight, but you can get very rich on the internet.  It's a whole new frontier with unlimited possibilities.. . Start by joining an affiliate program.  It will teach you how to make money online, and how to be a success at whatever you do.  There is a wealth of wonderful education to help you make it really big. . . After you have succeeded with the affiliate program, start your own business on the web.  By that time you will have developed a ton of ideas, and been able to boil them down to one or two things you really want to do.. . The next step would be to go offline and invest in some kind of real estate, or other local business investment.. . This way you will have at least three sources of significant income.  If one fails, the other two will just keep bringing in the cash.. . You might even become wealthy.  Rich is having more money coming in each month than you are using. Wealthy is when you don't have to work at all unless you want to.. . Good Luck!. . PS. The web is also full of scams posing as affiliate programs.  Here are some that are solid, paying companies. Enjoy!

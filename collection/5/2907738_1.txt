The easiest way is to ask someone to look for you.  If you feel something under your eyelid, that kind of feels like it is scratching your eyelid then you probably have something in your eye. If there is blood or a projectile involved you should see a Dr.. It sounds like you scratched it, try covering both of your eyes so that they will rest in the evenings or before you go to bed.

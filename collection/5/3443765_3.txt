The parable of the Wheat and Darnel explains this so well. They were talking about this in a discussion group on ewtn tonight and it related so well to this story - it hit me like a rock. Some of the commentaries below this are from what people said on television that I am repeating here.. . 24 Jesus gave them another parable: "The Kingdom of heaven is like this story. A farmer planted high quality wheat seed in his field. 25 But, as everyone slept, an enemy of the farmer quietly approached, planted weeds in the wheat field, and escaped. 26 When the wheat plants sprouted and showed new grain, so did the weeds. 27 The workers in charge of the field said to the farmer, "Sir, you planted quality seed in the field, didn't you? Where did the weeds come from?" 28 "An enemy did this, " the farmer replied. "Do you want us to pull the weeds?" the workers asked. 29 "No, " said the farmer, "when you pull the weeds, you might pull the wheat out at the same time. 30 Let them grow together until harvest time. Then I will tell the harvest workers, 'First, pull the weeds. Then, tie them into bundles so they can be burned. But, put all the wheat together in the my barn.'". . ------------------------------------------. . So God did not plan for evil. The enemy put it there. Yet God does not want to pull up all the weeds because the wheat will be destroyed too. He has faith in the wheat. Don't make an early harvest - in other wards - don't pull the weeds your self or wish for God to pull them up. The harvest will come when the Lord wills it. Just prepare yourself so that you make it to the barn with the rest of the wheat and not to be burned with the darnel. There are weeds among us. Yet we grow stronger because of them.

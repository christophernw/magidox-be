I saw this once on Eureka! TV.. Get the plastic tiny ballon-like wrap, you know the ones that are used to wrap furniture/glass-dishes ect. ( I'm not so sure what its called) Use a sewwing pin and pop it at one side then fill it up with custard. You must be careful to get the custurd inside it. Then cover up the open side with plasticine and stick it your face.. Cheers.

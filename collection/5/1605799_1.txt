The way you calculate the electrons is this: You look at the number under which the element is placed (not the weight,this one is the larger one). If it has 19 protons, that's what it means. That's exactly the number  of electrons, because #protons=#electrons. Now, if you are dealing with ion, you have to look at the charge. If it is  positive, that means that that's how many electrons(- charge) have been taken away. Substract that number from the original number of electrons-you got your answer!

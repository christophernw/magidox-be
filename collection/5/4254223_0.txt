I am a Tomboy! Tomboy's are a balanced mixture of Masculine and Feminine, we are the best of both worlds all wrapped into one. I can't speak for others, only for myself as far as your questions goes. Before i retired i was a custodian, i love to work with my hands, i listen to all kinds of music, I write poetry. I wear Jeans, Wifebeaters, Boxerbriefs, and Wrestling Shoes, i go to the barber shop every 2 weeks to get my hair cut. I am proud to say that i'm a Tomboi.

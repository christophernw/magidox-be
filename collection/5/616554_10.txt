This does not yank my sympathy chain at all - I disagree with the anchor baby law and want that ended asap.  When the parents were deported, they had the right to take their children with them and so they should have done if they cared anything for their children, at all.  If they have given up the care and custody of their children and under the present archaic law those children are considered US citizens and the parents decided it would be in their children's best interests to remain in the US, then place those children in foster homes or adoptive homes and they will be fine.  Change the law now, though, and in future deport the children along with the parents.  The parents were at fault for having their children in the USA in the first place, trying to use the generous US system to their own advantage.  Ship 'em out!

check for vacuum leak with hood open at throttle top,. 90* turn at top has leak all the time! just rubber.... pull vacuum line to fuel psi regulator. if gas comes out as you crank it / run engine, you need a $ 80 fuel rail regulator. :o) if not, hook up a fuel psi gauge to the filter and use a tech scope ( like a doctor's stethascope). to listen to each fuel injector, 1 or 2 may " leak " as the fuel pressure will drop after each key cycle. have autozone or murry's scan your pcm for oxygen sensor codes or misfire codes. you may just need a good tune up with coil pack and 2 or 4 oxygen sensors. worst thing is you drive too far and melt down a $1000 set of catalitic converters! ouch...

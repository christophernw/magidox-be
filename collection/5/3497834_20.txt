Much better to live on Earth.After all, the Earth WAS created for mankind.One day the Earth will be a beautiful place to reside.Remember, the opposite of life is death.When one dies, he or she cannot see, speak, feel and are conscious of nothing at all (that would include experiencing joy, as well as pain).Let the Creator do his thing.His plan will come true.Perhaps you will get to see what I mean one day.Since nobody knows the day or the hour, we just need to be patient.. P.S.Heaven is the Creator's domain.(and His Son's)

When shoes squeak on smooth surfaces it is usually the rubber sole slipping slightly.  If they squeak on all surfaces it is usually a metal or hard plastic shank molded into the sole that has worn loose and is rubbing against the rubber sole.  Getting the show wet will often make this worse.  Dr. Martens are notorious for this.

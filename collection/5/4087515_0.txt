Not sure but is it possible that there could be medical complications arising at some point later in time due to excessive marching or anything?  Sounds really ignorant on my part but can your bones break easily or anything?  Medical is the only thing I can think of....Military anywhere is not big on spending money for something that was done/happened prior to enlistment if something were to happen medically.

Cats meow because it's the only way they know to get our attention.  When cats speak to each other, they never make any noise.  The only exceptions to this are when they're fighting, then they make all sorts of terrible noises.  Body language is the key to all communication, whethere it's cats or humans.  A woman who twirls her hair around her finger when she knows a guy is looking at her is sending him a message that she'd be open to him coming over to talk to her.  A man who wants to appear a little more attractive to a woman might suck in his gut a bit and puff out his chest.  If you watch cats when they interact with each other, you'll have no problem picking up their language.  A fast twitching tail means they're annoyed or angry.  A slow moving tail suggests being calm and at ease.  If they roll over and expose their stomachs to you, they're feeling playful.  It's just a matter of watching and learning.  Body language is the easiest language to learn, since most of us use body language without any real conscious thought.

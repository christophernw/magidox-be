its the first time i hear that comment for greeks. i am greek myself and i have thousands of foreign friends, they all had great time in greece, people here are always willing to help, open hearted and fun. honestly you are the only person that believes something like that! i dont know how you got that impression but in case you met one greek you didnt like, that certainly doesnt mean all greeks are the same..

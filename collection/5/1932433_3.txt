Most of the direct evidence of the composition and state of the layers of the Earth comes from carefully studying seismographs taken after earthquakes and other events.. . By studying the speed, refraction and shadows of the shockwave from an earthquake as it travels through the Earth, scientists can determine what sort of material the pressure wave was traveling through.. . Certain types of waves travel well through solid material, but cannot propagate through fluids.  If the seismic detector is on the other side of a liquid layer from the epicenter of an earthquake, it will not be able to detect those kinds of waves.  This gives evidence not only of the liquid layers, but also the size of that liquid layer by comparing different seismographic readings from around the world.. . Independent evidence of a liquid core is the presence of a magnetic field around the Earth.  Current theories on how the magnetic field form require motion within a molten layer of a ferrous substance (like iron) to produce this field.  Earth's possession of a magnetic field is pretty good evidence that there is a molten layer of iron down there.  Mars and the Moon do not have magnetic fields, thus indicating that if they did have molten cores at one time, they have cooled sufficiently that they no longer spin.. . Those are the main ways.

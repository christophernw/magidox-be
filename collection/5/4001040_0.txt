"Slums are usually characterized by high rates of poverty and unemployment and are breeding centers for many social problems such as crime, drug addiction, alcoholism, and despair. In many poor countries they are also breeding centers for disease due to unsanitary conditions. Though the terms are often now used interchangeably, slums and ghettoes differ in that ghettoes originally referred to a neighborhood based on shared ethnicity. Slums are also different to favelas or shanty towns, in that they consist of permanent (if low-quality) housing rather than temporary shacks."

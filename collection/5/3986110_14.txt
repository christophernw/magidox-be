I just returned home from seeing." A Prairie Home Companion."  I really enjoyed it, but I don't think that young kids would.  Prior to that I was on my computer organizing my work schedule for this summer.  Prior to that I was taking a neighbor of mine, an elderly person,  out for a ride.  She is a friend of mine who is getting quite old.  I know she will leave me someday, so I'm cherishing the time we have together. It's been a full, happy day.

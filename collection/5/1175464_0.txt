I was told by interviewers . Sell yourself they want to hear how good you are no matter how conceited it may sound to yourself they are looking for team workers, confidence, anyone willing to take on more learning for the benefit of the particular job, present yourself well look the person you are trying to sell...as for weakness be honest unless has already been said its likely to lesson your chances of getting the job...so you could say i dont believe i have a weakness but if it were pointed out to me i have i am willing to take on board any suggestions or help to work on it .......but also keep in mind not all weakness are bad things to have.

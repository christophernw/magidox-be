He did take dinosaurs on the ark.  They died later, after they had gotten off of the ark.. . Genesis 6:19-22:. "You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.  Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.  You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them."  Noah did everything just as God commanded him.

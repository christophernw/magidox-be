You are absolutely correct.. They dare not put Saddam Hussein on a fair trail in an International court as he would implicate most of the people who want him dead and need to shut his mouth.. Most if not all of the weapons he had came from the USA.. The USA wanted to get back at Iran for the hostage issue and used Iraqi lives to do it.. They later fell out as he would not allow Bechtel to run the Iraqi oil industry.. Most all of the money Iraq obtained came from the BNL bank in Atlanta USA.. The USA extended the Kuwait border 50 km into south Iraq and into the Iraqi oilfields after the Gulf War and have stolen Iraqi oil since 1991.. It is a disgrace - who should also go on trial with Saddam, a lot of USA politicians.

Because we are an enlightened, to a point, country that doesn't punish people according to their lifestyles.  Religion is the only reason it would be criminalized and religion doesn't run this government.  Why would you want to imprison people just for living their life?  Maybe there is something you have about your life that some would consider objectionable; do you want to go to prison for it?

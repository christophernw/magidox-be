Not real familiar with that model, but on most all cars, you loosen the belts( by looseing the nut holding the alt., etc.) remove the bolts from fan to clutchfan, you may have to work the fan around to get it clear, then remove the clutch, replace the clutch, then fan to clutch, then retighten the belts.If you have a fan shroud, it may make it alittle difficult to work in such a tight area, but it can be done. Good Luck

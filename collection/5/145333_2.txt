I'm studying to be a historian and you do have to use deductive powers.When we look at a primary source we have to not only look at what it literally says to you, (witting testimony), we have to deduce what other meanings it may hold. Perhaps something the writer mentioned only in passing or something that they were just not concious of (unwitting testimony). You also have to piece together the events of a particular period and other documentary or visual evidence with this testimony to make sense of it all.

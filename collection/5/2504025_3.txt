i believe the answer to that lies in the brains ability to predict our own movements, and anticipate reactions, hence it is difficult to augh when tickling our own feet. When someone else tickles us we are unable to predict what they are going to do (even if we know what they are going to do, and how it will feel.  (sometimes its possible to laugh before the event, as i guess we recognise the action and the result.The laughter is a release of that energy, in a way that make us feel comfortable, as we can also deduce that the activity is non-threatening.

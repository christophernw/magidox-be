your cars computer has an error code. this means that something needs attention on your car. Any decent car shop can  read your car's error code and can then correct the problem. then the check engine light should turn off if they clear the code and fix it.  but you should take it somewhere so they can see what code is making the check engine light come on.. you can do this yourself but you would need an obd2 diagnostics tool and knowledge of what the codes mean.

There could be any of a number of reasons to answer a question. The obvious one being that people, perusing a list of questions, find one as absurd as yours and want or maybe compulsively need to add thier own absurdity. Another obvious one would be the points, or boredom. Quite possibly, thier high school english teacher told them to go find a question and answer it. Me, I am sitting in Iraq, waiting to go to work, because I cannot sleep. But what I really want to know is how is it that some of the same people who called you an idiot on this page state thier love of god and man on another page.

i used to HATE water. but i started to drink flavored water, and it was ok. then i went to bottled water and i like it now! I still cant stand tap water or even filtered, but i eazed into bottled water, and now i cant stop drinking it! Plus just think of what could happen if you dont drink water?!!!. Good Luck

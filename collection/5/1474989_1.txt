I've heard from many who believe in god that the god of Christian understanding is a god who allows choice.  This includes the choice to believe in him or not, and the choice to shoot up heroin or not.  If god were to interviene, he would not be allowing choice.  Or, more precisely, he would not be allowing humans to be responsible for the actions that they take.

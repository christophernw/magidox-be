Murder is against the law.  That's the most important reason why we care who killed Kennedy.  Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy.  He acted alone.  The evidence is clear.. . There were only 3 shots fired, the first one hit the curb, the second one hit Kennedy in the back of the neck and the third one hit him in the back of the head.  The autopsy bears this out.

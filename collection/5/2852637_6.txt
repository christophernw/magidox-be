Do you really live in England. I thought the English had more respect for their stomach. We will be glad to send you some of our classier garbage, oops , I mean fast food. Do you have a good plumbing system there? I bet you own some stock in one of the companies like Bromo Seltzer. NO? you should! Then if we keep up our end, you must promise enough customers to make our little business in the black. You need to realize we are not in the business of making a very spicy Yorkshire Pudding. Actually I like Taco Bell. Better you miss than me, hey!. See the English do not have a lock on all the best!

A Protestant was originally a Christian that protested against practices of the Catholic Church, such as buying salvation or having to go through a priest to get to God. Protestants believe in a personal relationship to God, that you can speak to Him directly without a mediator like a priest or Mary. Today, Protestants have many denominations such as Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Pentecostal.

she must be very uncomfortable. there are OTC eat mite meds. if she is very stressed it could  cause her to produce less milk for the pups and she could give them (mites) to the pups. They are not visible to the naked eye so it could be that the ears are just extremely dirty. you could start by putting some olive oil into the ears by dropper. massage the ear canal(bottom of ear) and the dog will shake her head to send black chunks flying out. wipe out the ear canal with paper towels...no Q-tips! they will just pack the dirt tighter into the ear. The ears must be treated and it would be best to do it before the dog starts the constant head shaking that can produce hematomas. good luck

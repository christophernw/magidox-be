Sleep on your side after you put some aloe vera on those sunburns, it helped me after I was severely sunburned 5 1/2 years ago on a canoing trip, but I didn't have the luxury of aloe vera at the time. Also you should eat a lot of healthy foods that can lower the toxins in your body because of the burn,  the best foods are: broccli, onions, oranges, apples and strawberries, these foods are very hight in antitoxins.  Hope you feel better soon!

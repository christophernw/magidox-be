Unfortunately there is not much media coverage about the problems of the enviroment, stories about melting icebergs and  dying species are reserved for the back page because readers would rather read about Tom Cruise's new kid instead of overpopulation or pollution.  People in general show very little foresight and I doubt that many have any concern about the future of our planet, depsite the fact that for the moment humanity has nowhere else to go.  It has been proven that the US has deliverately suppressed reporting on global warming, which says to me that even our government is more interested in driving their SUVs today than in building a habitable planet for our children tomorrow.

Probably because you are a teen in the midst of puberty and all those new hormones running wild in you are trying their best to embarass you.  But since everyone already kows what a penis is, what it does and what they look like, no need to be embarassed whether it is limp or ercct; it is just part of being a male human. And yes, erections are perfectly normal and only those teens who don't get them often need worry.

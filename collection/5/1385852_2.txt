PCOS is caused by when none of the ova in your ovum (eggs in your ovary) become dominate and therefore none are released.  . . Since none are released you don't have your period and your uterine lining builds up heightening your chance of uterine cancer.. . PCOS can also cause diabetes and infertility.  . . Birth control regulates your period to get rid of the uterine lining and lowers the chance for uterine cancer.. . Diet and exercise can work really well and if you lose about 10% of your weight, you might not need to use fertility drugs later on.

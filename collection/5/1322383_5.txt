well, first you can drop the bullsh**. all the bullsh** you've ever aquired through your life. than you can set an agenda. Things like social change, making things better for people etc. If you don't have this on your agenda then you're just going to  become one of the corrupted politicians we see so many times on TV, ocasionally doing good things, but only because it benefits them in other ways. read some voltaire or greek philosophers to get a view of what you should act like when you become a statesman.. . second, you must join a political party, do your internship there, prove valuable to them and that you have the right stuff to go higher up the ladder.. . you then have to persuade them to vote you, to let you run as a candidate for an office (be it mayor, counselor, senator, president etc.). this is where all the ideals and good stuff from 1 start to break down. you gotta compromise, you have to bend to the will of X and Y, so that you'll stand a chance.. . it's actually a paradox. to do good on a large scale as a politician, you must first do evil in order to stand a chance for election.. . after you've convinced your peers you can win, you actually have to get elected in your desired function. and thats another story alltogether. most people are uninformed and don't know what would be good for them in general (think of all the people complaining about outsourcing, not realising that it can work both ways, and that other companies are outsoursing into their country as well), so you have to bend to their will again.. . it's overall a dirty and messy thing to do, given the current cirucumstances, and if you don't have the moral integrity and strongness of character, you really shoudn't try out for it. there are better ways to help people,

i have my own personal opinion on this question which i always thought was right on the money.  when you drink alcohol and do something that would cause you to encounter the police, they measure the amount of alcohol in your blood stream with a breathalyzer.  this measures the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream at that moment and is accepted by the courts as evidence.  when you smoke marajuana there is no "breathalyzer" that can measure the amount of altering chemicals in your body as well as no legal standard for a limit.  the closest measurement is analyzing a persons hair to estimate the last time they ingested marajuana which is much less accurate. I think that if there were a "breathalyzer" type machine in the US than marajuana could be legalized.

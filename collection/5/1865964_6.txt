This is a chemistry answer, but it's the best I can do.  . . All cooking oils contain carbon and hydrogen atoms.  Fully hydrogenated, or saturated, oils have two hydrogen atoms for one carbon atom, H-C-H. or CH2, as a repeating unit.  Unsaturated oils have some double bonds between the carbons, which results in fewer hydrogen atoms per carbon atom.  . . The non-chemistry answer:  saturated fats or oils are worse for humans that unsaturated or partially unsaturated fats or oils.  The difference being that saturated fats and oils cause a greater elevation of blood cholesterol in susceptible individuals.

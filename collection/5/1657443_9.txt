real answer: originally it was a pagan holiday that was used to represent rebirth because of spring. Christians couldnt really remember when Christ died, so they picked the same time period so them and the pagans could all celebrate together. Bunnies and chocolate are from the commercialization of this.. . my fav answer: there is a great book called "Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Friend" which describes Jesus being very sad and stroking a bunny and tells his friend whenever bad stuff happens to him, he wants a bunny around and comfort food lol

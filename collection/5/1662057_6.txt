maybe u need to take a look at yourself because I go to college, have a boyfriend, and have money to take care of me and my child and do some shopping. Almost anyone can go to college. Maybe your so busy being lazy and negative that it's the reason you don't have a boyfriend. I'm not saying that we don't get discriminated upon but dont give them any more reason to do it by falling into the stereotype

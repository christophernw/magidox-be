It's just their rules. It's how they do things. They think that a priest, when in confessional, IS Jesus (or is in communion with Jesus), so he has the power to forgive you of your sins for Jesus (or AS Jesus). Then they give you a "penance" (like 10 Hail Mary's) so that you can "atone" for your sins and show your repentance.

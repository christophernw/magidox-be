Viral infections are caused by viruses. Because they aren't technically living a viral infection is harder to treat and harder to actually catch - think AIDS which needs straight methods of transmission.  Where as a bacterial infection moves very fast and can do damage quickly because they are living creatures and are way easier to catch. But they are also usually easier to treat because you can actually kill them - think syphilis which can be treated and destroyed by penicillin.

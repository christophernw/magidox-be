First, asian people usually work their butt off.  Hard working ethic pays off, but not enough.. . Second, they may not be rich as you think.  From experience, some just pretent to be rich by buying expensive stuff & showing off.  In reality, they may be in big debt.  See how long their luxury possessions last.  Asian people are keeping up better with the "Jones" family.

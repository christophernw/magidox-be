To speak, english is very easy, now if you're trying the learn how to write, it takes a little longer,as english is not written as it sounds, so many words sound the same ,but meanings and spelling are not...ie. bear. bare, deer, dear and many more.English is my second language, I was speaking the language within 2 months of arriving from Brasil but reading and writing took a little bit longer. Not much though.Hope this helps you.

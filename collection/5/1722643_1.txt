well obviously it all depends on what specifically you are talking about, but many things or situations we deal with today did not exist in bible times.  but that does not mean that god has stopped existing, or that he can't be here with us now guiding us, in prayer or revelation.  th ebible is a guideline, but there are many other things that were not mentioned there that nonetheless help us be better people and lead better lives.  the teachings of the bible are often or mostly to be taken figuratively and applied appropriately to today's life and situations.

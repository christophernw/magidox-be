The Milenia was not a big seller for Mazda. Personally, I think they should have kept making RX7's but those rotary engines were a too much of a pain once they had issues and well I guess they get rid of certain models to try something new.. . Commonsince76:    I know an RX7 is a different class vehicle, my point was that it was their #1 selling vehicle for a very long time, then boom certain issued caused sales to go down with that model, so they dropped it and replaced it with the RX-8. Basically if it's not selling anymore, it's out with old and in with something new to stay in competition with other companies. In turn, that's exactly what happen with the Milenia.

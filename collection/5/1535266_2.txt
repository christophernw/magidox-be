I take my dog outside  to explore the yard,letting him search for whatever interest him.Then I will hide from him so he has to search for me,takes time but gotten to the point that we go to the state gamelands now to play search. It is good exercise for the both of us to walk for hours  and never boring.Just an idea for you.

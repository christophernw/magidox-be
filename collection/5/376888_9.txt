Well, if in fact your car was vomitted in, rather than simply smelling like vomit, I would want to know the location of the incident in the vehicle.  If it was primarily in the seats, then what material are your seats?  If they are leather, you are going to need a good scented auto leather cleaner like Touch of Gold.  If the seats are cloth and/or the vomit ended up on the floor, then you will definitely need a heavy duty cleaner and disinfectant.  Lysol will certainly do the trick.  The key is to use as little water as possible, so that you aren't simply spreading it around.  Let it dry completely between cleanings... you should repeat 3 times.  The smell will probably still be there, so it will be a good idea to use carpet fresh just as you would the floors in your home.  Then top it all off with your favorite scent of car air freshener.... I recommend a Car Jar in the Macintosh scent.  you should probably leave your windows cracked during this process so all those smells have a chance to dissipate.. . I wouldn't use some of the harsh chemicals that other people are suggesting, simply because you may end up bleaching/fading/damaging your interior.  Everything I have told you is tried and true.

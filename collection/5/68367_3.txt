Racism is on the rise in certain area's of the UK because we have a weak gov't who are letting immigrants walk all over us and we cant do a thing about it.  In the area where I live many amenities for the white culture are being closed down due to lack of funding while help centres for immigrants are opening up with massive funding from the gov't.  Our schools are over crowded, there are no jobs, the NHS is being bled dry, the benefits system is being bled dry at the cost to our pensioners who deserve better - need I go on ???? No bloody wonder we're getting a little racist here dont you think ??? xxxx

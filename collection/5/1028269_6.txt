Dreams occur in your brain, so you see real things, so those your brain (not all the time though). Your brain can store what you see when you are awake and just replay them, or even distort them (and there are many other ways your brain can interpret the infomation you recieved everyday).. . In the same notion, it can become real because while you don't know,  the unconscious part of your brain is trying to solve problems that you have and figure how to do this and that. Then it might show you how to solve the problem as a dream. It's something along those lines. . So the elevator you take to your office, your brain knows it too and it may occur in your dreams, which may be a phenomenon to you that you dreamt something you didn't actually see, your brain is really a sponge that absorbs everything and sometimes can spit out scenarios or solution to you in dreams that may seem like it's predicting the future.. . Or I can be wrong and the brain does have the power to predict the future, but that hasn't been proved yet.

Human behavior reacts in many different ways when confronted with questions, some relate facts that we have heard thru out our lives others have scientific knowledge of the questions. They may appear trivial to you but to others it connects on basic levels with personality, environment and learning experience.  What is wonderful about free choice, you have the choice to ignore the "trivial" questions in which your are referring and answer questions that relate directly to you.

You got the Jimmy legs/arms! (Seinfeld joke). .  Stress is one of the most common causes of sleeping disorders. Also, try listening to relaxing music while you're sleeping, I know when I don't, I start thinking about things and my mind races soo much I can't sleep well. Try doing soemthing tiring before sleeping.

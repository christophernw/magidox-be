I know nothing about dropping hair, lymphatic cancer, or ptimal epilipsy but I do have Lupus.. Lupus is basically an overactive immune system that attacks health parts of the body. It is a serious disease but not always a deadly disease.  People with Lupus can live a decent life that is not necessarily shortened due to the disease. Hope this helps :-)

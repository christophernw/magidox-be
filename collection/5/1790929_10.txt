eye for an eye was a limitation.. . i don't think Jesus changed anything.  he gave understanding to the law.  for example if you want to have sex with somone and you don't get the chance is God going to be pleased with you because you never did it or will he be mad that you would have had you had the chance.  that is why whoever commits lust in his heart is already guilty of adultry.. . Mat 5:38 Â¶ Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: . Mat 5:39  But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. . . read carefully.  he is not changing anything.  he is just adding understanding that we are not to justify vengance using God's law.  but aren't we still justified in an eye for an eye.

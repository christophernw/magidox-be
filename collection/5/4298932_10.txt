Jury duty is one of the costs of living in a free society. The reasons for being excused from jury duty are extablished by state law, and most states have tightened up those laws so it is more difficult to get excused that it used to be. Still, if you really CAN’T serve, tell the truth. Most lawyers won’t want you on the case if you can’t concentrate on the case because you’re going to be so worried about how you’ll pay the bills without your paycheck.. Someone here said jury pools are drawn from voter registration lists. Most states plugged that loophole, because some people were canceling their voter registration as soon as the election was over and only re-registering when the next election comes around. Thus, the states started to supplement their list by using a number of other lists, such as driver's licenses and even your phone or utility accounts.

It was what the slave owners did, they raped black women to produce more slaves so they call them black that way they can make more money. They also did it because they didn't want white people to have any black blood. Last and lest was to make the slaves light skin so that the light skin slaves can oppress the dark ones and so on.. . Mixed people should take on the nationality of the father and Being black is not a nationality or being African.

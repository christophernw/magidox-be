to a 'T' - exactly (fits to a T, done to a T, suits you to a T, etc) - : Firstly it's a shortening of the expression 'to a tittle' which is an old English word for tiny amount, like jot. Secondly, it is a reference to something fitting as if measured with a T-square, the instrument used by carpenters, mechanics and draughtsmen to measure right-angles.

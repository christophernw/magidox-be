Well I'm not so sure about cats, but I had those symptoms for three weeks before it dawned on my doctor that I had a simple sinus infection.  It was making my lymph nodes swell, and then I'd fight it off a bit, and then it'd happen again.  That could be what's going on, it seems logical, but I just don't know.. . I'd go back to the vet, or try another vet, perhaps on recommendation from your local cat rescue group or something.

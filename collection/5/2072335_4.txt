The biggest part of the problem these days has nothing to do with religion but politics and money. Think about it...if the US decided to go to war with Italy instead of Afghanistan and Iraq, we would have Catholic terrorists on our hands. It just so happens that the people we are warring with are Muslims. And so of course in return, anyone fighting for their own cause without military status is labelled a rebel or terrorist.. It also has alot to do with the media. Our media is in a major war of its own to see who can publish the most, the fastest, and in return, get the most ratings. So, what to publish? Why, what everyone wants to hear of course! Nobody wants to hear about Muslims and Arabs doing good for society, they would rather hear all the dirt and mush cuz that's what we thrive on these days.. The day that we show our independence of the media is the day that it finally gives in and cries to give us the reality of things, instead of their hollywood tales.

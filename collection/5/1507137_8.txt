Wow! Have you been under a rock or something?!?!? Girls are everywhere in gaming now. You really can't turn on one show that has anything to do with gaming and not see one. I am a girl and I love to play Grand Theft Auto and Metal Gear Solid and all of those kinds of games. Just cause you don't see a ton of girls in the game stores doesn't really mean anything. I just means they probably went into Claire's first. . . . . Which I could never do. Video games is first in my book!

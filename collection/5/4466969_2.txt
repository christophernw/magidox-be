There are three types of Occupation in the Military.  Combat Arms, Combat Support, and Combat Service Support.. . Combat Arms are the actual trigger pullers.  These include Infantry, Cavalry, Armor, Field Artillery, Aviation,...  Combat Support are the force multipliers.  Communications, Intelligence, Engineers, Military Police...  Combat Service Support is the group of occupations that keep everyone working.  Food Service, Maintenace, Finance, JAG, Adjutant General (administration).... . The services performed by contractors are generally limited to this third group.  Even then not all these are contracted out (such as Finance and Legal) but they are not contracted exclusively.  Military and civilian personnel work side by side in Food Service and Maintenace, the two largest groups.  Some functions of Engineers are contracted.  Also some equipment is either very new or very complicated and so civilians who are experts may be contracted to train, repair and consult.. . Some of us joke that in the future an Inafnatry Battalion will consist of 300 civilian contractors and 1 platoon of actual Infantrymen who's primary function will be to keep the contractors safe.

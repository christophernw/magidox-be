The evidence is really overwhelming which is why it seems incredible to see creationists so glibly dismiss it. Only as a result of ignorance or sheer bigotry will anyone reject the idea of biological evolution-it is as proven as anything in science ever can be. Also creationists can't get away with conceding that animals adapt to their environment because that is evolution-it is only defined as genetic change in any given species over time. Eons of micro-evolution in any species amounts to macro-evolution.

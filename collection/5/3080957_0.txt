Read your pet. After this long you should know your pet.. Has he or she just laid down to wait to die, or are they in such pain it is inhumane to keep them alive.. Is it sad, depressed.. Or does it give life all it's got with joyful eyes.. Can you see the spirit of life still in it.. It is your job to know your dog and to decide wich would be better.To live, or to die?

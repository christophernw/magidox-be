if you move the magnetic source through a coil you can measure how much current you get on both end of the wire with a meter. when the magnet is moved throught the coil the it magnet has a negative or positive attraction or opposing force that will push current through.  It will create an inductive force through making current and if there is a capacitor the store that current the capacitor can be used as a power source.

The Catholic Church does not try to hide the Da Vinci Code. I goto an all-boys catholic school, and I'm reading the book right now. No one really cares. What the Catholic Church is against is the fact that people start to believe that the Da Vinci Code is real. It has nothing to do with reading the book. It doesn't matter as long as you read the book purely for fiction. Hope that helps.

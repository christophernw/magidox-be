Lol....paintings of the rennasance era, about 500 to 1000 years after the NT was compiled,NOT based on any historical reference or witness but rather on artist inclination. but the question is a good one.  AT BEST,  if the Jesus character were historically real, and there is more than adequate reason to question that historicity,  then he would have been SHemite..that is, majority, at that time Jewish people were dark skinned, dark haired....the only Israelites that would have been of white or fair complexion, blond hair would have been converts to Judaism.

You've asked a fair question, so I hope you'll accept my answer as a sincere one.. . One thing to say is that "simple" is often relative. Sure, there are probably people who would gladly type all of the questions in their homework into Y! Answers if they thought people would do them. And there are people who value points enough that they would answer them. But in my experience, if someone doesn't know how to do a problem, then explaining how to do it still might not do much good.. . One of the strategies involved in helping people to become better problem-solvers is to model or demonstrate correct behaviors.. . If you look back at a number of the answers that I provide, I try to go through the process step-by-step in providing a worked solution. My hope is that people can use my solution as a model for doing other problems on their own. Even though some people might just want others to do their homework, I have to be something of an optimist and hope that other people will simply take a worked solution and then try to do other problems like it on their own.. . I'd be willing to guess that other people who follow the same approach that I do also have the same hope for how their work is used.. . I'm interested in seeing what other people think. Great question!

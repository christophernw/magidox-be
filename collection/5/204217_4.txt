You have to always remember that ideas don't exist in a vacuum.  They are logically dependent on other ideas, in a hierarchical fashion.  . . For example, I could not explain what an "orphan" was to you if you didn't already understand the meaning of "parent.". . Similarly, asking the question "what caused the universe?" ignores the context.  The universe is the background for which explanations and causes are possible.  We observe cause and effect WITHIN the universe, but it does not mean that the universe as a whole must have preceeding cause.  That's extending something you observe to someplace where it might not apply.. . I'm not saying the universe is uncaused (I don't think science really knows yet), but if it were uncaused, I would be ok with that.  A lot of people have trouble with accepting an uncaused universe, "because something so complex cannot be uncaused," but then go on to accept an uncaused god, who by definition must be more complex than the universe he created...?  It seems hypocritical to me.. . The other common argument is "anything that begins to exist has a cause," but this is blatant question-begging, and follows in the same traditional "god of the gaps" style..  . The final tidbit that is of interest is the fact that time is not independent of space.  We know that from many experiments with clocks on satellites and observations in astronomy.  So it's very possible that time BEGAN with the universe.  Therefore, asking "what came before the universe?" is like asking "what's north of the north pole?"  It could be an invalid question, because there is no "before" to speak of.. . Bottom line - we don't know for sure yet all the details of the universe's beginning (if it even had one?).  But saying "God did it" doesn't actually make us know, it's just a more egotistical way of saying "I don't know."

Without looking up the answer as most do online before they answer, I'll tell you what I've learned.  Learned... interesting way to start out.  Knowledge is LEARNED.  Intelligence, or acumen, is our ABILITY to learn.  In other words, let's use an analogy like eating.  Knowledge/Learning is food, and intelligence/ability is your stomach.  Knowledge:Food as Intelligence:Stomach. . Kind of one of those things you'd see on an IQ test... . One thing is equal to, or the same as...   How much you can learn depends merely on your appetite or how much food you can eat.  Knowledge is the food of the soul they say, but w/o the proper intelligence to understand/CONSUME (stomach size), then all the information/data/schooling in the world won't matter or make a difference really if you don't have the adequate potential.. . So, knowledge is everything in the world, all the information that is.  Intelligence is your ability to absorb it and understand it.

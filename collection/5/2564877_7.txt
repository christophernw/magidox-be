Gold is a precious metal whose "rarity and its physical properties have made it one of the most prized of Earth's natural resources."  It has high malleability, high ductility, and a tradition of being a standard upon which currencies are based, or a good way of saving and exchanging wealth.  . . I still remember how Vietnamese women smuggled gold leaf sewn into the linings of their clothes, thus enabling them to have something to bank on when they got away from the Communists.. . I remember reading how the Nazis forcibly removed Jews' teeth, and scavenged among the corpses of Jews to get the gold from their teeth at the death camps.

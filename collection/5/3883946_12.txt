I have no basis for this answer and may be totally off, but here is my shot at it: the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil came from Satan. Because Satan existed, that had to be there. It's kind of like there would be no reason to have any Savior if Satan wasn't here. So, God wanted us to live forever, but the reality is that evil did exist and always has existed. It wasn't there because God wanted us to die or wanted us to invite sin into our lives; it was just a reality of this world. Now it is up to us to choose to follow God and abandon evil.

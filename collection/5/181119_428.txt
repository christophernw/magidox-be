I work with the disabled. These folks love working at the local theme parks...especially near the whales, dolphins and the water rides! Working at a water theme park is the tops in summer employment. Many of these places also offer free admission for employees and their families. When my people come home from work, they are beaming! There is nothing like working with Shamu or being able to get wet on a hot summer's day...and being paid for it!

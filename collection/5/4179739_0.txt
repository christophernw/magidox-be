Everyone learns in different ways. I just finished a class (PADI scuba instructor coarse) in which we learned that some people learn better using images to relate to, some by reading, some learn better with "hands on" techniques, some through multi-media (interactive computer programs),.... . There isn't a "better way" to learn other than learning in the best way that works for you or the best way that works for your individual students.. . It boils down to getting to know each student and finding the best way for that student to learn.

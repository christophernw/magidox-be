A Congressional caucus is a group of members of the United States Congress which meets to pursue common legislative objectives. Formally, caucuses are organized as Congressional Member organizations, governed under the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives. They aren't always called, "caucus"â€” there are also "Coalitions", "Study Groups", "Task Forces", and "Working Groups.". . One prominent example of a congressional caucus is the Congressional Black Caucus, a group of African-American members of Congress. In early United States History, the Congressional nominating caucus and Congressional legislative caucus were influential meetings of congressmen to decide the party's nominiee for President and legislative policy. Similar caucuses were held by the parties at state level.

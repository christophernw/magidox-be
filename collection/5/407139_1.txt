depends on the curse, and from what religion it originated.  but i would suggest looking up info in wicca text books or finding yourself a shaman (they still exist, my sister in-law's grandfather is the shaman/medicine man for the navajo indian tribe in arizona, he doesn't even speak english and he's lived in america all his life.. . but the best way would be to find semptoms, and look them up, then try to determine which curse it was (or if it's even a curse) and then it will be easier to find the means to remove it (there really isn't many cases of reversing the curse, so ur best bet is to remove it before it does too much harm)

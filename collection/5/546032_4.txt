I just found the only thing that has ever worked for me with cold sores. I've had some really bad ones. At a doctor visit for something else, the doctor prescribed something that could stop a cold sore right at the start, but you have to take it the minute you feel the tingling. It is called acyclovir, and it's working great. It stops it before it starts. My husband tried it too, and it worked for him also.

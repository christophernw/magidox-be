The worst thing that ever happened to me from lack of sleep (3 days without sleeping) was that I blacked out. There's a good chunk of time that I was awake and doing things, but I honestly don't remember any of it.. . The very, very worst that could happen, I would think, would be if you were driving and fell asleep at the wheel. That happened to a woman I know and she spent a few months in a body cast after she crashed.

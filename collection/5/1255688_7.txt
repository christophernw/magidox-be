i do not care what the rest of the world thinks. one when we were looking for support against Iraq nations like France and Germany were against . then you come to find out that Saddam was giving them money in the oil for food scam. 2 when these countries need something they coming running to the US for help. and we are foolish enough to help. maybe the world will hate us enough that we will turn to isolationists. which would probable be the best for the country.

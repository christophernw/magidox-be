i wouldn't experiment with pills and all. It depends on how long you havent been sleeping. there are sleeping disorders.. such as insomnia.. could be dangerous so get to the doctor asap. otherwise if it hasnt gone on long.. it could be stress.. to much on the mind... try to maybe write in a diary or something.. get everything out that your thinking about before you try to go to sleep. dont drink caffeine before bed either... including soda. Also dont eat anything with sugar in it either it can keep you up. if it persists do get to the doctor though.

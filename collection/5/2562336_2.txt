It's possible that you may have some sort of fungul infection on your foot.  If so then you should go to a doctor.  If its just a bad smell, then you should try where shoes that have more circulation so that ur feet can breathe.  Or simply try putting a little baby poweder in your shoes, this absorbs the sweat and acts as a deodorant.

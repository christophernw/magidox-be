God reaches and works on us where we are at. If your parents profess Jesus Christ and the light of Christ is working in their lives then who are you to judge whether or not they are saved? . . What might be more important (now that all of you are saved) is that you work on your relationships. Set boundaries and accept the things you cannot change, and reconcile with the things that are for God alone.. . Continue to pray to God to open up your spirit to a humble love while you enjoy the enthusiasm of your first love. Pray for your parents and let God touch them with His Holy Spirit. Use the same Holy Spirit to love your parents unconditionally. Forgive past hurts and wrongs, and look for a reconciliation spirit of peace.

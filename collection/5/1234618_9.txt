Having graduated with an English degree in Literature I can tell you the most boring "literature" is Victorian. A bunch of rich people laying around trying to figure out who they are or where they are going. It's mostly rich people with nothing better to do than sit around and worry.. . When you are busy with life (work, school, kids, hobbies) you don't have time to lay around and sulk! Have you ever felt depressed when you were extremely busy?

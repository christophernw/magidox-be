oh gee! all kinds of classes. freshman: english, science, speech. you will be taking all kinds of science classes all four years. you will have clinical experience, pharmaceutical classes, nutrition classes. i would also suggest going to the website of the college that you are interested in and find out the specifics there. every school is different. Good luck in your studies! Nursing is a very hard major.

OK hon .. our bodies are way smarter than we think.. i m no doctor or anything but this is what i know.. our bodies start to store more fat when its intake is less.. in the worry that  there might be lesser intake of fats in the future. I am 33 years old mom of 2 .. i weigh 120 lbs.. never diet seriously.. i just hate sweets... so take 2% milk please ..so your body doesnt get all psycho!!!!! OK // another weight lose remedy,, first thing in the morning.. hot tea.. no sugar with lemon .. as much lemon as u can take without getting a sore throat.. this will cleanse your skin too and you will definately lose weight.. remmember luke warm tea not ice tea and pls no sugar !!!! . . good luck

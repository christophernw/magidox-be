Good for you!  Keep your strength and resolution.  To that end...Get a restraining order and make him stay away from you.  . . If you really want to let him know how you feel, then write him a letter.  (Don't put anything in it that could get you in trouble.)  If you write him a letter, then you will not have to go thru the emotional thing with him.

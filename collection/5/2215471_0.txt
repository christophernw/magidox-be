Radiology if the measurement of the radioactivity of a select element (like an isotope).. . Because radioactivity is a property of atoms, radiology is a study of atomic behavior (the changes that take place in an atom).. . Chemistry is the study of the atomic properties of elements, and the measurement of their changes when you do something to them.. . Therefore, in both radiology and chemistry, you are studying and measuring the atomic behavior of an element.

It appears most eye twiches are harmless, involuntary spasms of the tiny muscles surrounding the eye. Some causes are fatigue, squinting a lot, consuming too much caffeine, or working in a less than ideal visual environment, staring at a computer screen for long periods of time. Just like a muscle spasm at any other part of the body, an eye twitch can mean you've taxed your muscles and need to relax them. . . At home treatments that may help include hot baths, warm or cold compresses, rinsing your eyes out with warm water, or administrating eye drops. . . However persistent, more violent eye twitches could be a symptom of other physical or psychological ailments, such as undue stress or temper tantrums, neurological damage, or even epilepsy.

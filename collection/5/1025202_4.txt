I am agnostic.  I disagree with your theory that agnostics "don't want to believe in God so you don't have to be accountable, but won't rule out the existance just in case you're wrong and you don't want to go to hell?". . Personally speaking, honey, my Conscience holds me accountable for every mean word I say to others.  My Conscience holds me accountable for each bird I flip to other drivers.  My Conscience screams at me if I shirk from my responsibilities.  My Consience is based on the ethics that my parents taught me, that the law of the land requires I adhere to to be a good citizen, plus ethics I have learned from various different religions and philosophies of the world.. . Being agnostic OR atheist does not mean we run from our responsibilities.  Most of us DO live highly ethical lives as according to what we stand for (treating others compassionately, helping others when needed, taking responsibility when required).  We hold ourselves accountable. . . Personally speaking for myself, I am agnostic simply because Religion has yet to prove that 'god' exists AND science has yet to disprove 'god'.  Simple as that, honey.  My ethical life has NOTHING to do with the "god" issue.. . I am providing a link for you to learn more about agnosticism if you wish to learn more.  If not, no biggie.

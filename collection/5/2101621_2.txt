never use yeast, it gives you a hang-over from hell. for grape wine use 4 gals. of squeezed grapes to 1 gal of water. add 1/2 bag of sugar cover with cheese cloth.stir daily,after 4 days add the other half of sugar. after 7 days drain and squeeze grapes. let sit for 2 days and strain or siphon wine out of container, this reduces sediment. add i cup of volka to mix and let wine ferment for a month or so.

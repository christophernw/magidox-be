Chemically combined means that the two substances have reacted together to give a new substance, as opposed to just mixing.  Like, if you mixed hydrogen and oxygen together without a reaction, you'd still have hydrogen gas and oxygen gas.  But if they react together, they're chemically combined to give water.. . This really should have been in chemistry rather than mathematics.

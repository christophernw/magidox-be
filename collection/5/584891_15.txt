Ah, the Kennedy assassination of the Harry Potter world:. but this time we know who done it, just why.. . it brought tears to my eyes reading it, and i reread it again just to make sure i wasn't hallucinating. Snape has an equal amount of hatred and loyalty-just to who is the question. The man is complex as hell, with a seriously damn good reason for what he does. We may not receive our answer in book 7, it may take much longer to find the true reason.

As with what the sensible people above said. The Twin Towers were supported by a central column of steel with struts going outwards, rather than an external 'jacket' of steel round the outer walls like many other high structures. So as the weight of the building above crashed down, the force would have been highly concentrated around the central column which then collapsed. If the buildings had had an external 'jacket' then perhaps the bottom half would have survived as the weight would have been more dissipated, but who knows? These buildings were designed to support their own  weight and accomodate wind and other forces, but were not built to withstand a large impact force from above - why would they be?

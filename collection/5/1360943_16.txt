Many conservatives believe that the Earth goes through natural cycles of warming and cooling.  We may have a small influence on that, but the cycles are going to occur regardless, they just may happen more frequently.  Until science can prove we are the majority cause of global warming, Many concervatives are going to feel that lower productivity and higher cost of living is too high a price to pay for something that is going to occur naturally anyway.  BTW, science has proved that the planets has gone through many cycles of warming and cooling dating back to before man even existed.

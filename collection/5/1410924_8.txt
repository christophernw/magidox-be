There is no single meaning.  Many people think that this means there are infinite meanings or as many meanings as there are people or some such codswallop.  In fact there are exactly 42 different meanings -- a number made famous by the British comedy author Douglas Adams in "The HItchiker's Guide to The Galaxy". Mr. Adams, of course, managed to avoid listing the 42 different meanings, and made great fun by implying that the actual meaning was 42 itself. lol!

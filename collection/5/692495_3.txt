Blood in your urine could signal a problem with your kidneys.  A stone, urinary tract infection, or some other kind of problem.  If you can actually see the blood in your urine that's not a good thing and you need to get a doc on the case.  Most blood in urine is microscopic and can only be seen through a blood test.  They will probably do a urinalysis, some blood work, possibly a kidney ultrasound.

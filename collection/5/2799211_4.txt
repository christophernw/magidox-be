You need to define "easily," but I assume you mean breaking your foot from a minor trauma. Two main causes - too much pressure or very brittle bone. Being very overweight will put a lot of pressure on your feet. You can have significant injury from seemingly minor trauma if you have are obese. Having osteoporosis or other rare conditions of the bone can also cause easy fractures (breaks).

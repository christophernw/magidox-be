I don't know what this is, but I can guess, some kind of  a belt that just by wearing it, will thin your waistline?  Or does it vibrate the fat away?  These things have come and gone, it sounds like yet another gimmick.  If you need to lose weight in your waistline, exercising, some kind of walking, dancing, kickboxing, things like this will trim you, also watching what you eat.

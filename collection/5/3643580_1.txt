The first question is ask is why you feel the need to be defensive when interacting with others. To be assertive, you need to say what you mean- exactly what you mean- without adding emotion. In other words, if someone were to say "why did you do this thing" you might become defensive if you take the question as a threat to your judgement, but you would be able to answer assertively if you say "I did it because at the time, I felt it was the best course of action".  Most people who are assertive are able to listen to the words with their ears, not with their emotions. Someone told me once that they really wanted to discuss a problem with their friend, but they couldn't because the friend had told them that to do this thing would be a bad idea and yet she did it anyway, and that's what caused this problem. She said she just knew the friend would say "I told you so", and my question was- she did tell you so, and you made a decision to do it anyway, so simply say- yes, and I wish I had listened to you but I made this decision. Can we talk? When she did that, she and her friend were able to discuss the matter rationally. Hope this helps.

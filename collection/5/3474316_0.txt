UPN (which originally stood for the United Paramount Network) is a television network in the United States, owned by CBS Corporation, which also owns the more widespread CBS network. Because of this dual corporate ownership, in several large American cities, the local CBS and UPN stations are operated as "duopolies.". . On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Warner Bros. Entertainment announced plans to launch the CW Network in the fall of 2006. This new joint venture network will feature programming from both The WB and UPN. CBS chairman Les Moonves and Warner Bros. Entertainment CEO Barry Meyer announced that both The WB and UPN will cease independent operations as of September 4, 2006

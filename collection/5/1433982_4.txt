People generally don't become intolerant at the mere mention of Jesus.  People become angry and defensive when the name of Jesus is shouted from all and sundry when it need not be.  If I'm having a conversation with someone and we're talking about our faith, there is no reason for someone else to horn in and start praising Jesus.  It happens though.  Total strangers have actually done that in public to a group of us on several occasions.  In certain contexts, it's fine.  If the question is "What do you believe" then praise Jesus all you wish. If the question is "How does one follow the 8 Fold Path", there's no call for it.  . . When a political figure claims that Jesus told him to attack another country or that Jesus is on our side and that's all there is to it, people get upset and a bit angry.  Look at it this way, if a guy opens fire at the local adult bookstore and says that Jesus told him to, we lock him up in a nice little padded room because we think he's not sane and we're more than a little afraid of what he may do next.  When our "leader" says it, we should be no less afraid.  As much as some people love to make it a black and white, us against them issue, it isn't.  There are many shades of gray. I could write all day and not ever scratch the surface of all of them.

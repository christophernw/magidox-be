Well I love the books and i only like the movies. I just got into harry potter this past summer and i am an adult who had previously thought harry was for kids. but i liked it. The books are great they develop detail until you almost believe the characters are real. and the movies are OK but they leave out some of the important bits from the books or they change things around and make it different from the books. so no in a way i don't think they do complete justice to the books however they do make the books come to life and they are enjoyable. but i still enjoy reading the books more. and i can't wait for the 7th book to come out!!

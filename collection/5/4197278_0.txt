About 8 years ago I worked in a fish packaging plant and it was so wrong in so many ways, I almost threw up a lot, the conveyor belt made me sick to my stomach, I had to quit after only one week.. Digging my fox hole and staying in it over night was pretty dirty.. Working in a senior center, I am not even going to go into details but that was a DIRTY job.

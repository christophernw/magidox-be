Eat a lot of protein and do some aerobic excercise. Eating stuff like peanut butter is a great way to gain weight, but make sure that you excercis (at least 30 min a day) or you'll get fat. You probably have a high metabolism, so you might not even have to work out. Just make sure the weight you gain is healthy and not from junk food, becuase the junk food fat is really hard to lose.

You may have to resort to common law, regardless of any lease you may have signed. E.G. when you rent, you are obliged to allow reasonable access to the landlord or his agent, but that shouldn't be more than once every three months at most. During these visits its the landlords DUTY to inspect for damage, so if anything is broken, like a hinge, it's his fault, not yours.. They are NOT allowed to enter the property without your permission - what if you're in the bath/in bed with the milkman/doing a self-portrait of yourself in the nude?. You have the right to privacy.. If a tenancy is coming to an end (legitamately, by mutual agreement) it can be a difficult time, but your rights do not change. You can compromise, but don't you just hate the fact that you can't leave your underwear on the bathroom floor when you're in a hurry or dirty dishes in the kitchen sink?. Teach this guy some choice phrases in Anglo Saxon that end in the word "off".

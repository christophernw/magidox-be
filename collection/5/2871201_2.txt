Because Americans don't like it.  The system we use now works just fine for most, so why learn the metric system?  That's probably rather provincial of us.  BTW I am an engineer and use the metric system every day in my work.  The metric system is much better for doing my work (decimals rather than fractions, everything in nice round units, etc.), but I prefer the English system in my day-to-day life.  I think the units tend to be much more handy, like a foot is much more useful than a meter.

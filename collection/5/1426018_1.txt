ON a flat sheet, laid ON a pillow top, that's ON top of a queen size mattress, laid ON top of a box spring, resting ON a frame that's resting ON a headboard and foot board, ON top of carpeting, that's ON top of padding, ON top of a sub-floor, resting ON top of beams, supported ON a foundation, ON top of terra firma.  Oh, and the bed is pretty soft and comfy, too.

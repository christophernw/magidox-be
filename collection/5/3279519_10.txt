i had depression last year and i'm finally feeling better a year later. what worked for me:. -spending time with good friends who accepted me with where i was at, sadness, anger, fatigue, indifference and everything.. -working on "self-care", ie. things that reminded me that i'm important. simple things like flossing, taking care of myself, saying no, putting myself first.. -counselling with a therapist or group sessions. -taking personal development courses. -allowing myself to rest since i was tired all the time. -as every doctor says: exercise, drink lots of water, eat well and rest. this really did help, evne though i only started this 2 months ago. it's made a huge difference in my energy levels. -learning skills to assist me in my personal relationships. how to say what i want, how to eliminate guilt, figuring out what i believe and why. i think that was the biggest thing that led to my depression was feeling stuck. like i felt i couldn't be honest with people. once i learned that, my friendships got better and the emotional stress lessened.. -find opportunities to laugh and get the good brain chemicals moving again. find a new job if that's what's dragging you down. . -eliminate as much baggage as possible. -forgive. heal.move on. think positive. give yourself time.. -look up websites on depression for healthy ideas.

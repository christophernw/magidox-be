the letter E was once used to represent the grade 0......so if u got a 1 you passed just with a low score...eventually it was thought that it was too easy and kids werent getting an education....so they increased it to 55 and lower- failing.......then F came in to represent failing...F, failing, get it...then, they thought it was unfair for students to pass this way because they said passing with a 99 was the same as a 91.....so they made the - and +...+ were in the highs 789...- were in the lows...123

You can't. All the children in a school can't be above average, either.. . Part of your life is going to be dull and ordinary, part sad and part happy. The exact numbers vary, but 80-10-10 is reasonable for now. The very definition of happy is those special moments that are better than the rest. If you are a begger in Calcutta, happy would be a day you get many more rupees than normal, enough to share with a friend and have enough rice and vegetables to be full, for once. If you are Donald Trump, happy would be a day when you eat dinner in Paris at a 3-star restaurant and the head waiter doesn't sneer at your accent.. . If you don't have sad days and ordinary days for contrast, you won't know what happy is.

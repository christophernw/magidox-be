When you first boil the soup, the 'stock' from the meat, vegetables, or cereals that you are using will slowly get extracted and blend into the soup.. This heating process must be continued, for the stock to get adequately cooked.. ...But, if you continue to boil it, the water in the soup will start evaporating - and turn it into a thick gravy instead !. So, to avoid evaporation, the soup is made to simmer, at a much lower heat.

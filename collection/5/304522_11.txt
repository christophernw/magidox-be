I faced this problem for years. Even when you have some experience in a similar job that's often not good enough for them! Voluntary work is one way of getting experience, but it depends what kind of work you want.. Or you could write to employers and ask them how to get the experience they want and ask them why they don't want to bother training their employees anymore! They expect all the benefits from someone else doing the training.

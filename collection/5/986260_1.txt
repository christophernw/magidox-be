It is not the lord. That much I know.. . A better question in my mind is "What is life". Today I laid on the wet ground and looked up at a Eucalyptus tree that was full of Monarch Butterflies. They moved in all different directions, coming and going. I realized that the individual didn't have any meaning, but the group, the whole swirling, moving, undulating mass had something.... . And I realized further that the meaning of that big moving life was no more significant, or insignificant than the meaning of my individual life, or the whole of humanity.. . It was way cool.

When you are full of fear and guilt, the world can't be right until everyone is just as afraid and full of guilt as you are.. . That, and the questions are framed so that you have to agree with that person to answer them. There is no new knowledge to be found. The element of free thought is removed, and free speech is restricted. That sounds pretty socialist to me.

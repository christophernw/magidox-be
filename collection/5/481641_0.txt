Well, on the one hand, people who aren't getting their basic needs met are more likely to resort to crime, especially if they can't see a way out.. . On the other hand, people who have a lot of money and/or status are more likely to get away with the crimes they do commit.. . This is a serious oversimplification, but it should give you a starting point for a paper or two.

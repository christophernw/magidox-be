Eye color can and does change in some people throughout their lives. The iris of the eye (the colored part) contains melanocytes, the same cells which cause "tanning" in the skin. People with light-colored eyes have fewer melanocytes, and those with darker eyes have more, in much the same way as people with lighter or darker skin have different amounts of melanocytes. This also accounts for the fact that some people have differences in their eye color as the seasons change. Having said this, most people seem to have a relatively stable eye color throughout their lives, and this eye color is attained at a relatively young age -- usually in the preschool years.

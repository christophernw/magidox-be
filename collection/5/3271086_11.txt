Every time he tries to claw something that he is not supposed to, take him to his scratching post to make him use it instead.  Praise him vocally and by petting him while he scratches it.  [This worked for my cat.]  If he is not interested in using his scratching post, put some catnip on it.  If nothing else, get him a piece of wood and put catnip on it.  Put it with his stuff so that he knows it's his, and he should figure out that he can only claw his things.. He's a bit old to learn, but it's always worth a try.  Good luck!

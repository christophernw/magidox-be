If you were an evolutionist, how could you truly profess to be a born-again Christian?  Christians believe in the Bible as God's word, and the VERY FIRST THING mentioned in the Bible is how God created the heavens and the earth.  As Christians who realize that all scripture is true (and not only that but God-breathed-2 Timothy 3:16*), then how could we acknowledge that the theory of evolution, which was created by a guy within the past 200 years, is true?  The same Bible verse that tells how God created the earth has been around MUCH longer than that!!  So, really, if you ever meet a "Christian" who says that, somehow, by random chance, man "evolved" from some little fish way-back-when, then that person is NOT a Bible-believing Christian!. . 2 Timothy 3:16. .    All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.  . (NIV)

What part of putting your elbows on the table involves speech on your part? Do you make an announcement like "I'm going to put my elbows on the table now"? . . Yes, you are free (in the United States anyway) to express your opinion freely as am I. So stop being rude and take your elbows off the table before I knock them off.

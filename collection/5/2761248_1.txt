Wave-particle duality of light in particular is observed in a number of experiments but only one or the other form.  To show this you will to explain 2 or more phenomena, for matter the photoelectric effect is the best example for waves there are plenty to choose from.. . That however is for light, if you are talking about matter for example electrons as a wave, then you will have to use debrogle equation and explain a experiment like electron diffraction, where is acts as a probablility wave and builds up a diffraction pattern rather that each electron actually being considered as a wave.. . Hope this helps

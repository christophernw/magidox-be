If you feel hatred, the least advisable thing to do is ignore it. Deal with it. If they did something illegal, report them to the police. If what they did is not illegal, maybe you can report them to some other authorities. Or make what they did public, so other people know, and these guys are at least uncomfortable and embarrassed. I can't be more specific, because I don't know exactly what they did to you.. . At any rate, if someone hurt you and your children, it's not you who should feel unclean for hating them. That's the most natural thing. And as long as you keep feeling unclean for your feelings, they're still hurting you. Don't let them do THAT to you, too.

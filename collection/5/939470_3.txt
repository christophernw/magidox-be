hmm.... when u say deoxygenated blood... it doesnt mean 100% no oxygen. it means low level oxygen.. oxygenated blood is carried in Arteries, while Deoxygenated is in vains.. I don't really know the answer. But y dont we make a guess.. Ever thought y different blood vessels are used to carry the two different blood?. Ever thought that cells in the vains carrying deoxygenated blood may be designed to cope with the low oxygen level?. If not, y use vains, our body can just use artery to carry the deoxygenated blood too, right?!?!. if you do get the real answer... do inform me, k.... c u dude...

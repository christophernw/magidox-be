Depends on the situation and location.  If you mean while driving down a local street, try pumping the brakes, let off the gas, shift into a lower gear, use the emergency brake, use the curb to help slow down.  Last choice, find something to hit, that will be the least damaging to life and then the car.  This could include putting the car into reverse.  A destroyed transmission or car is better than losing a life.

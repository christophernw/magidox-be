James F is correct. The Christian priests, wishing to convert various groups, adopted and incorporated their practices into the religion. The egg and rabbit are from the fertility holidays with the coming of spring. The Xmas tree was also adopted from Germanic tribes who put candles on trees outside as part of their worship at the winter solstice. It has nothing to do with the birth of Jesus. As a matter of fact, Christian historians think Jesus was born in February. December 25 was the Roman Saturnalia and Christianity got its start in the Roman Empire where the pagans were used to celebrating December 25.

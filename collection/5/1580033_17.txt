you don`t have to be forgiven. you don`t have to believe in God. you don`t have to seek mercy or grace. you don`t have to change. you also don`t have to go to heaven! we all make all our own choices, God doesn`t force anyone to believe or accept him! you can choose to go to hell with a whole lot of other nice folks who just didn`t believe! but i will tell you one thing you will do, like it or not! EVERY KNEE WILL BOW AND EVERY TONGUE WILL CONFESS THAT JESUS CHRIST IS LORD!!!!!! even the demons believe and tremble! the fool says in his heart there is no God! not believing doesn`t make him not real!!

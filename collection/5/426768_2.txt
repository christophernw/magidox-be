Ok here it goes... in the old testament God set a covenant with his people in which to set them apart from other nations at the time. They were not also allowed to wear clothing with mixed materials in it, not to eat any fish without scales and fins, etc. Look at Deuteronomy Chapter 14. When Jesus arrived, the Jews had set rules sometimes referred to as the Talmud and another one I can't remeber on the spot which sort of built a wall around the other rules God had originally set for his people. It got to the point where if you spit on the ground and the spit rolled it was considered working on the Sabath (Don't qoute me on that because I'm not exactly sure if that's entirely truth but it got to that point, but you get the idea). Jewish people had to provide a sacrifice at that time to cleanse them of their sins. Generally some type of animal. So when Jesus came and died on the cross, he was the only sacrifice ever needed for everyone not just the Jews but the rest of us which the Bible refers to as the Gentiles. Jews believed and still believe that a Messiah will come and cleanse the people from their sins but they didn't believe it was Jesus even though Biblically he fulfilled every prophecy, was perfect, preached only about love, and forgiveness and not heiricy, and freely gave his life and rose from the dead three days later so that we might live in heaven with him for eternity. That's all of Christianity in a nut shell but of course it goes way deeper than that. I strongly urge you if you haven't to ask Jesus in your heart, by asking him to forgive you of your sins, save you and come into your life, and believe in him and repetent of your sins in your life. You only have to ask. That is all believe in him and he will save you. Have any more questions :) just ask! Of course you can always read the Bible and see what it has to say especially in the New Testamnet where Jesus talks specifically to those that love and follow him. Great stuff!=)

as far as I know you need at least a masters (if the masters is the terminal degree in that field ) in order to teach at university level. So the only thing you can teach is MBA classes. Unless you become a graduate student, then you can be a teaching assistant - they frequently teach their own classes, but don't get much money or the money goes toward the tuition fee. . Depends on your other experience and how good you are in your field if an university would hire you. Look at their job ads and see if something is there where you would fit.

To be fair, first of all, Mr. Ramsefeld did not commit all the. crimes and torture. If he condones to such practices. and orders his subordinates to do so then I readily. agree that he should be on trial as if he himself actually. took part, like Hitler or for that matter some of the Japanese war criminals.

I am not sure how you handle other doctors and even if that is appropriate.Or maybe just to announce you are opening a practice in town. Just send a simple letter business type with the information included.  In my small town where I live (rural area) the doctors that are coming place a ad in the local newspaper announcing the type of practice, insurance accepted, address, phone #, hours and when they will be accepting patients. And probably a good idea to notify the hospital (s) in the area for referrals. Good luck and God bless

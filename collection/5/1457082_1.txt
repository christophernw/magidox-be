Sometimes it can be medical.  Have your cat checked out at the vets.  Hopefully they can find a medical problem that can be fixed.  My husbands cat peed on our baseboard heaters and was that a terrible experence when we turned on the heat.  We had her checked several times to no avail.  She was very old and had started using everywhere for her litter box so sadly we had her put to sleep.

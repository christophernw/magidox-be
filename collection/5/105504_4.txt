Ask her boyfriend where he last saw her.. . Not to be mean, but your question seems strange and comes across as being shallow. I haven't been in many relationships, but I don't believe the truly lovely ones (by which I mean, you can have a fulfilling relationship with them) can be sought out by any known means. If you're just looking for fun, then just look for fun. If you want "the real thing", be patient and be happy with how cool life can be even without a girlfriend.

That is not true , u learn a second language because u need it and if u already speak English , then u dont need a second language , u just learn a second language for fun of it ... so many people speak spanish in America , American are very open to the other cultures since America is a multicultural country ... American know about diffrent cultures more than other countries .. America is a politically active country and knowing another language is always an asset ... and remmeber 50% of americans are immigrants or child of an immigrant so they speak a second language ... if u go to any burger shop , at least one of the staff speaks spanish ...  so if u open ur eyes u see number of bilangual people in America is more than any damn place in the world

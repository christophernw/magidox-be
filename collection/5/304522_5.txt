Apply for the job(s) anyway, and tell them in your covering letter that you have just left school/education, and you want to work in the area that they deal in, and you have heard good things about them.. . Or ask them if they will let you do a bit of work experience for a week or two, so that you can gain some experience.. . Most schools/education establishments send their students out on a weeks (or longer) work experience, usually while the older students are doing exams or as part of the coyrses.

Dear P,. . I empathize with your pain. I too have lost people I have cared for.. . It turns out however, that your friend did something really stupid and her death was a consequence of her action.. . Sin has negative consequences (even though it is unfashionable in our world to speak of sin and of consequences).... . The people responsible for your friend's death are (a) herself, (b) the drug pusher, (c) the guy who injected her, and (d) her friends who did nothing to stop her from doing heroin.. . It is not necessary for us to think that God killed her (as an example to us or for any other reason).. . God gave her the power to keep her life or throw it away. She chose to throw it away.. . We can choose to use her death as an example to us (or we can choose to not learn anything from this event).. . I know that what I am saying can sound harsh. But there is love behind these words. If the example of your friend's death keeps you from doing drugs, then her death was not in vain.. . Cordially,. John. http://www.GodSci.org

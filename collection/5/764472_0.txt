I would say that you need to have a conversation with him about why. Ask him if it is a fear of commitment and if so why. It could be that he thinks if you get married the relationship will change and he will lose something in the process. Worst case is that he doesnt want to marry you because he is still looking for something else. I think that most men have a fear of commitment because of the stereotypes that have been brought up around it. Like cut off from sex and their partner changes. I think those scenerios can happen in any relationship married or not. I dont know the ins and outs of your situation but it sounds like he might just be comfortable with the way things are right now. Maybe you could add to your question. Do you still have passion in the relationship? Do you have a good communication line open between the two of you? Do you question his love because of his actions? Has he cheated on you in the past or are you suspicious of his current activities? If you answer no to the first two and or yes to the last two questions you should consider a serious overview of your relationship. If you really want to be married to this person doubt cant be in the picture. Doubt and distrust can be the downfall to the foundation of a lasting relationship. I hope that you find an answer to this problem and that things work out for the best! Good Luck and Best Wishes! J

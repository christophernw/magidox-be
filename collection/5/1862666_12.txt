even Christ has said that people crave for a new Gospel, an easier way to be saved, an easier way into Heaven. some people find such new gospels in movies like the ones you mentioned and it is easier for them to grasp those concepts. in their view the Church and the Bible impose a rather strict way of what someone should do in order to be saved. there is no way of turning their minds around, not without the help of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

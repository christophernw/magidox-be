Of course Bush is raising the price of gas!  I mean think about it, he's from Texas and owns the most oil there--he's in love of being rich.  I mean seriously....all this crap that the hurricane brought in last year or so--it's such a lie!  The United States has TONS of oil to supply ourselves with, but since Bush is an oil maniac, he figures that this hurricane destroyed our oil in the Gulf (which it did), but makes it sound like there's no oil anywhere else in the county.  It's just an excuse for him to be able to say we no little oil now, and we have to raise the price.  Also, ever wonder why this war in Iraq is taking so long?  Did you even notice that the times we went to war was when George Bush senior and George W. Bush were both in office.  Why didn't we go to war when Clinton was in office?  I can go on and on, but I typed enough.  I'm sure you got my point!  Oh one more thing.....don't you think it's kinda strange that instantly when Clinton got out of the office, and Bush entered...the gas prices started to increase?

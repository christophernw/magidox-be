Because Chaucer is hard to read.. . Actually I think people lack word power: most use about 2000 words in their daily lives. So when they have to consult a dictionary hundreds of times to go through a novel, they feel discouraged.. . It's a shame that English has become so simplified in the common speech that nowadays the classics seem obscure, verbose and hypercomplex to many people.

Always give "year", make, engine size and model # when asking technical questions.. -Remove the cotter pin and "loosen" the nut in the center of the L rear wheel (step on the rear brake to keep the axle from turning).. -Remove the brake adjuster nut.. -Remove the drive chain (take note as to which direction the clip goes on the master link. When the vehicle is rolling foward, the opening of the clip should be pointing to the rear of the direction the master link is moving).. -Jack up the rear of the quad so the rear wheels are off the ground (or put a milk crate under the frame to hold the wheels up).. -There are 2 bearing housings (L & R) holding the axle to the frame. Remove the 3 bolts holding each bearing housing to the frame.. -Remove the entire rear axle with wheels attached, off of the quad.. -Remove the L rear wheel from the axle.. -Slide the bearing housing and brake panel off the axle.

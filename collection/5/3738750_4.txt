Greetings!. . Simple.  A debit card comes directly out of your bank account instantly.  Thus you must have the money in hand.. A credit card is in reaility making a personal loan to you each time you make a charge, and must be paid back in accordance with the terms and coditions of the card.. The interest they charge can be quite high.. . Good Luck

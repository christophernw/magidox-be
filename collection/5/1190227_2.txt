I'm not sure why Christians aren't supposed to smoke, and you already know that it'll cause harm to your body.  I can make an assumption why Christians (or people) shouldn't smoke is because not only that you'll harm your body, but you'll harm other people around you.  It's called second-hand smoke.  Besides, it causes bad breath anyways.

Please take note that the Islamic religion does not support terrorism in any way. However, the reason most of the terrorists that we know of are Muslim is because the Middle East is where the most terrorists are currently coming from. Since the main religion there is Islam, it's just a very negative affect on the rest of the Muslims. Some people still believe that our own government was behind the 9/11 attacks.

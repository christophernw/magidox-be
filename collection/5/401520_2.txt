When you incorporate, whoever is doing your article of incorporation gets paid to check that :).  + even if the name is used you can still use it as long as you don't compete with the other company.  For example I can name my company Apple or Microsoft and sell water.  Since I don't compete with either Apple or Microsoft they can't really do much.. . Rival

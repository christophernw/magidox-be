Actually no food is inherently bad for you.  Thee problem comes from eating too much of these foods and not balancing a diet.  A Big MAc and fries are great now and then, but alternate with grilled or roasted chiken and brocoli or something along those lines.  Of course junk foods are generally processed foods loaded with preservatives and other ingredients to enhance appearance and taste and while they may not be bad for you, fresh food prepared at home is much better.  Just enjoythe foods you like and remember moderation in all things.

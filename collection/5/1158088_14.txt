i have a dog who doesn't bark but its just his nature not to. I'm not real sure why cause we have another who does bark at everything. maybe its just the nature of the dog not to. and there are also some breeds of dogs who don't bark. or the vets can do an operation so the dogs don't bark. its probably just the nature of that dog. i wouldn't worry at least its a quiet dog.  :)

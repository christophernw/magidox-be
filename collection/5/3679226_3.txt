Because I work night shift and sleep all day and stay up all night. It is a whole lot better than masterbating isn't it? That's what I used to spend my time doing at night but I guess I just got burned out. Plus I got married to a know-it-all, thinks she's so independent, strong half black woman struggling to survive in this white man's run world woman. So I give advise to people who won't argue how my ideas are so unrealistic. Like Quiting my job and trying to find another job within two days. I got a temp job, but noooooooooo that is never good enough for her.

What specific science are you referring to?. If you mean general science basics (as in elementary school), then i thing that first you need to study it in order to advance to further classes in school and be able to understand what the teachers are talking about and secondly because a general knowledge of science basics offers an understanding of the mechanics and physics around you, so that you do not wander around life as an illiterate oaf living only of/ for TV, food and reproduction.. . PS:study spelling first.

Point 1: how do you know that we cannot evolve emotions, give me a reason.. Point 2. Emotions such as love, mercy and guilt (i would question whether guilt is a positive feeling) could have evolved as a way of surviving as social animals.. Point 3. Emotions are the result of neural and hormonal activity. they would appear as we evolved more complex brains.. I can't tell you all the steps involved in the evolution of emotions but their evolution makes sense from a materialist point of view, so I am showing less faith that the person who says "God did it".

Good Answer above.  If you need any help securing a mortgage give me a call @ 877-301-8667 ext 801.. . As far as Helper's comments.  Like he said it really depends on the area.  In Southern California for instance the condo's appreciate the same as a townhouse.  That's typically because condo's here aren't the beehive type you see on the east coast.  Mostly 2 Level similar to townhouse. East Coast, the condos tend to be a step below a townhouse and not appreciate as much.  Lots of factors involved though.  . . Tim

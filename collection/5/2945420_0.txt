Plant-like protists like algae, seaweed, and kelp for instance all play an important role in the marine food chain. Cyanobacteria, from which later plant-like protist life stemmed did help to oxygenate the atmosphere but phytoplankton, which is this plant-like protist life, forms the food base of the marine food chain according to my sources.

I know that school uniform is not the great but here are some reason that so comments that student said uniform is great:. . -Uniforms are quite comfortable even if they are a little dull.. -With uniforms we don't have to worried what to buy and found out that I have more times to do when I don't have to buy clothes for school.. -"Cool" or "In" doesn't matter any more and now I'm improving my grades without spreading time and worrying if I fit in.. -Parent safe money and now I had more school suppies(pencils) because I didn't buy that much clothes that I use to had to buy.. . There are some reasons people do like uniforms even sometimes its "dull".

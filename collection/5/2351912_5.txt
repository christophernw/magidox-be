Because for me, gay is a slang word for someone or something that is not cool. I say it all the time but I'm not calling my computer a homo when it runs slow, ya know.. . Others, I don't know. They could be meaning it in the degrading sense, and if they do that's wrong and they are being mean and ignorant, but that doesn't make them mean and ignorant people overall. . . and you'll get at least 3 gay responses, I'm betting.

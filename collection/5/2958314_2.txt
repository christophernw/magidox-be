Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) can help relieve itching caused by hives, but won’t affect itching from other causes. Most antihistamines also make people sleepy, which can help patients sleep who would otherwise be awake from the itch. Specific treatment of itching depends on the underlying condition that causes it. In general, itchy skin should be treated very gently. While scratching may temporarily ease the itch, in the long run scratching just makes it worse. In addition, scratching can lead to an endless cycle of itch—scratch—more itching. To avoid the urge to scratch, a person can apply a cooling or soothing lotion or cold compress when the urge to scratch occurs. Soaps are often irritating to the skin, and can make an itch worse; they should be avoided, or used only when necessary.. Creams or ointments containing cortisone may help control the itch from insect bites, contact dermatitis or eczema. Cortisone cream should not be applied to the face unless a doctor prescribes it. Probably the most common cause of itching is dry skin. There are a number of simple things a person can do to ease the annoying itch:. • don’t wear tight clothes. • avoid synthetic fabrics. • don’t take long baths. • wash the area in lukewarm water with a little baking soda. • for generalized itching, take a lukewarm shower. • try a lukewarm oatmeal (or Aveeno) bath for generalized itching. • apply bath oil or lotion (without added colors or scents) right after bathing . . Someone who itches all over should seek medical care. Because itching can be caused by such a wide variety of triggers, a complete physical exam and medical history will help diagnose the underlying problem. A variety of blood and stool tests may help determine the underlying cause.

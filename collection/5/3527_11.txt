Question?  Why is cat under bed?  If cat is under bed because it just likes being there (cats do these things) just leave him there.  He will come out when he wants to and not before.. If cat is scared of some thing (strangers, vacuum cleaner, thunder) when whatever it is that is scaring him stops, he will come out.  Broom handles, firearms will only make things worse.  why is it so important to get him out from under the bed?  . Is he hiding from vet visit?  This is an old cat trick.  Next time shut off all bedrooms before getting out cat carrier or even thinking the word "vet"  Cats can be extraordinarily perceptive about this.

well he didn't only pick the Jews Hitler picked the Siamese raise witch include Jews and Arabs and some others raises like the Russian and the polish cause he thought that these raises is lower than the German raise but after the war all the propaganda was that Hitler attacked only Jews and that was to gain international support to the declaration of Israel which as u should know before ww2 there was no Jews in the middle east but after ww2 the Jews moved to Palestine and declared the state of Israel in 1984 and it was impotent that they justify taking a country from it's real owners "the Palestinians" so they missled the people and picture that they are the only victim of Hitler when in reality the people that suffered the most from Hitler was the polish and the Russians not the Jews, I'm not saying that the Jews didn't suffer but the used it to justify the suffer they caused to the Palestinian witch makes you wonder what was worth what Hitler did or what the Israelis did.

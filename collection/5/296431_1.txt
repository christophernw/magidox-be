As ANO said,did u expect how did he(PBUH) die?I think u may decided that he died in jihad(as martyr)but ofcourse it wasnot important to die as martyr as he spent all his(pbuh) life for Islam,but ALLAH chose this way to die to indicate many points:1/the imprtance of the relationship between husbands(he died between his wife(Aisha)'s arms.                                            2/this death is a peaceful death as all his(PBUH)life and as the religion he(PBUH) was sent by.                               3/ALLAH Pointed out to all humanity the important stature of woman in Islam(visit www.islamonline.com then click spotlight on islam then click women in islam).        to know more about The Prophet Mohammed(PBUH) visit www.islamway.com/mohammed/?=eg

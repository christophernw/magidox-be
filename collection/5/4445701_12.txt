A few years ago a study of English teachers was made.  Each was given a one page essay to grade on grammatical correctness.  The essay was prepared by the English Deptartment of Cambridge University. It contained NO mistakes.  This test was given 10,000 english teachers throught the english speaking world (words with double spellings were deliberately avoided). Only 1 teacher marked it as no mistakes. 3 Gave it a 97 MOST gave it a failing grade.  This lead to several educational bodies establishing standards and ongoing evaluations of their teachers.. . I remember when I was on vacation in New England.  None of the students graduating from the state's Universities (Maine) had been able to pass the State Entrance exam for new teacher's even on a second attempt.

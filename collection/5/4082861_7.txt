Air is composed of eight or so chemical molecues and combines to create a gas. Water is composed of hyrogen and oxygen molecues and exists as a liquid or solid state (ice).  The difference in density of comparing a gas to a liquid is that the gas is less dense than the liquid, therefore offering less resistance to your hand.

Listen, don't be offended by any remarks on this forum, as people tend to be very sensitive about various topics which include religion and race.. . It's very good of you to apologize and clarify.  I am sure those that were offended probably didn't understand what you were asking and made an assumption.  It happens a lot on this forum.

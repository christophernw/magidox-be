The ONLY time that I've heard this, it came from a lady officer. She stated that the men are tempted by women in distress and fall victim to playing the hero and reaping the rewards that one gets from saving a vulnerable woman in a comprimising situation.. . This is her opinion but that was the ONLY time I had heard of something like this.  She also said that most of the married ones. cheat with attractive citizens.. . (?) Is it true?

#1----- Relax alot will come naturally :). . You can get a checking or savings account in order.. . Start researching auto insurance companies.  Find out what makes your premium higher and lower..  Be more responsible of your spending.  Learn to budget in accordance to what you need and what you can do without.. Don't ask your Father for money to buy a Mother's Day card and vice versa.. Honestly, once you start accepting yourself as an adult and you start portraying yourself as such, people will respect you as an adult.. This will light the fire!

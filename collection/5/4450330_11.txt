well yes the quick fix is to spit in it and i dont mean a quick patuey   i mean hock a lugie in that thing...  other than that there are products on the market for just that.  also hear shaving cream rub it in and rinse off  but nothing works perfectly just spit and rinse and if you get some fogging while you are down.... break the seal flood and refill with air

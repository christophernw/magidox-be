It means that when He's happy, I should be happy.  The Lord Rejoices in our weaknesses because the only one that gets the credit there is Him.  Like when I teach.  I don't like the center of attention, but the Lord allows me to do so.  He is joyed as I do His will and that becaomes a strength for me.

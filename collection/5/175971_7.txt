without a bunch of "spouting"- the rules are actually relatively simple- the basics are:. 1.love the Lord thy God with all your heart. 2.love thy neighbor as thyself. 3.for God so loved the world that he gave his only beggoten son that whosoever believeth in his name should not perish, but have everlasting life. .  all the rest are details- important details, but details. . if you and your chosen wife are married in the eyes of God, no sin obtains- marriage as it is currently "defined" is a contractual obligation requiring permission of "the State" which really has nothing to do with whether you are married or not- since when, in reality, does marriage have to be sanctioned by "Ceasar" rather than God?

You must first forgive the one or ones you hate, then ask them to forgive you, that will clean your heart. If they choose to carry all the hatred in their souls, then that's their business, but you have done all you can do. The BIBLE says if you don't forgive,then GOD will not forgive you. May the good LORD take a liking to you and bless you all the days of your life.***

Alot of people do move, but this country and the Americans in it have freedom of speech. We have the right to state our opinion and not everyone will agree to the differant opinions that each person have, but that doesn't mean we dislike the USA. People do not like alot of things that are happening here. There is good and bad here as like any other country.

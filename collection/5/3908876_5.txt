Cavities are caused by an acid that eats away at the enamel of the teeth.  The bacteria in your mouth plus the food that you eat turns into acid.  If you don't remove the food and bacteria within twenty four hours, then it turns into the acid that makes cavities.  Make sure to brush and floss everyday, then you should not have to worry about it.

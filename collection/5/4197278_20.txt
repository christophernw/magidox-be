I used to have to clean out dog kennels which were full of dog crap. Oh and move a big dustbin of months old dog crap around a garden. The smell was horrible, after a week or so of doing it everyday I developed an almost Pavlovian (no pun intended) response to the dustbin and would begin gagging and wretching at the site of it.. . There was this other time that I had to clean out a settling tank/pump reservoir in a below ground kitchen, basically the pump had stopped working because it was clogged up with impacted, rotting food and waste. Again the smell was awful, the whole tank was encrusted with this stuff that had the texture of pate and looked like grey goo. I had to cut the stuff off the sides of the tank in slices. I wound up being sick in on the customers kitchen floor and in their sink because the smell was making me wretch so much.. . Ahhhhh happy times.

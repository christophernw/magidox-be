When you use sage, you could chop it but I prefer to just "bruise" it to get the essential oils out of it. To do this, I take the leaf or leaves, and take the back side of a knife (the non-sharp side) and beat the leaves until you start to smell sage strongly. I then take the leaves, put it in a cheesecloth, tie it off and put in whatever you are making (unless it is stuffing or the like, then chiffonade it). The cheesecloth makes it easy to get the leaves out when you are done.

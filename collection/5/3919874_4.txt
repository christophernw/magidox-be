Being an adult is hard, but so is being a college student. To be very honest I'm 41 & don't know much but a good way to learn is by listening to others especially the ones with different opinions that's how you learn.When I graduated 6th grade they put in my year book what they thought that everyone would be doing in 20 years & for me they put that I'll still be asking questions,and I still am. Ignore the idiots you come in to contact with & try and be as happy as you can. Good luck

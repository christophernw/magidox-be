The spray bottle method just reinforces the cat's line of thinking: "If mommy/daddy is not here, it's OK for me to drink out of the fish tank".  Maybe you need to examine your cat's source of drinking water.  Are you emptying her bowl every day, washing it out with clean, soapy water and rinsing it thoroughly? Are you giving her fresh, clean water every time the bowl starts to get low?  . . Some cats also like a source of running water to drink from- which is why she may want to drink from the fish tank (because of the air bubbles).  Some pet stores sell a water bowl that plugs in and filters the water through a tank and out a little spout, into a little bowl. It runs continuously until empty. Supplying your cat with one of those water dispensers may also help solve your problem.

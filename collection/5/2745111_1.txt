Because we are taught that we only have two options: either virgin or whore.  Life circumstances force some of us toward virgin and some toward whore (this is a gross overgeneralization of course, but so was your question), but in our society it is currently the "whore" modality that gets rewarded the most.  Many women feel that they cannot be happy or successful without these societal rewards, so they act in ways that will get them this recognition.

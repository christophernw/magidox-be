The penis, much like the human male, is used for passing urine and for transmission of semen.. It differs from the human penis in that the dog's penis actually has a small bone in it, as well as a bulb near the base on either side, which swells 5 times its size with blood, once the dog has his penis inside the female.. This bulbous, along with the female's vaginal muscle, ensures that the 'tie' cannot be broken until all the semen is pumped from both testicles, which happens as alternative spurts from each teste. . Once the tie has occurred, you MUST WAIT until the female relaxes her vaginal 'locking' muscle and breaks the tie to release the male.. If you attempt to pull them apart, you will cause serious pain and damage to both the male and the female dog.

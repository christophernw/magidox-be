Smile, say that it was good of him to enlighten you with his/her/it's point of view, and that you'd get back once you'd figured the depth of the person's insights which that person was so good to share with you.. . The next time the person tries to corner you, smile and rush off saying that you'd a broken garter or broken a heel or something like that.. . Guys will have to think of some reason or the other to fob off the person without bopping him, cause violence will feed to his frenzy and make him a martyr, at least in his own eyes.

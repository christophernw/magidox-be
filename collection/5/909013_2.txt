From what I understand SSRIs work for those moderatly depressed the best. The pathways involved in anxiety and depression appear to both be sertonergic pathways which is why an SSRI drug could work on both. However, according to my book and my limited understanding a lot of what we know about both is still in the theory area and we are trying to better understand the cause and cure of the disorders.

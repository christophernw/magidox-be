A stick turns into a snake.. A sea parts so that thousands of people can walk through it.. Water is turned into wine.. A man walks on water.. A man rises from the dead.. . Now tell me why we should take those stories seriously. Because that sounds like a work of fantasy to me.. . Edit: OP, I think you need to go back to school because you obviously have no clue what Evolution actually says. You've only shown yourself as being uneducated.

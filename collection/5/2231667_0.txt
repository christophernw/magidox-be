In bound call center is taking calls and outbound call center is making calls.  Customer service is probably the most stressful job out there.  I'm working right now and I'll tell you, I take an average of 90 calls a day from life insurance policy holders complaining about their policy.  The definition of customer service is helping the customer out as much as possible and answering any questions they have using all of your resources, common sense and honesty.

You are right. The cost of fuel alone will drop the prices of all SUV's and pick up trucks too. Keep doing what you are doing, maybe you can ask a few landscapers or construction sites. Just keep the for sale sign on it and find as much free advertisings as you can. Make a couple of tear off posters with a phone number and a pic and post them in food stores. You may get lucky. Last straw wwould be to trade it in for what you really want. Sometimes the dealers will do anything to make a sale!. Good luck

Yes, soak in water.. Clean any effected areas.. Cut nail STRAIGHT across.. take a little (VERY little) bit of cotton from a cotton ball, put UNDER (yes this will hurt) the part of the nail that wants to grow down into the toe, and repeat EVERY night, until the nail is trained to grow upward. Then, never, ever, cut toe nails any way except straight across.

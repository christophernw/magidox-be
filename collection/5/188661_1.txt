my uncle had them a LONG time, used prep-H, finally had to resort to surgery. sorry, there's no other route.. i got them from my first birth of my daughter and they HURT!. prep-H worked then..the Dr. recommended that I boil water and fill the toilet and sit on the steam..it's called a "sit's bath", trust me, it really helps. Try It! It really helps until you get a permanent solution.. hoping your ok soon!

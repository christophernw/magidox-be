Communism, conservatism's traditional enemy, committed suicide years ago. The right, always in need of an enemy to hate, turned on the liberal side of America as their new enemy. If they were ever able to end liberalism, I have no doubt that they would need a new enemy to hate and would fracture into splinter right-wing groups and hate each other over minutia.

The ignorance and the lazy answers have it in my opinion.. .  I keep hearing of lower voter turnouts for primaries and stuff. It almost seems like each successive generation is more indifferent than the next, like world and local events don't affect their country and their nieghborhood.... . The sad reality is when I vote for a pres., I don't vote for the person I like (unless there is one), I vote against the person I don't like or has policies I disagree with..

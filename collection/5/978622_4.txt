If you think the child is old enough to appreciate it/slash receive it, there are a ton of different things you can do but if the child is pretty young, like three or four, you can find these chocolates that look like rocks in a lot of stores. When the child is around, casually take them out and start eating. When they ask what you are eating tell them that you're eating rocks and would he/she like some. Keep them going for a while, ti can be really cute and they'll love you after wards when you give them some of your chocolate!

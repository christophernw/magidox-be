hahahahahah, im sorry but ive changed 3 times now and if im going to the supposed christian hell ( if there was a place if i eevr get there ill send a post card lololol) then i must be going there.. You should have no guilt, you are doing what you need to reach a higher power. I feel all roads lead to a divine concept, and how ever we all get there is fine as long as we get there.....I think youll do fine.

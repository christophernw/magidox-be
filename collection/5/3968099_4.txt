They can be called "baby" hairs as well. They will grow but at a much slower rate than the rest of your hair...I think it has something to do with the pores around the edges of your scalp being smaller than the rest...but I'm not too sure. . . I agree with your agitation though...they drive me nuts too when I'm trying to put my hair up...

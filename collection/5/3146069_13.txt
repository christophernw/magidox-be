It is not only black people, it can be white people too.. But nevermind their colour, the problem is they are ignorant and uncaring of other people's needs.. You go to a theater to watch a movie, you go to a phone booth to talk on the phone and hopefully people will realize that cell phones are an invasion of their and other's privacy.

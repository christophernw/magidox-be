Put some rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball. Lay down on your side with the affected ear up. Squeeze a few drops of alcohol into your ear. Lay there for a few seconds before you get up. You may want to stick a cotton ball in that ear to catch the alcohol that leaks out. Leave the cotton ball in for a few minutes. This will almost always get water out of the ear. Give it a 2nd try if it doesn't work the first time.

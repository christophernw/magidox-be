in america it is a result of culture choice.when segrigation was defeated by black solidarity it also created a social program that produced government benefits for blacks,encouraging blacks to intergrate at a level of productivety less than what they are capable of.now a system of benifits are in place that can be used by all minoritys.blacks have a sense of integrety that keeps their benifits in their family.other minoritys have tribal roots,sharing their benifits over a larger group...thus depleting the system leaving blacks in poverty without traditional work ethics...the blame can be placed anywhere,depending on your point of veiw...

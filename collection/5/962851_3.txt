I heard about a guy who collected about 20,000 plastic bottles and put them in net bags and sewed all the bags together and built his own island out of them. He covered the surface with dirt and planted grass and shrubs and built a little house on it and now he doesn't have to pay property taxes anymore. He tows his island around with a bass boat and parks it wherever he wants to live at the time. Pretty cool idea.

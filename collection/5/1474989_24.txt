It's hard when God does not meet our expectations by intervening when we make stupid choices.  Your anger, sadness, and hurt are normal.  But whoever told you that God kills people as examples was not paying attention to the love of God or the questions your heart is asking.  That person probably thought they were helping by making something up, but no one fully understands death except the one who conquered it.. . Your friend did not die because God issued a command from heaven. She died doing illicit hard drugs.  You are probably mad at her for being so stupid since you love her so much.  It's hard to be angry with our dead loved ones because we don't want to betray their memory.  But your friend would understand that you are mad because you love her and wanted her to stay with you, so you could live your lives in one another's company. . . We all die at some time or another.  Some of those deaths occur to newborn babies, some to ripe old people.  God does not prevent deaths because God's love can work even through and beyond death.   I could say more on this subject, but I think it's probably more important right now that you focus on the love you still have for your friend.  God shares that love for her.  Her death was not for a cruel lesson, nor was it a demonstration that God no longer loves her.  God still loves your friend more than you can ever know.  Love for your friend is something you and God have in common.  Maybe God can help you learn to keep loving her even though she's gone?  It's okay to be openly pissed off at God, too.  If anyone can take it, God can.  But don't block out your greatest ally in love just because things turned out differently than you expected.

I usually check the brownies to see if the edges are crisping faster than the middle, if they are, I line the edges with a strip of aluminum foil to keep them from cooking faster than the middle. Try not to over grease the edges of your baking dish if you use metal, pyrex glass works to cook a bit more evenly, but you still have to watch the edges.

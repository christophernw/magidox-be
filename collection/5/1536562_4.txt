Can you not do an iron hydroxide precipitation? FeOH precipitates at about pH 3 - 5. Add FeCl (1 mg/ml) and bring the pH up using NaOH or NH3. You will see the precipitate form and then just left it settle/centrifuge it. However, you might want to check to see FeCl scavenges Au. I would of thought that it does though.

no no no.. satan was made of fire while angels r made of light... satan was not created by god to serve as temtor.. it was created just like any other creature.. but when god nade adam and eve god order all angels and satan to kneel to adam.. they all did except for satan... so god swore to have it cursed all of its life.. and satan swore to tempt humans to disobey god and go the wrong path and it asked god to make it live till the end af all life (cuz it knew that god is capable of ending its life any time) so god allowed it to live till the end of life . so ppl r free to choose whether to obey god or not.. . if it wasnt for satan we wouldnt know life the way we do now, we would be in heaven without having the risk of disobeying god and be judged for what we have done wrong

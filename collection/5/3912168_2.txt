I don't know your budget but I am a single person that purchased a time share some time ago with only a small amount per month.. I am now able to travel the USA and the world abroad. The only cost is my plane ticket or i could easily drive within short distance, etc.  I have paid a total of $5,000. over a period of 5 years. I will have accomodations for the rest of  my life and be able to pass it down to my family.  You are welcome to use my place if you like?  It was a  smart investment on my part!

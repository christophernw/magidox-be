That all depends on why they chose to go vegi.. . My wife is a vegetarian because of the way that the animals are killed.  She's not dumb, she agrees that animals are on earth for us to eat, but she doesn't think that a bullet in the head of a cow hanging upside down is right, as they are moving so if the bullet doesn not get them right, the cow is in agony until killed properly.. . She is a total animal lover and would put an animal before a human as humans have choices.. . I myself eat meat which she accepts, as do our children.

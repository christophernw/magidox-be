The sky appears blue because the wavelength of blue light is short and therefore is easily scattered by the air molecules it hits when it passes through the atmosphere. The other colors pass through relatively undisturbed. Wherever you look in the sky, some of the scattered blue waves hit your eyes, so that's what you see.

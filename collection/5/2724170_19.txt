Dogs have senses that many humans don't have. Even though you don't know there may be another dog calling somewhere in the area. Also, it is said that spirits find dogs to talk to when they are alone. Dogs have a sixth sense that let them hear and see things humans can't find to understand. If you hear of a dog whisperer he/she can probably  find what is wrong with you're dog. It may seem annoying but it's only that wierd sixth sense kicking in. On a television show I watched on Discovery a couple days ago showed a way to help. Take a camera and turn it on and move it around the are a where the dog is barking. If there is a "spirit" , then you will see a light in the shape of a circle. Then, move the dog away from the area and try to calm  him down(petting,playing etc.)After move the dog back to the area and if he/she still barks repeat the steps.I tried it with my dog it worked ;so I guess it will work with yours also.Good Luck!!!!:-)

Phuket ( POO-KET) is unfortunately overdeveloped and no longer a hidden secret.. Based on the pictures, I think Bali might be more romantic and more interesting architecturally.. In general Thais are very nice though and Thai food is the best.. I am not sure I will feel 100% safe in Bali from previous history with terrorists and bombing.  It might be OK now, however.. I don't think you can go wrong with either one.

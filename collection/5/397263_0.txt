Put the litter box in the bathroom, it's the most common place for them. Also, if your cat doesn't tear them up, you can use litterpan liners, to make cleaning easier.. Do scoop-cleaning several times a day, maybe get a ''litter locker'' container for the waste, as that helps enclose the smell.. I usually do a full litter box clean, weekly or bi-weekly. (I do not use liners).. Try switching litter. They have a "Small Spaces" litter, that works pretty good. I think it lives up to it's name, and is truly suitable for small spaces. Helps keep the odor down.. . Also, depending on what you are feeding your cat, maybe feeding her a better quality food, will help with the odors.

The Storm Prediction Center (SPC), located in Norman, Oklahoma, is part of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), operating under the control of the National Weather Service (NWS), which in turn is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department of Commerce (DoC). Until October 1995, the SPC was known as the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC) and was located near Kansas City, Missouri.. The Storm Prediction Center is responsible for forecasting (identifying, describing, and quantifying) the risk of severe weather caused by severe convective storms (specifically, those producing tornadoes, hail 3/4" or larger, and winds 58 MPH or greater), as well as winter and fire weather. It does so primarily by issuing convective outlooks (AC), severe thunderstorm watches (WS) and tornado watches (WT) ("weather watches" (WW)), and mesoscale discussions (MCD or MD).. There is a three stage process in which the area, time period, and details of weather parameters forecasted goes from more general to more specific, also with heightening alertness.

Employers know you will not have experience if you are a school leaver so if an employer demands experience from you, it is just an excuse to turn you down. Turn the question on its head and ask how they can expect a school-leaver to have experience. More seriously, find out why they are using that excuse. Look smart, sound confident and be enthusiastic about getting a career in the field you have chosen. And don't take rejection personally. Getting a job is a numbers game. Paper your wall with rejection letters and try all of the very wise tricks in the other answers. You are worth something. Don't let rejection grind you down.  Good luck with your career.

Try using a sensitive facial cleanser like Cetaphil. Be absolutely sure to wash your face before bed. In the mornings (unless your skin is extremely oily) you may only need to rinse your forehead with warm water and pat dry. To much exfoliation, towel wiping and facial scrubs can cause breakouts.. . If all else fails, a dermatologist can prescribe a good rx like Tri-luma. Although it is not always covered by medical carriers you may be able to obtain samples or pay out of pocket. . . Good luck to you!

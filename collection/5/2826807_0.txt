Its the feeling of it saturating your throat and body..it soothes the body and the body always seems to want to be hydrated. I get the same thing..I'll drink a water bottle then my mouth feels dry so I end of drinking another. Don't worry about it..it's healthy for you and your doing your organs a favor.

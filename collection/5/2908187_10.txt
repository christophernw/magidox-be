Do not go to the police unless you want to due your time. You can call your local bail bondsman on the phone and they can tell you if you have a warrant for free.Then you can decide what to do, you can also see if you can do a non arrest bond or if it is not really nothing and you want to save money, turn yourself in. The hard part is going, after that its ok.

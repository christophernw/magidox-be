Beauty contests good for society? I doubt it.It is fostering the idea that if a woman is not beautiful enough to enter a contest she is somehow less of a woman.Though many of the world's most beautiful ignore the contests. Feminists have referred to such contests as cattle markets and some male judges have taken advantage of the contestants offering their vote for favours. I cannot think of one reason for these contests to exist,except to keep male TV viewers glued to the screen.

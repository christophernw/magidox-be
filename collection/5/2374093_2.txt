The temperature above which the liquid phase of a substance cannot exist.. . www.everyscience.com/Chemistry/Glossary/C.php. . The critical temperature of a material is the temperature above which distinct liquid and gas phases do not exist. As the critical temperature is approached, the properties of the gas and liquid phases become the same. Above the critical temperature, there is only one phase. The critical pressure is the vapor pressure at the critical temperature. The critical molar volume is the volume of one mole of material at the critical temperature and pressure. .... . en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_temperature. .

As a qualified auto engineer and also college lecturer i would advise you not to attempt this task unless you have the confidence, knowledge and equipment for this.  The procedure is relativley simple however please remember if you get this wrong you willl not only be putting yourself at risk but also members of the public as well.  Go to your local library and see if there is a haynes manual, check out the section on brakes then if you think the task is too complicated go to a local garage

If you know their SS#, you better be careful not to let anyone know you know it, or you could get in trouble.. . . As for the license plate, go to a DMV near you, and tell them your situation. They might not let you have it, because it's private information. . . . If you know a cop personally, ask them to input the number on their computer, and the data will come up.

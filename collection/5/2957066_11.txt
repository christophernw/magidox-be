It sounds terrible, but I'd agree with the blood drawn aspect. They'll be alright.  There's some territoriality going on there...maybe one is newer than the other?   Hopefully, you don't have white carpet.  Chances are that they're playing and having one helluva lot of fun.  They'll figure out that they're the same  species soon enough.

I found three possibilities... . 1) Festus is a long poem by the English poet Philip James Bailey. . . 2) Porcius Festus was a Roman governor of Judea from approximately 60 to 62 AD, who is mentioned in the writings of the historian Josephus and in the book of Acts in the New Testament..  . 3) Festus was a late Roman historian whose summary of the history of Rome was commissioned by the emperor Valens in preparation for war against Persia. . . My guess would be #2.. A lot of biblical references when it comes to naming cities..

a reverse merger would be a division of a single company or business entity into two or more companies such as when AT&T split into many small companies.. . However if the questioner really meant to ask what a reverse mortgage is then this is the answer.  A reverse mortgage is a particular type of mortgage or loan that is secured by alien on real property that is available to persons over 62 years of age in which no payment is made by the person obtaining it so long as they continue to reside in on the property.  Upon death or upon ceasing to reside in the property the mortgage comes due and must be paid then in full.

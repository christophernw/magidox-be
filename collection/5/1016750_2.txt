Go into your menu, then select settings..find the number that has 'security' next to it, select by pressing OK. Enter your security code which is usually the last 4 digits of your mobile number. In there you will find a selecting which says 'erase contacts'...this will lead you through the steps to deleting the entire phone book of contacts at once. Hope this helps, good luck!

Good question - isn't it?  I really hope you don't expect an answer to this one here...do you!?  Some questions are subjective in life -- you have to find your own answer to this one...don't look for someone else to tell you what all these mean to you.  Have the courage and motivation to find your own path to these type of questions.  You are not asking us 1+1...you are asking someone to tell you what your values are...get it?  Think about what I am saying...you'll get it.

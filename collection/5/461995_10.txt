A sermon of any kind is boring and sometimes scary.. . The very first time I went to church, the minister scared the absolute s**t out of me and I ran out crying and told my dad I was never going back to church again.. . I have since returned to churches but only for weddings, etc and they still to this day conjure up feelings of uneasiness.. . I guess that is why I am not religious. That and the whole thing just doesn't make sense to me. Oh and because sex is a sin. Well on that premise, I will be going to hell. But I'm having a f**king good time getting there lol.

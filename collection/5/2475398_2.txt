actually Utah is not a Mormon State and they build temples Everywhere in the world, Utah is not considered Holy ground to the LDS if you will. and that's why... you should visit a temple in your area, but if you do come to the US there are many beautiful LDS temples including the one in Utah, I like the picture I saw of the one in new zealand personally .

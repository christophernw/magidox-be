Delta E is a term used to describe change in internal energy which is the sum total of the kinetic and potential energies of the constituent particles.Internal energy can be changed only by allowing heat to move in/out of the system or by work done on/by the system.It is often defined as the heat absorbed at constant volume. Heat change at constant pressure is what we call change in enthalpy or delta H.

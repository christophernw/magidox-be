Maybe just seems that way because when you're down... it's easier to be knocked that little bit more when you're up and on top... but when you are on good form again... you can handle things better... I had an awful year of 2005 and thought could I possibly get any more bad luck and I did... 2006 had been a much better year... here's to 2007 and hoping it's even better.... . Chin up... chocolate helps... as well as a good friend to moan at  . . xx

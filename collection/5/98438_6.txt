Basic rules: . .  use to separate more than two articles in a series: Our flag is red, white, and blue.  (The comma before "and" is optional).. . use between the day and the year in a date :  June 5, 2006.. . Use between city and state:  Austin, Texas. . use to join two complete sentences with a conjunction:  We went to the mall, and we bought a new radio.. . use to set off introductory elements:  Mr. Smith, do we have a test today?  As I told you yesterday, the test is next week.. . use to set off words that rename a noun:  Mr. Smith, our teacher, gave a test today.. . use to set off words that you could put in parentheses:  My sister, who's not really too bright, got lost in thought.. . use to set off introductions and closings in letters:  Dear Aunt Mary,....Sincerely, .... . . These are the basic rules.  There are always exceptions, but these rules will get you through most situations.

Why would anybody in their right mind want to reduce the differences?  It's the differences that make the world go 'round!  Feminists want to reduce the differences and look what happend (and still happens) to them...they become angry, unhappy and live unfulfilling lives.  That should teach you something.  Men and women were designed the way they were because that's how they best function.  It's extreme arrogance to think we know better how we should have been made.  It would be like letting your child tell you when he should brush his teath and go to bed...bass-ackwards.

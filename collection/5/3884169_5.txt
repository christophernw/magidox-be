Every church is different.  If I were you, I would find out what time the service starts on Sunday, and then just walk in, and sit yourself down.  It takes a couple of Sundays to know if you really are comfortable in that particular church.  You can try one church here, and try one there or there across the street.  Until you find that niche, then make it as your church and be a regular attender.  Join activities if the church has it whether it be a weekday fellowship or whatever.  You make it sounds like there ought to be a fee to joining a church - that's morally wrong if the church tries to collect fee to join.  Try a little here and there.  It's best to go on a Sunday.

Fossil Fuels are formed as a result of high pressure combined with the movements of the Earth on plants, animals and for that matter even marine animals which have been buried in the earth by layers of sediments. They are very important because once refined they give products such as petrol, natural gas etc which is the backbone of all industries as it provides power. Products like petrol are also used to run vehicles.

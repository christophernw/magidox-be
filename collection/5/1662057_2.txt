Well, I sure don't lack an education. It's public, for the most part.. lots of people can get one, if they're determined. . . I have a boyfriend.. and I may lack lots of money, but there's more to life than money. Being a black woman does not mean you can't get anywhere in life. . . Are you that insecure?. . You're not honest.. you're insulting and insecure. Black women can't get boyfriends..?. . Women of all ethnicities are concerned with "their looks" and "their hair color." Women of all ethnicities have to struggle for what they want..  We have different skin colors, but we all pretty much face some of the same things in life.. There IS such a thing as "gender" discrimination that all women face.. . Thinking negatively of yourself isn't going to get you anywhere.

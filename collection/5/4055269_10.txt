This was one of the major points that the founders agreed on in order to keep any one branch from getting to be too powerful.  It seems to have worked fairly well.  But it does put an enormous burden on the judiciary, who have the last say, and the duty and obligation (but not realistically enforceable) to interpret the law and not to make it.  Sometimes they get it wrong.

if you were once close to God then you already know the answer to your question... God does not look at age.. we will all meet death .. that is the price we paid for the beginning sin.. God did not take your friend to teach any one a lesson.. He took your friend to have you question him... your friend was a lost sheep in the depths of distruction even though she only did the drug one time, she was in the darkness of the people that she was with.. God called her up to bring her home in the light.. you shouldn't be sad because she is safe now and no longer in the dispare that she was in here on earth... she is happy and so should you be... take your friends experience and live life the way God intended you to live... talk to Him and he will show you the way... trust me the burden of hatred and dispare will be lifted and you and the memory of your friend will live forever in peace..

Funny story:. . Years ago, a strip club opened in downtown Kansas City. The local churches got together and decided they would hand out cookies and pamphlets in front of the club to keep people out. They chose a Catholic church to do it because they figured seeing nuns outside would leave no doubt in anyones mind that it was a "sin" to go into the club.. . The club started running radio ads telling people to make sure they got their free cookies on the way in. The nuns were gone the next day..... . -SD-

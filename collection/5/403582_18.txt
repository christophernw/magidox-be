Wow, you are lucky you werent killed.  I guess you don't want the lecture about how you should not have been driving without insurance OR a licence!! My GOD kid what were you thinking?  And you had your little brother with you too?. . You know, bad as this is, take it as a BIG, BIG lesson in life, because you made a very BIG, BIG mistake.. . Now you must pay for your actions.  You are the one that made the error in judgement, a HUGE error.  . . Now everyone has to suffer for that.  . . This is why they have rules, and laws, and why children should not drive until they safely pass a driver's exam.  Having or not having money is no excuse for anything.  Now you have no car too.. . You will just have to live with your actions.  They are horrifying but think how much worse it could have been.  Your mom could have come home to two corpses.. . You should be giving major thanks and blessings to have your life this thanksgiving. . . I hope you learned a valuable lesson because I would hate to think you would do this again.  What a bad example you set for your little brother and what does your mom have to say about all this?  I certain hope she didn't condone you driving but somehow I get a suspicion she knows...or is it habit for you to steal the car and take your little brother?  I hope you are a minor because you could be charged with a lot of things and you face never being able to afford insurance now for this stunt.

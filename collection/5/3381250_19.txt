I know it can seem that way to you now.. . But since you are only 12, you will find that after growing up and being around all different races...they all have people in them that are bigots.. . Every race has good people and bad people, it isn't just the black race that has racism as a problem.. . I hope that the few you have met haven't soured you on all people who are black. . . I am 35 and I must say that my friends come from all over the race, religion and sexual preference continuum, and not one of them are bigots....you're just meeting the wrong people.. . Please do not mistake the racists you have met as examples of an entire race....that in itself is bigoted.. . Good luck to you........

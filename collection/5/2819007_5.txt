From a crocus . can also be used  for dying your hair after you boil it up in water and strained off .Unfortunaley i didnt know that and just added it to a bowl and put on my hair- Gosh! it took days to get the little flower seed bits out. I think i will just stick to the food receipes in future .      :)

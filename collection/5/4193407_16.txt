To be honest, this is just somethings I have noticed between my friends, classmates, and just random people I run into, of all ages.  Being from a middle class family, as are most of my friends and acquaintances, we just don't feel that our thoughts/beliefs are being represented by any candidate.  I know, I have tried to get interested in politics, I gave it a good three year run, but many of the aspects being discussed are who to go to war with, or not to war with.  Most of us are just trying to get through school, or get to a point in our lives where we can devote some attention to political matters.  . . And speaking of 'teens today,' no offense, but look at the age group of teens.  Only 18 & 19 year olds may vote, so lumping in the other teen years with that age group might construe peoples thought processes.  . . I guess to boil it down, most 'young people' don't seem to care about politics because to be honest, politicians don't care about us, we aren't contributing millions of dollars to their campaigns, so they really have no reason to appeal to our wishes, also, alot of people vote either straight republican/democrat, very few people pay attention to TV debates (again, topics of little interest to my generation.). . Just some thoughts.

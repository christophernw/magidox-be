I figure that Buddhists are like Jews and Catholics - they are people.. . Additionally Budhism, Judaism and Catholocism are all essentially the same as well - each says the truth or spirit of God is within.. . It's just when people get involved to adulterate these pristine beliefs with their own personal agendas that we have religious conflict.

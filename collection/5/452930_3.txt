If the money is not in your PayPal account, then someone may be scamming you.  I've heard there are some scam-artists that buy stuff on eBay who send you an e-mail similar to the one PayPal sends claiming to give you money or saying it will be funded as soon as they receive the items.  Of course, they just want you to send them stuff and then they never give you any money.. . If you log in to PayPal and there is no money there, they you haven't been paid.. . You may need to "confirm" your account with PayPal though so check that too.

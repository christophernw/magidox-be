Don't provoke it.  Don't chase it around and torture it.  If you want to play with it, buy proper toys, or tie a piece of paper to a string.  Teach it to play with toys and not hands...feet...hair...faces...etc.  When it misbehaves make sure the cat knows it has done wrong.  Lemon water or water with a tiny bit of flea spray (not much you don't want to hurt the cat) does wonders and you don't have to get near it.  If you are not opposed to the technique a good thump on the nose or a light flick of the ear may also be a deterent but the cat also may percieve this as playing.  Understand the cat is not being mean.  It is an animal and thinks its actions are either playing or defending what it thinks belongs to it.  You just have to modify this behaviour so it suits you.

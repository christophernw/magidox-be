Wimbledon, England is always rainy....there wouldn't be the perfect season to host the tourny....plus there are other tournaments going on all year round so they'd be stepping on toes if they held one at the same time >.<. . **Plus if they held it any other time than summer, the players would be frozen and there'd be snow instead of rain which would be worse! =P

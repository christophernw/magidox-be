Its funny that you should ask that because I once ask myself that very same question several times. Finally, I came up with the answer that that life is tuff and will always be unfair. Im 27 years old and even thought about backing out of my engagement before marrying but now im glad that i didn't. It took awhile for me to realize that life isnt the fariy tale you have in your mind. I use to envy others thinking how great it most be for them but turns out it wasnt so great either. I dont think i could picure myself ever being without my husband now knowing him. I use to think that my life could probably be better with someone else, better as in the feeling of love but you  really need to sit down and think of pro's and con's.

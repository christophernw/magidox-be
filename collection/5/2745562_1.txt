I'd say go to a couple of different ones. You probably have an idea of what's going on with your car, and if they all say something different than the other, i'd maybe find someone who you know (friend, co-worker) who'll check your car just to make sure, or ask other people who've had their car repaired by a shop, see which ones they recommend. Some car shops like to lie, and make up problems, especially to women, because they think we know nothing mechanically about cars.

This actually is based on a true story.  In old England a young scholar was reading a book under a tree and eating an apple when a wild boar (pig) charged him.  He threw the book and the apple at the boar to stop from being dinner himself and the boar got the apple in his mouth and choked.  The cook then took the boar as is and roasted it...apple and all.... and a new tradition was begun.

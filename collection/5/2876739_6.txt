You have to first both be open minded to change and second you must both want to try and resolve the problems you face.  If either of you hold on to a certain grudge or a certain incident and each take turns bringing up the past, then you live in the past and the fight just becomes a vicious circle and you never resolve anything.  Which leaves you both unhappy and thinking that the "other" just doesn't understand 'you'.  Well, counselors teach you ways of staying focused on the future and living in the present and they help you learn not to hurt each other or to strike out with words in anger, words hurt, they don't fix anything or resolve the problem.  I learned a life long lesson from a counselor - he told me if I was mad about something my husband did, I had to bring it up to him....TIMELY... In other words, if I didn't mention that what he did upset me or made me mad or if I didn't try to discuss the matter with him.....then I needed to understand 'The Rule' and that is -  if you don't bring up what made you mad and try to resolve the issue within 2 weeks then you lose it forever.....You no longer have the right to bring it up.  Neither one of you are allowed to bring up something that is more than 2 weeks old! EVER....  See this way, when you have a disagreement about something - you can't throw the "past" at each other and this makes you have to focus on now.....and try to see what you can do to resolve your problems....... It makes you live now and not carry old wounds and/or baggage with you.....but sometimes you just have too much baggage...and I didn't stay married to him but I learned some good life lessons and it made my next relationship work.  Remember, when the door closes God opens another.

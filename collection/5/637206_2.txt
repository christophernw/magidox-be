i went to dubai this summer.  dubai is growing very very fast and is predicted to be, in several years, one of the largest internationally known cities in the world.  the worlds only 7 star hotel is located there and there are many other tourist attractions.  there is alot of money in dubai and the economic boom they are experiencing right now is going to be much much larger in several years

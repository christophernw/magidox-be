I don't know if they were offended or were just trying to correct your thinking. As a Christian I don't believe in "luck" because that would mean that there is some force in this universe that could cause something to come about apart from the will of God.. . However, the people who responded to you in that manner may have not been considering that their response was bordering on being rude since they should have had sense enough to know that you were being polite and not trying to get them to worship some "god" of luck.. . If they had really cared they could have taken the time to explain why they don't believe in "luck" or they could have just said thanks for your good wishes.. . Christians are imperfect people just like everyone else. The difference is that a born again Christian is in the process of becoming more like Jesus as God changes them over time. For all you know, after they left the Holy Spirit started convicting them about how they responded. Unless of course they were merely "professing" Christians who think they are saved because they parrot religious themes and have not truly come to Jesus as their Lord and Savior and received the Holy Spirit.. . Then they may have gone on their way mentally patting themselves on the back as they compared themselves to you in an uncharitable manner as they blithely head for that dreaded day when Jesus will tell them "I never kew you! Depart from me you workers of iniquity."

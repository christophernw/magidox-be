sometime we are poor too... My friends and i rarely eat places that we have to leave a tip just cuz we cant afford it and when we do scratch up enough money to get something, we have to add on even more money for a tip. Don't get me wrong, I always do tip and tip well but my point is sometimes we just don't have that much money. Its not that we dont feel for you, we just dont have much money.

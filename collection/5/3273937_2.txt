Quixtar is a multi-level marketing company, founded September 1, 1999 by Alticor, Inc., which also owns Amway. While Access Business Group (also owned by Alticor, Inc.) took over the Amway infrastructure in North America, Quixtar still services "Independent Business Owners" (or IBOs) operating in the Amway business model in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean, completely replacing Amway in 2001 as the marketing venture for products such as Nutrilite vitamins, XS Energy Drinks and Artistry cosmetics in those North American regions.

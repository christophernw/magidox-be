Aside from the sub-zero temperatures and thin air, consider this scenario.. . The first person to successfully strap-on his parachute runs to the nearest exit and pops the hatch.. . Everyone else, who is no longer wearing a seatbelt because they are reaching under their seat for a parachute, gets sucked out of the airplane when the hatch opens and the cabin decompresses.. . One survivor.  Several hundred splats.  Many on the ground may be killed by the several hundred splats.. . Better to have everyone ride things out in the tin can.

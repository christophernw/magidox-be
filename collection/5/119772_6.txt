Don't think that the government puts that high on a priority list any more than the think paying the people who live there a living wage.  They can make more in an hour in the US than they can make a day in Mexico.  That is why they come here illegally (which I don't approve of) and send the money they make back to their families in Mexico.  My question is how does that effect OUR economy.  There are some rescue groups in Mexico but not enough.

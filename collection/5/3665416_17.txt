because the act of sex took place in the garden of Eden after the whole apple bit and before adam/eve were forced out.  they had knowledge of carnal desires and enjoyment, but they didn't have any kids during this time.  therefore sex is fun, having kids isn't.. . this is all based on the Miltonic interpretation of the bible.

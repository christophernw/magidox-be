You are in a envelope of moveing air. The air and space around you is moveing too. So when you jump you are actually moveing sideways at the same speed as the air around you, and earth is spinning below you.  So you land in the same spot.  Kinda the same reason a fly buzzing around inside your car don't get splatted to the back window, The way it would if it were outside in the path of your car.

To be "Polite and Respectful" of your Doctor!! He or She is a very busy Professional, and you are not the only "Patient" that He/She has to see for that day!. Besides, if you don't care about your own Health, by giving your Doctor your complete and undivided attention, why should they do the same for you? Your Doctor is "A Human Being" the same as you, and they know that if you don't want to be "Treated, and Cared For" by them or any other Professional, then it is a waste of their time, and experience as well as "Medical Resources!" Our "Care and Treatment" begins with us!! No Doctor can HELP us, if We don't Help ourselves! We have to HELP Them Help Us! . Where did my Generation go wrong, with you children?? Does your generation really think that Mommy was Right; When She said; You're so special, and you are all that matter? Be Thankful, that your Doctor will see you, and treat you! They don't have to accept you as their Patient, for any reason..... There are Patients who want to be "Treated and Cared" for, that will "Respect" The Doctor and His/Her staff, that can't be seen, because of patients like you who are so ignorant and ill-mannered that waste too much time.. I know from experience; I see it on a regular basis, when I visit my Doctors every month! . Also, be in your Doctors office 30-45Min. before your appointment time, in case you have to fill out more paperwork, so you do not push your app't. time back and delay the rest of us, as well!!. It is called; "RESPECT" to all of us, we think that if we have to follow certain "Rules and Guidelines" then you should too!!

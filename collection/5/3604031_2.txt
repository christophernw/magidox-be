Yes, down here in NZ we get the southern lights.   The aurora are similar to a neon tube; electric current passing through a very thin gas.   The current is charged particles (protons and electrons from the Sun) entering the Earth's atmosphere.   The air starts to glow at a height of about 100 km, where it is about a millionth of sea level pressure.   You only see the aurora fairly close to the north and south magnetic poles because the shape of the Earth's magnetic field funnels the charged particles to those two locations.   So the Earth's magnetic field plays an important role in shielding most of us from incoming radiation.

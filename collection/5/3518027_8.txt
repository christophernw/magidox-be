I don't believe he's rooted in Satan at all.. . Santa Clause is based on a poem about a man named Nicholas (Or saint Nick if you want) who gave a bunch of gifts to a couple of orphanages to celebrate the ultimate gift of all: Jesus Christ.. . He has become somewhat commercialized, though. Why? People no longer find it "convenient" to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. This should be stopped. What's wrong with Christians celebrating Jesus!?

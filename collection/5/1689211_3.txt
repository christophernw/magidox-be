I had the same problem with a big toe.First of all,always dry your feet completely before putting on socks/shoes.Moisture can hold Bacteria in and cause infections.Never walk outside without some type of shoes on.Don't share socks/shoes with anyone.. I went to the doctor with mine and he gave me an anti fungus polish you coat the nail with ..cost a fortune!! didn't work.. I soaked my foot in a mixture of warm water and peroxide every day for a week and it took it away.....

I'm a Christian, and I go to a non-denominational church. These churches vary just as widely as any other denomination, but the basic concept is to avoid legalism (please see the link for exactly what that is).. .  We follow the Bible, and have cores beliefs similar to Catholics (Trinity, Jesus is the Son of God, etc.).. . There are, however, many differences. We do not believe in purgatory, praying to Mary or saints, confessing to priests in order to be forgiven, "ranking" sins (mortal sins and so on), and we do not believe that Mary was a virgin her entire life - only until Jesus was born. There's more differences, but those are some of the main ones.

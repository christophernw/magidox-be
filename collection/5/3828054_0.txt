Answer of vikram is correct, but, insted of the phrase `Ddensity increases' the phrase `density decreases' is suitable.As density of ice is less than that of water, it floates.Anomalous expansion of water is considered as the `boon of nature'. If the nature has not gifted this property to water, ice goes on settling in the bottom of the sea.Light and heat of the sun does not reach the bottom of the sea hence it does not melt. By this we can easily understand that no aquatic animal at the bottem of the sea can survive.

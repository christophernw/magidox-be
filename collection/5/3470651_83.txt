Good thing its always humid where im at. I have never experienced anything of the sort most of you had gone through and i certainly wont touch anything 'Mental', (like what Magiwol said), to get rid of static.. . Anyway, it will take a while for static to get discharged from your body. Like what they said, those dryer things can help, but what if theres none around?. . You could cover your hands with a hanky or part of your shirt, while opening a car door or a door knob or whatever metal you would like to get your hands on. Anything that does not conduct electricity will do.. . If you still get shocked then, what are you?

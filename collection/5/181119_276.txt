The absolute best (and possibly only) summer job I've ever had would be the construction job I took last summer. Not only did I get to hang out with a great group of people, but I also had an opportunity to get a good work-out while getting paid. If you have an opportunity to go into construction for a summer, I would say go for it. It usually pays well (far better than the majority of retail jobs) and it keeps you quite active.

Oh man, I love Y! Answers!  Even though there are so many people wasting time on these forums, I actually find that you can get answers to questions you would otherwise not be able to find the answer to on a search engine or something of that sort.  These are real people looking to answers your questions, no matter how dumb either of you are!. . Incidentally, before I ask a question on Y! Answers, I like to search through the questions.  Unless it is very specific (which at times means no one will be able to answer it anyway)  you can usually find a person who had a similar problem and has asked the same question before, so you don't have to wait and hope for people to give you the correct answer.. . So yes, it rocks.. Giro

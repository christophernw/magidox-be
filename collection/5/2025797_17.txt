QUOTE. Whiskers. Whiskers are the stiff hairs on the dog's face. They occur in clusters and serve as sensory structures â€” anything brushing against these whiskers stimulates Rusty to close his eyes, pull away, turn his head, paw his face, or shake his head.. . Some exhibitors trim the whiskers of their show dogs, but such trimming may limit the dog's response to his environment and detracts from the natural appearance of the pet.

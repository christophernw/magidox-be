you need to find out WHAT makes you man feel appreciated.  Everyone is different,  Some feel appreciated/loved by gifts, some by service, others hearing it (words)affirmations, yet others through touching and finally some prefer quality time.. . Of course not everyone is 100% one or the other, some can be a little of each, but probably everyone will be more one than any of the others.. . Try something that hits all 5 and you will for sure hit the jackpot.

Eggs are actually a pagan symbol used at Ostara which is the celebration of the Spring of Vernal Equinox.  Ostara (kinda sounds like Easter, huh?) is a celebration of earth's (or the Goddess') rebirth as Winter ends and Spring brings new life.  Eggs have been used as a symbol of new life for this holiday long before the Christian Easter, but like so many other Pagan rites it has been adopted into Christian ideology.

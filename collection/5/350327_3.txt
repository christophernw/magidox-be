Root beer is a fermented beverage made from a combination of vanilla, cherry tree bark, licorice root, sarsaparilla root, sassafras root bark (which is mildly carcinogenic), nutmeg, anise, and molasses among other ingredients. Many local brands of root beer exist, and homemade root beer is made from concentrate or (rarely) from actual roots. Like alcoholic beer, root beer has a thick and foamy head when poured.

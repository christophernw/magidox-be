It helps bring awarness to consumers about your business and creates a high possibilty of them becoming your clients.  Flyers are an inexpensive way of doing things, but even if you have a small budget, you might want to consider going with pushcards, mailing pieces, etc.   I'm a freelancing graphic designer, so if you need any help designing a piece, business cards, etc. just send me an email an i'll be more than glad to help you out! good luck

Santeria .is worshipping the catholic saints and expecting them to do something for you.  Sometimes maybe putting curses on others.  Brujaria is any form of witchcraft and includes santeria.  There are demonic spirits that do things that seem powerful to us, but they use us to keep us away from God.  . Your personal problem is either the work of the demonic spirits from the people visiting you, or that you yourself may have a spirit.  The only defense that we have is when we are Christians and filled with the Holy Spirit of God.  Anyway those visiting you definitely have spirits and I would personally stay away from them, but you need to decide whether you will recieve Christ or not and move on from there.  . I have counciled people that just didn't want to be Christians, and have put up with demon spirits in their lives for years.  They go to doctors and take meds to calm them down, but they stay the same.  When we pray for them by laying on hands they are fine for about 2 to 3 months and then the spirits return.  . Jesus is the answer to this problem.

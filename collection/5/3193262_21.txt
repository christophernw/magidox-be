Well I myself is very popular at my school. There a lot methods to be popular or should I say kinds.  First, if your a guy you have to be a total jock and have a great body, which the ladies love and guys wanna be like you. Second, if your a girl you have to be perfect all the time, you have to look and be clean, smell good, and beautiful; you also have to be prom queen or cheerleader. Some other options is you just have to look cool, one thing is that you must also have designer clothes and shoes, you gotta keep up the latest fshion trend and style. You have to wear what cool kids wear. Got it.

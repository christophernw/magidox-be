I HAVE NO REAL GOOD REASON TO LEARN A SECOND LANGUAGE THOUGH I KNOW SOME SPANISH.  OUR NATIVE LANGUAGE IS ENGLISH ANYWAY SO I FEEL IT'S A PRIMARY NOT A SECONDARY LANGUAGE.  IF I WENT OVERSEAS SOMEWHERE FOR LONG TIME I WOULD BE HAPPY TO LEARN ANOTHER LANGUAGE AND I FEEL FOREIGNERS COMING OVER HERE SHOULD LEARN OURS.  THE TRUTH IS THAT FOREIGNERS DON'T TRY TO ADAPT TO OUR CULTURE.

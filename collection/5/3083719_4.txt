Unless you are a medical doctor, you need to STOP right now--otherwise you are practicing medicine without a license which is illegal. Bipolar disorder is not the only diagnosis that Risperdal is used for. If this person doesn't feel comfortable taking it, then she should talk with her doctor about it and make the decision as to how to proceed. Frankly, I am appalled to read your question here.

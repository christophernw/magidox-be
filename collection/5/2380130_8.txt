Is this for real??!?!? No you shouldn't have been fired. If this wasn't a chronic condition, and it was just a one time thing, then I'd say no. I have to laugh, not at the fact you got fired, but how you meticulously descriped your ''shart''. I've never heard that word before. Too funny! But seriously, I pray you get another job soon. God bless.

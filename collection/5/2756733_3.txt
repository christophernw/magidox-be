Sounds like your transmission to me. If it was the timing belt the vehicle would not restart.. . You say you could only rev the engine up I assume you had it in drive and it didn't do anything. That tells me that the clutch pack was slipping. In L gear when you were doing 20mph was that 20 mph no matter how far you pushed the gas pedal?

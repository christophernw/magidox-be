I too have had these ugly little skin problems.Isn't it a pain.Because mine is hormonal, its on going.However, I found Aloette Flawless.Two steps of 1.lotion and 2.microdermabrasion.It takes about a week to see great results.It is advised to keep complexions clear to drink  all your required water.It is expensive,but to work and find relief I paid $60.00 for a double kit.It works well with retin a .05%! Great for pore reduction. It is labeled to be a Skin Sebum Perfection Serum.I wish you all the luck ,nothing is as frustrating as skin issues .It is  so hard on a persons confidence.

I agree with the last guy.  Ghetto is not a color, it is a statement about wealth, or lack of as the case may be.  Sadly, thanks in part to the media (not just though who have lighter skin in the media, but though with darker skin too), though with darker skin are associated with poverty.  It is an untrue statement and just a tool to keep certain groups in power.

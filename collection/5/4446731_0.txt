i know, it is strange...my sister who works out, power walks and watches very closely what she eats has always struggled with her weight...me i have been able to eat what ever i want, i do pilates twice a week and power walk at least once and have always been on the thin side never gaining more than 5 lbs or so and i can tell you i can really pack it away. some of my dates have been amazed at how much i can eat, they always think they are going to get off cheap at dinner !  i feel so bad for ppl who do struggle because others just don't realize how difficult it is for them especially when they try so hard just to eat normal and still can't lose.i've been there when ppl make fun of my sis and i know personally how hard she tries and it makes me very angry.  i feel fortunate i am the way i am but who knows when i'm 30 or 40 or whatever that may change...its too bad ppl can't look past the outward appearance but i guess thats just life and men in particular are such visually stimulated creatures that they affected by it most. i saw this one guy win that nathan's hot dog competition, he had to weigh no more than 120 and i think he ate over 50 hot dogs, even i would have been throwing up after that...maybe thats their secret they throw up afterwards.

G'day Balaam's Donkey,. . Thank you for your question.. . The fact of the matter is that Kerry made a gaffe. He voted to send troops in harms way in 2002 and he should not have made such a stupid comment. I'm sure that he wishes he hadn't said it.. . Irrespective of whether it was the right decision to send troops into Iraq, vital interests in the war on terror are at stake. It would be a huge victory for terrorism and its sponsors if they were to capture Iraq or to spark a civil war there. It would be a huge defeat for America and western democracy which we would all pay the cost for many years to come. Imagine having Al-Quida with oil revenue as the worst outcome. Iraq is a central battle in the war on terror. We cannot afford to lose there.. . Regards

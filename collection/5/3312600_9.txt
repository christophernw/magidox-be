1) Shoot out a eletromagnetic pulse of known duration and frequency.. . 2) Time how long it takes to return to the antenna, and how much of it is reflected.. . 3) Turn the antenna a bit, and repeat.  . . . The longer it takes, the farther away it was.. The stronger the returned signal, the more reflective it was.. . Different frequencies will reflect differently off various objects, which allows you to be specific about what you'lre looking for when you build the radar.. . Larger antennas will be more accurate.  So will stronger transmissions.

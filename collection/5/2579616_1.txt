Contrary to the previous answer, ethanol does not disrupt the H-bonds between strands of the double helix.  I am going to quote from a page about ethanol precipitation (see the referenced link):. Q: What is the role of ethanol in precipitating DNA from aqueous solutions?. A: The purpose of adding salts is to neutralize the charge on the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, but ethanol's task is a little more complex than "removing" the water. For a precipitation, you're interested in forming ion pairs between the polyanion (DNA) and the cation (Na+, Mg++, spermidine, protamine, etc). In dilute aqueous solution, DNA and counterions like Na+ and Mg++ are more or less in the free ion form rather than the ion pair form (that is, they are surrounded by one or more layers of water molecules).. . Water has a high dielectric constant (e), which from Coulomb's Law tells us that the electrostatic force (F) between two ions of opposite charge is very low in water:. . F = (Q1 * Q2)/(e * r2). . where Q is the charge on each ion and r is the distance between them. Adding organic solvent *decreases* the dielectric constant of the solution. As e goes down, F goes up and *BANG*, anion and cation form an ion pair and promptly swoon out of solution.

As filthy as those car pedals get and you want to put you little bare footies on them??Yuck!Sounds pretty gross to me. . . You could always get a pair of lightweight ballet slippers for driving.You'll still "feel" the pedal and you'll be wearing some protection on your feet if you have to get out and walk somewhere where there might be broken glass, rusty nails and moose poop on the road. Try to avoid wearing those flip-flops which are just clunky and unsafe for anything, in my opinion.. . Happy Motoring!

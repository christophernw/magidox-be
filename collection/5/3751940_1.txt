tell your friends about God's love.  tell strangers "God Loves You."  use your enthusiasm to spread the word.. . make signs and hang them on the bulletin boards at schools or in pizza parlors or the library or the grocery store.  you could make someone's day if they are looking for a car or babysitter and they find out God loves them!  you might like to ask permission first from the person who owns the BB.. . make a website for free at Geocities or tripod or someplace and show the world how God loves them every day.  Sunsets and rain, and clouds, and trees, and kids laughing, and people singing, and birds flying, and all the other things in our world that are Gifts from God!. . good luck!  you've already done a great thing!

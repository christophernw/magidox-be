Cats eyes are those little reflector things on the road that shine in different colours when your car headlights shine on them.. They work by totally internally reflecting the light rays from your car's headlights back at you, so that you can see what lane you're in on the motorway.. . Human eyes do not reflect light; they absorb it, specifically focusing it on a point on the retina with the highest density of rods and cones so that the information can be sent via the optic nerve to the brain where it can be processed.. . :)

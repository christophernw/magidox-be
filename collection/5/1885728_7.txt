I guess the first question that needs to be answered is: "Are you?". . If you are a "fat ugly toothless bitch who smells like rags" then I'd bet my bottom dollar that ALL of those guys who love the smell of rags will be pounding down your door to go out with you.. . No need to try out for the exotic dancer job and give away too many details before the first date.  Just take out a personal ad in the Guys-who-like-the-smell-of-Rags magazine and you should be able to tell the good looking guys by the nicknames they give themselves, or by the nicknames that they give to certain parts of their anatomy.. . And try not to be too embarrassed by all the attention you get at work.  Embrace the limelight.  Some folks go completely unnoticed all of their lives.. . Who's rags do you smell like anyway?  I might be interested.  I spell my name Danger.  That's Nick Danger, Third Eye.

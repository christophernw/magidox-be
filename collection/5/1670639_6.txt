I certainly do! The Bible speaks of three truths. It says the "Bible is truth" from Genesis to Revelation (John 17:17). The Bible also says that "Jesus is truth" (John 14:6). The Bible says again that the "Law is truth" (Psalm 119:143). Related verses are: (1John 2:4; 4:6). The Law is in Exodus 20:1-17.

It depends on why and when you are getting them. If your female and get them slightly before or during your monthly its most likely hormonal. Taking a herb called "chaste tree" can fix this (dont worry it comes in tablet form). Also if you feel a migraine coming on a strong shot of coffee can sometimes stop it coming on, as it acts as a vasoconstrictor and stops the throbbing/spasming blood vessels problem. But you have to get in early.

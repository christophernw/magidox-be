Electricity always existed in one form or another. However it was discovered by different people in different places and it was given different names.. . Around 600 B.C. it was first discovered as static electricity but was given different names as it was produced by rubbing ebony againgst another material. Thus it was discovered that some kind of like and unlike charges existed. Later on cells or batteries were made and electricity, flow of current etc. was discovered again.. . Much later Benjamin Franklin also discovered that the same kind of electricty existed in the clouds when he flew a kite high into the sky among the cloud with key attached to the string and the electricity travelled down towards him.

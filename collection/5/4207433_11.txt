Not all Atheists are 'idiots' as you would say. We don't believe in any 'gods.' We choose our own path. We do not believe in the teachings of the Bible. We do not believe in the ways or the culture. Not all of us are self-centered and think we're sooooo smart. . . I've done my research and yet, they have no proof of anything.. . And btw, YOU'RE the idiot. You're the one complaining about people.

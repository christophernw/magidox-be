I think it is a pyramid scheme and it should be illegal. My brother has been doing this business for twenty years and dropped thousands upon thousands into those crazy"how to build your business tapes" and he only makes a few thousand a month. He claims it's residual income, but I see him working 3 times harder than a real job. If he would have put all that money into a retirement account, he would be retired by now sippin Lattes on the beach.......

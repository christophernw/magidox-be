For anyone that ascribes to Darwin's origin of the species theory (where there is no God who could call all things seen and unseen into exsitence with the command of his Word), war should not be a problem, because there is no finite moral standard... it is survival of the fittest.  Eat... or be eaten, Kill or be killed.. For those who have a life-trusting faith in God, it is sometimes harder to decide, since we are past those times when God tells his people to go and eliminate this group or that "so that you may have the land that I have promised you.". In current times we need to be loyal to our friends who call for aid.  We may sometimes need to step out and rescue a people from an unbelievably oppressive governmental hardship, particularly when that government gives all the signs that it not only materially supports terrorism but that it will conduct unprovoked war on other peaceful nations.

I believe this is about people that are a bit hateful, or so it seems to me. I've heard people talk like this, and the dumb thing is, they think they'll be the ones still living while most of the world has died. I heard one guy say, less people is better, like he would be glad if so many other people died. Pretty petty, if you ask me.

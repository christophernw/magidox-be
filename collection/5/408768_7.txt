Not all theist try to lead you to "salivation"When you say theist,you are referring to everyone that believes in God or gods.Everyone who believes in God are not all Christians.I am also a theist,but I don't believe that if you don't accept a phony messiah, you are going to hell.That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard from my family and society.Christians strongly believe that if you don't accept Jesus as your personal savior, you will go to hell and they feel that it is their duty to tell you "the good news".. . When they attempt to tell you their truth,why don't you tell them your truth.Why don't you tell them that they don't have to be a slave to a belief system that was forced on previous generations by land invaders/slave owners/murderers to be free.

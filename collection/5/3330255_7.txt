me and a friend were just discussing that.its sensationalism just like a rumor about a public figure.no one cares about politics unitl theres some dirt whether true or not. the bible has been attacked for years and still stands.Jesus said it was an evil generation that looked for signs and wonders.people just want to believe theres more to it than theyve gotten.how juicy is that,God came down here and fell in love with a woman!the truth is so beautiful though.God came down here because he was in love with me.its our job as christians to make the truth louder than the lie.were up against hollywood now.

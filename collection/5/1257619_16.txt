Because they want to share their beliefs with you with the best intentions and out of love. That, of course, is not always true, as people are individuals, but if following their beliefs closely, their attitude will be one of friendliness, peace, and lack of judgement. If you do not want to talk to them, simply tell them so. If you do not want them to knock again, you can either tell them to not come to your house again or you can post a "no soliciting" sign. Remember that all people have feelings and beliefs, and there is no reason to slam a door or be rude. You can be firm, but please don't be disrespectful.

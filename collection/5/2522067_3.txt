Like you said, true evil- terrorists, murders, child molesters and rapists- are just "misunderstood" as liberals say. They have a theory that nothing is anyone's fault, and yet everything is someone else's fault. Doesn't make sense does it?. . Ignore them, they lost the ability to win the presidency and are spinning farther and farther away from the mainstream.

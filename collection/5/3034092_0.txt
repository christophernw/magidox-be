The use of depleted uranium is NOT the use of "low yield nuclear weapons!"  This comparison is simply invalid.. Depleted uranium is used as is it is extremely dense, simple physics explains the use of a heavy item causes more damage than a light item as a projectile.. Nuclear weapons take advantage of the instability of certain isotopes and their ability to release great amounts of energy.. No valid comparison between the methods of use!

Buddhism believed meditation is good for both mind and body. 10 minutes of meditation is the equivalent amount of time to 8 hours of sleeping, or that`s what most people believe.. .    Meditation is to think or reflect on anything in a calm or deliberate manner. Think of only the good and not bad. Engage in devotional contemplation, especially prayer. You train your body, calm yourself, or empty your mind, often by achieving an altered state, as by focusing on a simple object.

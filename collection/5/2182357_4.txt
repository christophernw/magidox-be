I don't see what it could hurt.  I mean, he have holidays for pretty much everything else...lol!  The only potential problem (I can think of) would be that people may say "Hey...it's a holiday!" and go up to their cabins or something.  . . But honestly, it's not that hard to vote.  I mean, it's not like the polls are only open for 3 or 4 hours.  You can vote by mail, send in an absentee ballot, etc... If people care enough (which they should, because it affects every individual), they will find the time...

It's not IMMIGRANTS we want to get rid of -- it is ILLEGAL immigrants.  These are people who take advantage of our government and system and all it has to offer, but do not pay taxes.  The kids are educated for free, receive free lunch, the families get medical care and othe benefits.  Immigrants don't bug me in the least, but if you want to live in this country become a part of it legally.

well sid, one of the things that has succeeded in making parle-g a household brand is it's simplicity and the cute kid on the cover. however, if you must change this tradition, retain the colorful mix of bright colors and go in for a kid preferably as the brand ambassador. you could focus on the nutrients it provides and position it as a health necessity. good luck !

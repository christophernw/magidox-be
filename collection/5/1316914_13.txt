Humans are not naturally self destructive, humans are just not competent enough to understand what they are doing if you get them into large groups. Honestly I have noticed people don't do such retarded things when they are alone, but when you put them together everyone decides to do what they think everyone else is thinking and as a general rule this is a bad idea. Basically what I am trying to get at is that we are a world of followers with no real leaders.

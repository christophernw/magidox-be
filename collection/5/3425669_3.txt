Well it would seem that he wants to mend some fences,and of course why shouldn't he visit Turkey,it's not a theocracy so maybe there are some Catholics there that might want one chance to have the pope visit them. And of course everything he said about Mohammed and Islam the Islamic world is going out of its way to prove true,as for me I could care less about the Pope and his wanderings. Part of me wishes some nut job Muslim would off him so they could stir up enough prejudice and hatred between these groups to finally cause them to just get it on until their truly done fighting forever,or until they're all gone so the rest of the world didn't have to deal with this crap anymore.. .

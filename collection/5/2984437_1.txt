When I cutted back on soda and sweets that time so long ago, I replaced them with water, 100% fruit juice, and actual fruits. Don't forget: fruits have sugar in them, too, and all it takes is getting some use to.. . My dad has all the problems when someone eats too much sugar and for too long, but when he married by mom, the dubious health nut, she basically taught him the wholesome goodness of fruits. Now, the lesson is passed down to me, and we're a fruits-lovin' family.. . Good luck!

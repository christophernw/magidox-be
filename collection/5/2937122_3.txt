There may be some reasons for this:. . 1) You may be overtraining.  If you don't give yourself time to recuperate you'll never exceed your previous workouts.  You'll gain speed / fitness during your rest periods.. . 2) You aren't eating enough... perhaps. Make you sure you are properly fueled.  5 miles requires proper nutrition. If you've cut your carbs or are doing the Atkins dance, stop!  Running requires food / energy.. . 3) Humidity -- as summer approaches and the heat gets worse, expect your performances to decline.  I always lose a little bit of time on my runs during the summer because of the heat.. . 4) Going through a funk.  It happens.  I can run a 20:06 5K one weekend and two weeks later hit 21:15.  It happens.  . . Good luck.

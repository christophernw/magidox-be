some people will tell you to picture your audience nude. this can be more a problem than a solution. instead, choose your words carefully, make sure your audience will get the same mental picture that you are trying to convey. then as you speak, watch your audience. facial gestures will tell you if they agree, disagree, understand, or are confused. then you must choose how to rephrase your statment so that they will get what you are trying to say.  the most important part of speaking is knowing your audience. Who are they? what do they already think about the topic you are speaking of?

I know that in Canada, you can do what is known as a common man's copyright, which will stand up in any court. You simply send a copy of your manuscript to yourself through REGISTERED mail. This requires you to sign for it, and requires the post office - a government agency - to stamp or witness the assured delivery. This puts a date stamp on your sealed envelope (ask the post worker to stamp over the seals) and voila - Proof that it's yours :) Hope this helps you in the UK.

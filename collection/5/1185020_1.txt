U.N peacekeeping is not a good job. You will basically be under U.N umbrella and not by the rules of your native country, and the U.N is managed by people who have no military experience at all, and is very corrupt and deploy you places they have very little information and waste your life in there, remember Somalia?, (Very good example) U.N mission failed in Somalia, because the mission has never been planed well.

Who said you can't get what you want? If you really want something, you will be ready to pay the price to get it, or to deal with the consequences in order to get it or to make any sacrifice to get it.. You can have anything, just compromise yourself, setup a strategy, be patience, get advices from those whom got what you want, be discipline about get it, don't give up and don't listen to those that tells you can't have it. (maybe THEY can't).

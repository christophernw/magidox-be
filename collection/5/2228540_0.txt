Because Clinton overcut the military budgets when he became president. He used the end of the 'cold war' as an excuse, but his real reasoning is he has always had a personal vendetta against the military. They were grossly underfunded for eight years, and those nice little amenities like body armor and guns that don't jam take mucho cashy money- money the government has only in the last 4 years or so actually begun delivering, and that has been somewhat squandered, to a degree, by the civilian powers-that-barely-be at the Pentagon (which means that Bush is also responsible, to a degree, because he either appointed these morons, or appointed the people who hired these morons).

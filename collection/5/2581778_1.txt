You either use your checking account or a credit card.  Unless you want to contact a credit card company like Capital One who offer No Hassle & Protection & ask them if they can give you a credit card with a low credit line & then you have peace of mind.  I use Capital One instead of my other cards & its worked for me just fine.  Otherwise, there's no other choice.

The headaches and the shakes may indicate a very low sugar.  That would be anything below 60 and is termed hypoglycemia.  Hypoglycemia can be dangerous and I guess the doctor wants to know how low your sugars go.. . The high numbers you mention are normal after you eat.  The way diabetes is diagnosed is this:  You fast for 8 hours and check your sugar.  You do that on two occasions.  If on both occasions your sugar is above 126, you have met the definition of diabetes.  It is normal for blood glucose to go upto 200 after eating, especially after eating large amounts of sugar.  If you worry about diabetes, talk to your doctor to perform the formal test describe above (there are other tests like drinking sugar water and measuring if the blood sugar goes over 200..that is called glucose challenge test but the fasting blood sugar test is done first).  Hope that helps.

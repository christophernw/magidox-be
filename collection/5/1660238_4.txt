I looked up July 3, 2006 ateroid and couldn't really find anything under that, but I did see one thing and it kept refering to the asteroid's name as '2004 XP14'. When I looked up '2004 XP14' I found alot of stuff. . . . Here's some links:. http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13556129/. http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~rhill/alpo/minplan/flyby.html. http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~rhill/alpo/minplan/2004XP14.htm. http://news.yahoo.com/s/space/20060626/sc_space/hugeasteroidtoflypastearthjuly3. http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2006-06-27-asteroid-encounter_x.htm?csp=34. . . Here's the link to my search results:. http://search.yahoo.com/search?fr=ytff1-&p=2004%20XP14&ei=UTF-8. . . Thank you very much for asking this question. Until I read it I didn't even know anything about an asteroid coming so close to Earth on July 3rd. I learned something new from looking it up! Thank you.

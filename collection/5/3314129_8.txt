You have to train your mind to "be quiet". Turn it off. Think of somethig relaxing or use one of those relaxation sound machines. It is a mental exercise to learn to clear your mind. You don't want any distractions when you are doing this. NO tv or radio. Make sure you are comfortable physically as well when you try to go to bed. If all of this persists then try a sleep aid. You can get some natural remedies at a health food store.

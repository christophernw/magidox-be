if you listen to the back on the bag your dog is going to go running around looking for food tearing up garbage. I have a lab I keep a 3 gallon bucket full all the time and he is normal weight. Food doesn't matter until their seniors its exercise that counts. Hip dysplasia is most common in German Shepperd's, Labs commonly get arthritis.

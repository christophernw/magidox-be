Put a pot of water with a little salt in it on the boil on the stove.  Grab a metal or plastic sieve/coriander, put the broccoli in it, pop it on top of the boiling water and let the steam from the water steam it.  The colour will brighten and get more vivid (shouldn't take more than a few minutes).  If you want to hurry it up, you can cover the coriander with a lid, which will trap the steam in, but watch out or the broccoli will get soggy.  When it's done, just pull it off and eat it!  Yum!

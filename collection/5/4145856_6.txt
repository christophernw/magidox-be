You need to get some knowledge-on the word immigrant. And what makes one..  If your meaning is Ancestors that is different-than everyone in the world is-except Adam and Eve . And we all came from Africa, (which is where by the rivers they think man  began). Now any one can pick on the meaning of the word. But in most reasonable terms if you were born somewhere and still live there your not an immigrant. And most live by the reasonable meaning. Unless they want to be unreasonable!. .  You know why Mexicans people are noticed-common sense-because of the mass amount of people coming in not in an orderly way. Its has caused a strained on our economy. (schools, health, programs, insurance,crime and all that) Rather it was intended or not--its the results..  Open your eyes. Maybe there is hope for you.

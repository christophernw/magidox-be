That isn't always the case. On the Pacific Coast (California, Oregon, and Washington) there are cold currents so the beach is colder than the land. On the Gulf Coast and the Atlantic Coast (Texas, Luisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Deleware) The Gulf of Mexico (which has many warm currents) or the Gulf Stream (the warm water coming from the Gulf of Mexico that passes by the mainland U.S. turning twards Europe after Deleware) Causes the Beach to be warmer than about 20 miles inland. I live in Charleston, SC and can relate to this.

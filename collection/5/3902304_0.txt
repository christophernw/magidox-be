The answer has to do with two facts.  One, the shape of a RBC affects its ability to transport oxygen and CO2.  And two, the plasma solute level affects the shape of the RBC.. . If solute levels are too high in the plasma, the plasma would be hypertonic to the cytoplasm of the RBC.  According to diffusion, water would move from where its in higher concentration (i.e., INSIDE the cell) to where its in lower concentration, or INTO the plasma.  In this case, the RBC would shrink and its ability as a deliverer of nutrients and a transporter of wastes is greatly compromised.  (Incidentally, the diffusion of water is called osmosis.). . If the plasma solute level is too low, the plasma would be hypotonic to the cytoplasm of the RBC.  Water from the plasma would osmose INTO the cell causing it to swell or, in a severe case of low plasma concentration, would result in the lysis (or bursting) of the RBC.  In either case, the RBC can not perform its function.. . Hope this answer helps!  Good luck.

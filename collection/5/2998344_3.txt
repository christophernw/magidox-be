I just went to wkipedia and looked at this. It seems that there is debate as to whether the entire body experiences the blood rush associated with the blush or if it is only the face. In some ways it is related to the post orgasmic "flush" which is generally considered to be a full body blush. As for the why...... . I've always thought that it had something to do with the fight or flight response and that it also has to do in part with adreneline. Most people only blush when they are embarrased or involved in something that makes them uncomfortable. I would venture to say that this is fundementally related to the idea of fight or flight. It may be the emotional component of fight or flight that triggers the flush.

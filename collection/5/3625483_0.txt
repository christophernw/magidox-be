You come to the computer with a heavy question and ... you think you are going to get a decent answer from 95% of the people here??? Don't you realize that 95% of the people here are at most 15, have little or no life experience under their belt, and you want to hear advice from them??? I am not being a smart @$$...just honest. I seriously doubt that I would take my advice, let alone ask for it here.

Your dream career is something you LOVE doing and you get PAID for it. Many of us do things we love like hobbys, old cars, collecting, junk sales, arts, crafts and more. The problem is we do it for fun but we dont get paid for our time. If you can match the two you are on to something.. Example:. Someone who loves SPORTS can get a job as a coach, newpaper editorialist, author on sports games, odds maker, broadcasting, etc.. . Someone who loves Helping People: home health care aid, nurse, EMT, counselor, non-profit group, mental health etc.. . Someone who loves SALES:. car salesperson, RV salesperson, clothing, homes, boats, insurance, store, etc.. . Find what you love then look into what careers match your love and your strengths. Many colleges have assesment tests for this with the counselors. Check into it.

don't mind if i dont get 10 points. just wanna add:. . you must CONNECT with the people whom you are speaking to. You must be humane. Say out things that are playing in their minds. Joke. Eat humble pie. Then, get accepted that you are 'one of us (audience)'.. . Stage 2 will be where you build up ypur audience to the point you are getting to. You have to construct their thoughts towards your topic. You have to ask some very thought-provoking but somewheat direct questions.. . Stage 3 is where you reveal your actual thoughts or message.

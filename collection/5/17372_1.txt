If an AIDS virus were to be injected into the bloodstream it is my hypothesis it would take about two weeks to sweep throughout the bloodstream. The initial cells being penetrated by virus in 10-14 days. Amazingly, the remaining cells would rebound. Medical tests would reveal nothing wrong. After this a constant battle of breaking down and rebuilding of the immune system occurs. This battle can result in an immunity against the virus in my opinion. The other result which can occur is that of being vulnerable to opportunistic infections. The classic symptoms which can include  fever, sweats, cough, swollen glands etc. etc.  Everyone is different which is why there would be such a vast spectrum of symptoms and timetables for infection.

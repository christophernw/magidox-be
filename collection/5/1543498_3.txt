i basically agree with the other people on this one, but the way a character is dressed can definately inflict on the audience what kind of a personality the character has, for example on the show, seinfeild, the craziest guy is always dressed in a shirt, tie, pants, jacket, that does not "go" with anyting that else that he might be wearing.

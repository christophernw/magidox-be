I've bought hundreds of things online and never had a problem. The only thing you've got to watch out for is 'spyware' or similar worms that can sit in your computer, remember the numbers and passwords you type, and use it again. Get some decent antivirus to protect from this: adaware from Lavasoft & www.avast.com (both free) will do the trick.. Happy shopping!

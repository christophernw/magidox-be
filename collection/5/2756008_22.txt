First of all, Adam and Eve were the first people but Noah and his family were the only people to survive the flood. Noah had 3 sons who each went different ways. One went to Asia, one to Europe and one to Africa. These sons and their wives were the forefathers of the races we see today. it is obvious that people who live in siberia and the arctic would have pale skin and africans would have dark skin simply because of their time in the sun.

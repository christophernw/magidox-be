To truly help someone, you would teach them the truth. It is ultimately up to that person what they will do with that knowledge. But as a true follower of Christ, we would not want to bribe someone to come to the truth. The truth of everlasting life is all that is needed! If after hearing the truth, they reject it, or accept it, they do it truthfully. Jehovah God wants people to love him, and do his will with a willing heart, not because they will get something in return.. . While accurate knowledge is essential to faith in God, more is needed to move one to obey and to serve him. When asked what is the greatest commandment from God, Jesus said: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength.” (Mark 12:30) If a person loves God the way Jesus indicated, he will be most willing to obey and serve Him. Is that true of you?. . . loj

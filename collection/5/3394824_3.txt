Hmmmm...the mere fact that you're asking this question makes me wonder about you as an individual.. . I don't know about you, but the black people I know and allow in my circle are far from messed up. As a matter of fact, most have college degrees, good families, and almost all belong a church where they play an active role.. . I will graduate with a Ph.D. next summer....I have 10 brothers and sisters--half are college graduates while the other half are business owners. Our parents are both ministers and I feel like we grew up spending more time at church than at home...the Christian foundation I got as a child is what made me who I am today.. . I'm a Black American female...who has never smoked or had an ounce of alcohol in my life, and I'm way past the age of 30...

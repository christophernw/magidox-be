Where would be the fun in reducing the differences? A woman doesn't want to marry a man just like her, she wants to marry a man that compliments who she is & has strengths in the places where she has weakness. The question you should be asking is, How can communication be improoved between the opposite sexes. Someone whol interests you, challenges you to think outside you box & can make take a look at the world from another perspective is only achieved through these differences. Embrace them!

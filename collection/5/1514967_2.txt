it has a lot to do with the environment you were raised in...like just by what you said i would say that in your schooling somewhere they offered English Spanish Italian and french courses....now in no way am i saying they didn't offer anything else...i am also going to have to assume that you probably know English,obviously, and Spanish,just cause its most common where i reside, so languages such as french and Italian are more pleasing to your ear than lets say German or your example of Asian languages...plz let me know if I'm anywhere in the ball park

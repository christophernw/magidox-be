The old reason that people used to believe was about us all being stuck indoors or clustered together on public transport during the winter - however this does not make sense - who's boss lets them drag their desk outdoors in the summer months?  . . We use public transport the same amount in the summer as in the winter and stay in enclosed spaces for the same amount of time as well.  . . The real reason is the lack of sunlight on our skin.  The sunlight triggers the production of B vitamins which help our immune systems.  Lack of sunlight means less B vitamins means poorer immune response means more likely to suffer from any passing virus as opposed to fighting it off.  . . Of course people get summer colds but that is due to other factors.  By the way - a heavy cold is not the flu.  Influenza is a serious life-threatening illness and has different symptoms.  . . Take supplements, people!

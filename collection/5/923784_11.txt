It doesn't actually have much to do with potential energy - in my experience the cues are not usually raised in order to increase their kinetic energy.. . Although pool can demonstrate the conservation of energy and a player can benefit from knowledge of geometry, its best link, I think is its representation of chaos theory. That is every break, even if the white is hit with the same force will produce different results in the outcome - even vastly different results with only small variations (say in the position of the pool balls or even the pool table itself).

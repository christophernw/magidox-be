Why did you just stereotype most Christians as angry bigots?. . Actually the Bible says not to judge by outward appearances.... . But it does say to make the right judgment, to discern, and to correct, to rebuke, and to teach...in righteousness.... . So when we condemn sin, it is right and not discriminatory to do so.... so long as we remember that we to are sinners.... but we are saved by God's mercy and grace... Jesus Himself.... . And we likewise are to show mercy and grace and forgiveness and love to all.... even those that don't deserve it.. . . God bless you and yours.

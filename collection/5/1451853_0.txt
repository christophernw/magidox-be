There's a problem with your link -- correct one is below.. . The pope's suggestion not to study the origins was consistent with religion's position on science as long as the two have existed:  don't dig too deep.  And yes, the religious groups are afraid there will one day be "proof" that god doesn't exist, or that enough people will realize there's no need for god (we've already found that out, a long time ago) and they'll be scrambling to keep their believers.  Putting artificial limits on what we should or should not know always has been silly (and ineffective -- people are inquisitive, and are going to find out no matter what some religious leader says) -- that the church was still doing it so recently is patently absurd.

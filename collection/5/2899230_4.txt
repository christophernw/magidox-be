Sounds like he could have a problem with his swim bladder.  That's the organ that helps them orient themselves properly when they swim.  Sometimes fish, after struggling to keep upright, stay close to the bottom and slide along the rocks a bit to move.  Sometimes this will clear up on its own, but I'd do a quick net search to see if you can learn about possible treatment.

A standard cup measurement is 8 oz, a measuring cup.. . I recently got an 8 month old puppy and he was not being fed enough and was really skinny. The previous owners were feeding him the amount that the package said was right for a full grown dog of that weight. Not enough for a growing puppy! Puppies are SUPPOSED to gain weight as they grow!. . Look on the back of the bag, but make sure U are feeding puppy food and following the directions for a puppy and not the directions for a grown dog. He should be fed 3 times a day until 6 months of age. . . Don't be too rigid about the amounts. The amount he needs will also depend on his activity level, and he also needs to grow, so the amount he needs will go up with time until he stops growing.. . Another strategy is to let him eat as much as he wants to eat in a 10 minute period. Then pick up the bowl. He won't be able to overeat.

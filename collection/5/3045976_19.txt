First off peace would be boring. Instead of peace how about less deadly conflict? . . Second many of the problems of the world tend to boil down to lack of empathy for others. People so wrapped up in the me me me, even if it's externalized selfishness such as fanaticism that they run over others and feel justified in doing so. The dehumanization caused by real or percieved injustice of one's enemy is natural. Few people could kill a human, but a monster, yes they can put down a rabid monster. . . Some conflicts there are no right or wrong. Both sides have valid reasons for fighting and all the peace inititives in the world won't solve a thing. They have to slug it out until somebody wins or they realize it just aint worth it.

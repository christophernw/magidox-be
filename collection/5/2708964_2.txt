I don't think you've got a leg to stand on. Your clause says you will purchase subject to evaluation. You've done the evaluation and have decided to pull out. That clause protected you from being obliged to carry through the purchase regardless of the results of the evaluation. That's what's happened. You are not obliged to go through with the deal.. The clause said nothing about your being compensated if you decide to pull out.

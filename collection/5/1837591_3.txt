Many Deaf people do not believe that there is anything wrong with them. They embrace their deafness as it defines who they are. There is a whole Deaf community, and they are offended when people refer to them as "disabled", again, they don't see it as being a disability.  Society are the ones who put the label of "disability" on deafness, and thus offer pity & compensation for it. Especially when one is born deaf, there may be spiritual issues involved as well. They often feel that God intended them to be Deaf, and thus they are to remain Deaf. Very often it is the parent who makes the decision to proceed with cochlear implantation or not, and very often their viewpoint is passed down to the child. . . There is also the case that there are some deaf children for which a Cochlear Implant is not appropriate for various reasons.

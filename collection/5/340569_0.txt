Hi,,, look under the U.S. Govt, travel restrictions and requirements..  They have a list of countries that require a Visa to visit the U.S.... This is inclusive even if you have relatives in the States... .  Ever since 9-11,,,,, travel requirements have gotten tougher for people wanting to come here.. sorry,, but that is the reason why that their maybe a long delay.... . .  Good luck

Have to agree with responses here. My two little ones sleep on the bed with my partner and I, but at times they will bet too hot and hop down to snuggle up with our Springer who has his own mat on the floor.. . You could try putting a blanket of its own on the end of the bed, but why not set up a bed of its own beside you - that way it has the choice if he gets too hot or uncomfortable on the bed with you :)

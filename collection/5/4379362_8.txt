well sweet heart it could mean that you need a lot more water. Drink plenty of water for one whole day and see if it gets clearer. If not you may need to go to the doctor, cause it could be an infection. NOT A BAD ONE but like something natural for most women. But drink plenty of water and i'm more than sure it will get clear.

Its a build up of static electicity in your clothing and the fact that your car is isolated from earth by its rubber tyres.. . When you touch the ground the circuit is completed and you get a shock.. . In the UK you can get anti-static strips ( supposed to prevent car sickness ) which touch the road to discperse the static buildup.. . Another idea is to get your passenger to exit first :o))

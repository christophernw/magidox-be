Start by obtaining the descrption of the easement. Now research the history of what happened to why the easment was never implemented. . If you can prove that the purpose of the easement has been met in another way or that the easement will never be met because there is a conflict then possible you can petition or ask for a hearing of the local zoning committee to remove it.. . In my neighborhood, homes along the perimiter of the city must make way for a possibly highway, it hasn't been built yet, but the easement was set back in 1955.. . i.e. There was suppose to be allowance for a underground power cable which would allow for connection via your yard, but the development of the proposed property was changed from residential to industrial and an alternate power route was required.

Johnson's Publishing Company located in Chicago,IL is Black owned and operated.. Don Barden (A Black Man) is the owner of "The Majestic Star Casinos" (located in 4 states),and as a matter of fact, he was "Rich" enough to buy it from "Donald Trump" (a White man and a Millionaire).. . You've only been on Yahoo Answers for a "Hot Minute",and the first and only question you can think of to ask is something "Racist?". Go to bed,and get ready for school in the morning. History class starts at 9:00am!.. . (PS) Racist people like you are always the first to condem others,without looking for the facts. Because there are Black Millionaires all over the world,and some we don't even know about,how can you possibly say,that none of them are Incorporated?. You fail to realize,that most White Millionaires made their money,by lying and scheming to people who didn't know how to handle their business,(and you,my dear,would be one whom would fall into that catagory,simply because you don't know the facts!). Most Black Millionaires started from the dirt up!. (So) If you think,that Black Millionaires don't know how to handle their business,then send an email to "Donald",he can use all the help he can get. (And another thing!). I REALLY DON'T CARE IF YOU REPORT ME!. I won't loose any sleep over it. (Smile)

Many people feel that the fetus becomes a human life at the moment of conception, so therefore abortion is killing.   I am not in favor of abortion just to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy, but if the mothers life is in danger because of her pregnancy then it should be considered.   Or if a woman becomes pregnant due to rape or incest, she should have the option of abortion.

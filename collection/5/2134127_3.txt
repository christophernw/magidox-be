if you still have the box, or go on their website to see if there is a 1-800 number you can call. they may be able to replace it. .  .  your receipt is no good even if you find it. there is a 60 to 90 day time limit that allows you to return the coffee pot. so your best bet is to call the 1-800 number, maybe if you still have the warranty you could get a replacement with that. or you could shell out another $30-$50 for a new one. . .      coffee pots don't really seem to last at all. you buy it and one month later, it's broken/leaks. .            i bought my mom two coffee pots this past christmas, i knew if i got only one it wouldn't last that long. so i got two. (we went through four more since then)

Your pit-bull whines because you have exhibited that his whining will make you react in a certain way that gives him attention.As a pit-bull owner pit-bulls love attention, and activity, and even if it's just to get you up and walking around the house to follow you, they'll enjoy it. My best advice is to get your pit-bull on a normal schedule of eating, going outside, and playing and the whining will decrease and eventually cease.

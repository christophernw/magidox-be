Failing to realize that it's not the 60's, and Iraq isn't Vietnam.. . The misguided notion that Iraq (long time host of the first world trade center bombers, financier of terror in Israel, and the only country I know of that had a terrorist training camp with a real airplane fuselage for practicing hijacking) didn't pose a direct and immediate threat to the US.. . Pathological hatred of Texans.

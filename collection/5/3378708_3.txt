This is a great question.  It turns out that breast feeding actually reduces your chances of breast cancer, AND it's a method of contraception too, as you cannot menstuate during the breast feeding period.  So, although American women choose not to breast feed for some reason, it would actually serve in their best interests...and their babies...to do so.  They are still trying to figure out the mechanism relating breast-feeding and reducing the likelihood of getting breast cancer...hormonal (estrogen, progesterone etc).

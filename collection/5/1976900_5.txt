ok, the best place to go for that is south africa or tanzania.... they have huge parcs and great diversity of animals. South afrika on top of that is really advanced, so the chock won't be obvious.... they have beaches, and you can enjoy your exotic animals and stil have fun in the city... their clubs are excellent. But don't leave with the idea that Afrika is what you see on TV, if you are expecting that you'll be shocked. Another place will also be kenya, and you can go to the south of kenya and escalade the kilimanjaro. BUT DON"T EXPECT TO SEE HUGE FOREST LIKE ON TV, if that is the experience you want, then you have to go to Congo, but there is political instability... the choice is up to you ... but dont even think of going to west afrika, or east, or north... the diversity of animals resides in the south or center

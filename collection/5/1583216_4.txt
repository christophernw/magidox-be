First, put in cool water if u put in hot water there is a chance the egg may crack because of the change in temperature from the fridge to the sudden increase in temperature from the hot water. I really dont know if that salt trick really works because what salt actually does to boiling water is that it helps reach boiling point quicker i dont see how that would help the egg from cracking. : )

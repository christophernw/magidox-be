Lack of imagination. I've got a good question. If every part of your anatomy is made up of individual atoms, mainly carbon of course. Let's say you are able to separate one carbon atom from your body and you are left with a tiny hole. Does the hole get filled with another carbon from the atmosphere. Or, do the other carbons spread out to kind of fill it in. Is that why when we get old our skin gets paper thin, we simply running out of carbon atoms. I know we have cell regeneration, but every cell is made up of smaller atoms. Which is it spreading of atoms to fill in, or taking an loose atom from the environment?

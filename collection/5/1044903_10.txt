It's all in your approach.  From the sounds of it, the person that has cancer didn't want to tell his or her close friend that he or she is going to die with it soon.  My best suggestion is to ask the patient if he or she wants you to say anything to your mutual friend.  If the answer is yes, then take the friends' hand and sit down somewhere where it is quiet and slowly and carefully tell your friend what is happening to your mutual friend.  Don't be blunt about it yet at the same time don't sugar coat it either.. . However if the answer is no.  As much as it may hurt you, you have to respect the wishes of your friend and honor them.  . . Neither situations are pleasant and can be quite emotional by all parties involved.. . Good luck to you and I hope I was helpful.

The avowed purpose of the allegory is to give an image of the process of education at a point in the discussion when Socrates has just introduced, through what is known as the analogy of the line (Republic, VI, 509d-511e), the notion that the whole of being is made up of a visible and an intelligible "realm" (not "world").

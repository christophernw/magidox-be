I've had frog legs in Singapore before and they were like chicken wings. Nothing that special (wings have too little meat for the effort anyway). . . Many people like to show off that they eat this or that - I think that's the main reason.... I've had squid and octopus - both are like rubber (have you seen a squid?).

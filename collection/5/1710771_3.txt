Eggs are a traditional Easter gift, usually decorated. Easter was also a pre-Christian fertility celebration, and eggs are a symbol of fertility and new life.  The early Christians adapted this to the Christian belief that Christ brought new life (or eternal life)to the world. The chocolate eggs are a fairly recent development.  I think it started partly because most children and adults used to eat no chocolate or candy during Lent - the 40 days of fasting before Easter.  People would buy chocolate and candy to give to kids for Easter, so I assume some smart marketing person thought of making chocolate eggs as a way to combine the old tradition of giving eggs with the modern tradition of giving chocolate or candy. Today many children still give up candy and sweet things for Lent and donate the money they save (by not buying candy) to charity.

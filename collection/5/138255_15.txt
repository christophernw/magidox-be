As oil is used it gets hot and dirty. Over time, it loses it's ability to properly lubricate your engine and gets thick and sticky.  It you leave it too long, it''ll potentially ruin your engine.. . And without oil, your moving parts in your car will stop moving and lock, making your car a very large paperweight until you get a new engine or car :p

Twinkle (made up of 2 syllables, sounds like A and B when singing the ABC song), twinkle (sounds like the C and D in the ABC song), little (again has 2 syllables, making it sound like the E and F) star (which is made up of onli a single syllable, sounds like the G while singing the ABC song)...this identical rhyme makes it easier for children to recall their ABC's because by teaching children songs with the same tune, the tune would be drilled into their minds and this tune can then help them in reciting their ABC's.. its quit like when we try to re-sing our fav. songs. we have to say the lyrics in the same tune as tht of the song because that tends to help us with recalling the lyrics of the song...

I think that allowing stupid people to say whatever they want is an efficient way of keeping them readily identifiable for the rest of us.  It's much cheaper than printing up millions of t-shirts saying, "Don't listen to me; I'm an idiot."  It's more humane than facial tattoos saying, "My opinions are worthless because I don't think critically."  Stickers warning "TV tells me what to think" might be nice, but the people who most need them are the ones least able to put them on without help.  Free speech helps us know who the fools among us are.

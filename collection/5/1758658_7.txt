No one just studies water, without doing it in some context.  If the context is the distribution and movement of water, the science is hydrology.  If it's the physical properties of water, the science is physical chemistry.  If it's water in the atmosphere, the science is meteorology.  If it's the quality and purity of natural water, the science is environmental chemistry.  Etc.

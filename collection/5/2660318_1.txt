There was once a Malay guy who told my Indian friend that Biryani was a "Malay" food. My friend related angrily to me how ridiculously stupid that Malay guy was to think Biryani was malay cusine.. Coincidentally, my friend is from Hyderabad.. It's in the state of Andhara Pradesh, Hyderabad is a city with a majority Muslim Indian population. They are decendants of the Mughals, who invaded India originating from Persia.. Thus, their food is very different. According to my friend, it's where the famous Hyderabadi Biryani and delicious North Indian cuisine such as the Tandoori meat comes from.. Its a delicious mixture of rice, spices, meat or vegetables cooked with yoghurt, cooked in a delicate matter. It's usually topped with fried onions and served with yoghurt chutney on the side.. . Everything has to be precise for the biryani to taste like how it's supposed to. . For a picture of his home-cooked Hyderabadi biryani to get a basic idea of how it looks like,. check this out:. http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenova/85860994/

Basically take notes about what is happening in the meeting, then after it is over, type out what happened during the meeting so it looks nice, then make sure everyone involved gets a copy. They call them "minutes" because you type everything out in the order that it happened. You have to say who said what (mainly the key discussions), all topics and subjects, and more importantly, the date & time, and also who attended the meeting. You should even put what time it started and what time it ended.

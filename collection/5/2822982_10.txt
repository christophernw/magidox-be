I asked the same question once.. . I have seen all of the movies so far. I asked a girl at my work some questions that I needed further explaination on. She told me after each and every question I asked read the books.. . I ahve started to read them. I am still on the first one. I have had already answered some of my questions that I had asked her. I am only on the 3rd chapter.. . So in answer to your question I would think not. so far at least.

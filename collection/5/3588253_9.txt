Somalis and other African immigrants speak English.. Korean grocers speak English...at least enough to do business and be civil.. A lot of immigrants speak English.. Plenty of Vietnamese immigrants speak English.. A lot of Asian immigrants speak English and want to work on getting rid of their accents..  Then there are the ones that don't even bother because we have been so damn accomodating.. I live in Seattle.. Lots of Asian and African immigrants here...... all trying hard.

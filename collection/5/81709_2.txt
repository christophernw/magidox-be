There are two rivers, the White Nile and the Blue Nile, which join at Khartoum in the Sudan to form the Nile. The name comes from the Semitic root word nahal ‘river’. Sections of the river have different names such as the Victoria Nile (between Lake Victoria and Lake Albert); it becomes the Albert Nile when it leaves the northern end of that lake; then the Bar al-Jabal ‘Mountain River (Nile)’ when it enters the Sudan. It is joined by the Bar al-Ghazl ‘River of the Antelopes’, a left-bank tributary, and becomes the White Nile (in Arabic, al-Bar al-abyad from al, bar and abyad ‘white’) after its junction with the Sobat River above Malakl. Largely silt-free, viewed at certain times the river appears a little white. The upper reaches of the Blue Nile (in Arabic, al-Bar al-azraq from azraq ‘blue’) are known as the Abay or Abbai. At times the water reflects the sky, hence the name ‘Blue Nile’.

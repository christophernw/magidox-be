It basically means.. well let me give u an example... I have a nextel phone.. which means that if im on say a Verzion tower... im roaming.. thats all.. but you need to drop a line to ur provider.. and tell them that u aint in nyc any more.. taht you are in VT.. so tell them and they will help ya.. cuz you can rack up some major bills by roaming...

i think people shoot birds just to be mean to something. it is proven that people that hurt animals on purpose have a tendency to abuse people. if someone is not around that they can abuse they take out their frustrations on animals.. i think it is disgusting that there are people out there that hurt innocent animals just because the person has a problem.

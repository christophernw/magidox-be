It's what it represents and what it calls to remembrance, not the article itself. It helps us remember the covenants we made in the temple. I've heard stories of how people were protected from red hot metal that burnt through their outer clothes but didn't even singe their garments (it's what we call our underware). I feel that I've been protected spiritually by wearing them. But just as all things that require faith, it requires faith to work. . And to clear up some misconceptions, while the garment is available in one piece, it is also available in two piece, and in various lengths but none shorter than knee length and just at the shoulder. . In a world where morals are in short supply, and clothing in even shorter supply, the garment does require certain standards be met with regard to length. But that's not the purpose it was originally intended for, it's just a nice little extra. . To talk any more about it would disregard the sacredness of what happens in the temple.

actualy the machine that can split atoms could probly be made in your garage.  You could either build a cyclotron or a nuclear pile.  In both cases though you could only split very heavy atoms (such as uranium or thorium) and those would be very hard to get a hold of.  . If you want to split smaller atoms you would need a more powerful particle accelerator(linier accelerator or synclotron), or a very powerful lazer.  . . The only one that at home you would really have a chance of making is the cyclotron, and if you did some junkyard shoping i would guess that you could make a simple one for about a thousand dollars.  For plans to do that I would say look it up on the interweb

Start with a small restaurant as manager or assistant mgr (sometimes when you work at a place that's managed by the owner they'll let you call yourself the manager so then on your next resume... ding!)... that's how I did it... then the next place bigger or wait until you r mgr of a small place by outlasting everyone and working yourself to the bone, then start working up in rest. size... I don't know about your education, but classes in mgmt, marketing and accounting help. There are certain places that have mgr. training programs, as well, like Pizza Hut, KFC, MCDUCK'S, many of the chain stores... You apply for those and then in a while you have your own store (small one) and your foot in the door of a larger corporation... good luck.

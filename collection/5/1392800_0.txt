Bulls are colour blind, and therefore are not irritated at all simply by the colour red at a bullfight. What they are really attracted to is the waving object which catches their side vision and activates their hunting instinct.  One theory about why red is chosen is that the scarves were actually white (or a more natural linen colour), but since they were reused often (and usually covered in blood by the end of it), they stained red.  Thus, people started just dying the cloth red from the begining.

"Mission was Not Accomplished"  our president just wanted to play "Topgun". . If you read the history of Iraq, you will know that there has always been fighting in the region between factions or tribes.  Iraq was never actually a country but was created by the British. So, for Iraq it is just the state of going back to normal.. . Bush should have read history and believed the UN observers.. . The war is still going on because it will always go on and always has been going on since ancient times.  If anything, Saddam was the one who brought unity to the "country" and squelched the civil uprisings but at a great cost to his countrymen.  . . The only way we can "win" the war is to nuke Iraq off the face of the Earth because we cannot send in enough soldiers to contain the violence and try to maintain the level of stewardship required to police a place to which we were not invited, never should have gone, and are deeply resented.

what did you do to the poor animal they are acting like that because they got the taste of rabbit blood in there sistem and they won't more and they won't stop the solution in not to put the animal down it is to find the answer. first off if the rabbit is in there territory, in the fence, let them have it if the rabbit is that stupid. if they are digging put red pepperin the ground and let them have a wiff of that once they stir that dirt up the pepper will burn, but also some dogs don't seem to mind it though. the rabbits, trick the dog kill a rabbit load it with red pepper and, don't skin the rabbit though let them think it is alive, use your imagination but once they bit into it there mouth will start burning . use some other powder that is hot but don't torture the dog . you might have to do it over and over again because some dogs have a short attention span

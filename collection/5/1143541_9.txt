sometimes we feel as what we do simply isn't enough and we thing badly of ourselves.  It's okay I know that feeling, and never think that your best isn't enough because there's nothing better than that.  I used to feel like that a lot.  Maybe you'd feel better if you spent time with loved ones, they could make you feel much better than what anyone will have to say on this.  good luck!

Spray the furniture with citrus deodorizer and SCOLD him.  Clipping his nails will make him claw more trying to sharpen them again.  And we won't even go near declawing.  Just be persistant with the scolding and spray.. . Declawing is extremely painful to the cat.  unless you are certain you will outlive her, how do you know she'll go somewhere where she won't need her claws.  This should be outlawed!

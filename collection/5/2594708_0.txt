I knew I was prego at 2 weeks. I couldn't handle many smells or tastes. I took a test and I was preg. By 4 wks my boobs were killing me. It all depends on the person. I never got morning sickness at all. If you suspect that you are, you need to get into a doctor right away. It is best to know for sure so that you can start pre-natal care. I hope it turns out the way you want it to. Good luck(if you think you are anyway) :)

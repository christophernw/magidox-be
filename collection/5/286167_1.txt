could you first please explain what you have to offer our country?-for example do you have a trade or proffession? are you qualified in medicine?-if you have none of these then forget it the government are at long last clamping down on asylum seekers and very soon the only ones allowed in will be those with something to offer the country. there will be no benefits you will have to earn your living using your proffessional skills.

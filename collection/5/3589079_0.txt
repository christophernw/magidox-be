I think it's got something to do with where you're race started out from. For example, Africans tended to have very dark skin because their skin had to protect itself against the harsh sun and winds. So as well as being genetic in the passing down of skin colour, it's got something to do with where your ancestors lived. That's my opinion anyhow.

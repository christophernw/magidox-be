I raised to sons on my own and I came out to them when one was 13 and the other 15. They both said when I told them,... Dad we wondered when you would get a clue!. . It seems as though we think our children don't know us, I think they know us much better then we know them and sometimes better then we know ourselves.. . You are living with a man and your child is 6 I never felt like putting more on my children then what they could handle for their age and maturity.. . Perhaps she already knows inside of her little child like 6 year old mind. You dont know what she is hearing when she is not near you or with her other family. Nor do you know what she sees with you and your partner whether or not you call yourselves friends.. . You and your partner need to be loving and supportive of your daughter she hopefully will grow up with two stable parents (you two) and will be fine. See it doesn't matter if you are two men together or not it's about how you love, and accept yourselves and how you educate your daughter with the true meanings in life.. . You need not "confess" "come out" to your daughter if you both are open enough she will be comfortable and secure enough to ask the questions when and if she needs to.. . But also don't hide your love and relationship that is one of the worst things you can do ............that is very deceiving!

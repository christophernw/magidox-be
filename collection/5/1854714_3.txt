Caffine isn't all that bad,what is bad is the yellowing of the teeth from alot of coffee consumption. There is no perfect thing out there that is just perfect in every way that wont harm you later down the line or give you some side effect or hook you and you'll love it for life.Everything nowadays seems to be good for you,but in moderation, except illegal drugs,now those are bad,and smoking,that really will make you stink lol.!!

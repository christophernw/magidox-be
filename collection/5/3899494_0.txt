The liver contains many enzymes which are used to detoxify chemicals and useless compounds that are in to human body.  The names are not important, but that they are known is good enough for you to understand.. If your blood is tested and excessive amounts of any of these enzymes are found it usually means that the liver is damaged or is producing more of these enzymes that normal.. Alcohol, hydrocarbons, drugs (including Tylenol) and other compounds can do this.  There are also diseases, usually called Hepatitis (but there are others) that can damage the liver tissue and allow the enzymes to be released.

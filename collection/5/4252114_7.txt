I definately hope to learn something. I'm not looking to convert, and I sure don't expect to find Jesus while weeding through one sided teenage rants. BUT I agree, there is alot I can learn, not nessicarially the word of god, but how to apply basic morals and human understanding to my social relationships. I respect your faith even though I do not agree with it, I hope you can do the same in letting me browse your thoughts on it as well.

In short, much scientific terminology is logical and consistent (sounds like how it is spelled and roots of words carry over to other words).  By contrast, English in particular is a very illogical and inconsistent language, where tough/cough/plough/dough and said/maid/plaid don't rhyme even though they look like they should.  It wouldn't surprise me at all that people who have difficulty remembering conventional English spellings (which really are they way they are because that's how everyone spells them) can still spell scientific terms accurately.

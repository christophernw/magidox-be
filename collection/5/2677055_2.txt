You have to join groups that compel comments as part of the group like "Hit Miss Maybe"  "Comments, Comments, Comments".  The drawback is that people comment on just what they like, and are not always well informed about photography or art or criticism in general so the comments may not be great.  The plus side is that they will usually point out things that might make a photo more "marketable" than another which is helpful to most people.  So give it a try!

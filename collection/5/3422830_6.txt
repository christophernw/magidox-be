First of all, the side we see is not always the dark side.. . But if you're talking about the expression the "dark side", it's the side that you can't see.. . But why do we only see one side of the moon?. . Well, the moon the rotate, but at the same time, it is revolving around the Earth, and apparently the time it takes for the moon to orbit once is exactly the same as the time it takes for the moon to rotate around its axis once.

Mexico can't be made a state because 90% of the mexicans are illiterate.  They cannot read or write, talk English, can't figure (math)...they live by intuition.  They live by stealing or conning others (experienced) and they bring their crimes and traditions from other countries with them.  That means they don't want to be a US citizen, they just want to be their same self on our land even with all of their faults...If this is allowed to continue there will be nothing left of a United States of America, we will turn into a 3rd world country.. . Some people believe that turning the US into a 3rd world country is the thing to do, these people...all of them, are the enemy to freedom of the world as the US is practically the only Freedom Loving Country on Earth.  All other nations are under some sort of Hierarchy of a two-type people.  The very, very, very wealthy and the very, very, very poor.  Nothing in between.  America believes everyone has the right to be free, and as our Constitution says, we have the right to pursue happiness, and alot of countries don't allow you to do that.

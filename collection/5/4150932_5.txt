That is funny.  Reminds me of the time when our daughter was a baby and had a suction toy that went on the tray of her high chair.  My husband put it on his forehead thinking it would be funny.  It was, still, 4 days later with a big round target "hickey"!  You could try a wash clothe soaked in Epsom salt water.  Otherwise, makeup and time.

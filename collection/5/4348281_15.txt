This is my take on it. It could be that in some verses they are referring to an actual being of the sea. But sometimes it is almost hinting to the possibility that it is being compared to the hideous,crude, sinful behavior humans could be seen displaying and how God intended to destroy it under his own heel. Good luck w/ this! <><

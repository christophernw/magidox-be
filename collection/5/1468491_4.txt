If it's perfectly sealed inside of the pipe, it will block the exhaust gasses and I'd assume eventually cause the car to stall out when all of that spent gas and air can't go anywhere.  . . MOST IMPORTANTLY though, it will surely find the first leak in the exhaust system and will leak into the car.  Engine fumes are not something to mess around with--they're noxious and can kill someone.  Don't monkey around with someone's car like that, and save everyone the trouble.

Calico cats are female and they are cute.  I have a "faded calico" kitten, and she looks white, a muted pinkish orange and grey.  So not all calicos are bright white, orange and black.. . They are female because it is a sex-linked trait.  Someone once told me that there can be 1 in a milloin male calicos, but our vet sayd this is not true.

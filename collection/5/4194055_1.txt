it is not easy to be taller after a limit of age. it depends on your physical fit and growth. it also depends on heridatory cycles. if you are within 25 and below 25 you may practice in ring hanging and you may exercise physically on guidance of a physical instructor. if you wish to be taller any how you may artificially tall you by using high hill shows even as is seen used by short ladies! thank you

> we don't .... we just have to trust them ppl who call themselves scientists... <. . That's right!  Those damn scientists, with their telescopes, and their movies showing the sun rotating, and videos on their web sites, and centuries of observations and drawings (I thought we arrested that criminal Galileo with his ridiculous sunspot drawings), and their photographs, and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers, and their big conventions, and their big space telescopes (Hubble-whatever, yeah right!).  All a big hoax.  A massive conspiracy!. . And people here can post links that I can click on, but that's *way* too much trouble!  And besides, they're by people like "NASA" and "Cornell University", so how can anybody trust them?. . And even though you and I can can buy a simple telescope (or even use a pinhole on a piece of paper) and project it on a sheet of paper and *draw* the image over the course of a few days ... it's all just a *trick*.  Those sneaky scientists!. . Just like with "evolution" ... there's just no *evidence*.. . (Sorry for the sarcasm, but why do people distrust scientists *so* much?  What do they have to gain for all getting together to trick people?  Why do some people value ignorance so very much that they cling to it like a rock?)

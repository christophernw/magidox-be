i dunno the answer 2 dis question. but u have a BSL problem. thats like racist but for dogs. u want that pit bull to die just because he's a pit bull. and u say that its because of the ppl who own them. but that guy was trying to help his pit bull. u are disgusting. and i hope u go 2 hel. i have a pit bull and mine won the AKC Canine Citizen Award. so shut it. im a good owner, i take full responsiblity for my dog. u dont know what u are talking about. Pit Bulls are statistically higher in the temperament toward kids then all other breeds.. .  as the saying goes: ppl THOUGHT u were stupid. dont open ur mouth and REMOVE all doubt.. . this is what u said:. . not long enough...those dogs are mean. I love dogs, but most people who own them only want them for their aggressiveness.

just let her know that you're there for you...as a parent (and this is just an educated guess after having a heart to heart with my mom when she practically in the same state so don't neccessarily quote me on it), they don't really want us as their children to 'support' them, per se, but acknowledge all of the effort that they put into making your life and their homes peaceful and pleasant everyday. If you feel she needs time away from the house, then just ease your way into the routine and try to pick up some of the general daily tasks for yourself (whatever you're able to handle/ help with). You don't have to spell it out as "Here, Mom, I'll do this so you can go...", (although you can to emphasize your effort and be sure she understands that this IS a gift for her and not just time for her to move on to a different chore) but she'll see the opportunity and take it if that is what she needs.. . Other than that, the number one thing is just to tell her you love her and that she is a good person for being HER and not just cook or maid or even mom or wife! More than any figurative picture, and hug will mean a thousand words!

I think it's because DNA needs thymine to replicate and produce daughter strands, and also protects the DNA from attack and manipulation. However RNA does not need this as it is not a part of a genomic building block ie/ all organisms are made up of DNA, so it uses uracil.. . Do i get a nobel prize now?

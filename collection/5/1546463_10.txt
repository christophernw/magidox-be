If you were out in space in orbit around the sun at a distance similar to that of Earth's, you would find it extremely bright. Astronauts who spacewalk have to wear tinted visors, or they will go blind from the bright solar rays. It is actually brighter up there than it is down here, because down here the atmosphere absorbs a lot of that light before it gets here.. . However, if what you mean by that is, why isn't space "blue" like blue skies, that is because Earth's atmosphere diffuses the incoming light, much the same way the plastic covers on fluorescent lights spreads the light out from the fluorescent tube. It diffuses into a  blue hue, because the atmosphere itself has a bit of a blue tint.

IUI? do you mean an IUD? If so, not big at all. I had one for 5 years, best part is that i didnt get my period at all,.. it was great. It didnt hurt and never bothered me. Since it does nothing to your body (like birth control tricks it into thinking you are pregnant) as soon as you are ready to have it taken out you can get pregnant.. stress free, you dont have to remember the pills every day, or the pain of the shot...

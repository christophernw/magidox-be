Unless you've actually DONE this it's hard to understand.. . You LOVE your child and you want them to UNDERSTAND what they need to know. You are also concerned about PROTECTING them. So you talk to your kids more delicately than you do your friends.... . It's better to tell them when they're younger so they go, "YECH-I'm NEVER gonna do THAT, dad!"

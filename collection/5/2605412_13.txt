Well, you see what happened was,  Sarah's handmaiden gave birth to Ismael before Isaac was born.  Abraham wasn't married to the girl, but Ismael is his son.  When Isaac was born, the two were thrown out.  Not nice.  But God, in His wisdom, opened up the sands in the desert so they could survive.  The jealousy between Sarah and her handmaiden, and Ismael and Isaac is still going today.  God is the same, so everything He said back then still goes.  The land that you call "Palestine" never belonged to Ismael.  It never will.  When God said to Abraham, "In Isaac,  shall thy seed be blessed,"  He meant it.  The land belongs to the Israelis, and more land than they claim right now.  . . Why don't the descendants of Ismael, the ones who control the oil, turned the Saudi Arabian Desert into a Palestinian Homeland?  They've got the loot to do it, you know.  Ah, but that wouldn't be the land that God gave to Abraham THROUGH ISAAC, and that's what they want.

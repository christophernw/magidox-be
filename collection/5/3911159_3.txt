Birds develop an effinity for males or females quite often.  Its normal for a bird to become fixated on females if they had a bad experience with a male.  The only thing you could try to do is to allow more males to handle it.  Leave the bird out on the floor or chair with a male sitting nearby.  If the male doesn't pay attention to the bird and lets the bird become comfortable with him the bird is likely to warm up to that person and walk over to them.  Good luck.

Your site is great.  The prices are good and the products are uniquie and very good quality.  Also, the site LOOKS good.. . I do a LOT of online shopping.  I would not shop at your store, because it does not have the reputation of the places I shop at and trust (Amazon, Macy's, Overstock, Tiffany's, etc.).  I was burned once by an unknown, small company...I won't make that mistake again.. . Until you can build your reputation, sell on Amazon or eBay as a Store.. . Advertise on Craig's List.. . Advertise specials...free shipping is always a great one.. . If I get more ideas, I'll send them over.. . Best of luck.. . PS, how can you sell the Diamond 'X' Bracelet for so cheap?  That is really a good price.

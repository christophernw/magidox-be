Stop thinking of Black people as a monolithic group that all think alike because they are just as individual as the next person. Besides, there is some form of racist in EVERY group on the planet.  . . Maybe the Blacks you've ran into gave you unfortunate experiences, but just because you've ran into one or a couple bad apples dosen't mean that the whole tree is bad.  So you need to reprogram your thinking now so you won't think that way.

Locust is the name given to the swarming phase of short-horned grasshoppers of the family Acrididae. The origins and apparent extinction of certain species of locust—some of which reach 6 inches (15 cm) in length—are unclear.. . These are species that can breed rapidly under suitable conditions and subsequently become gregarious and migratory. They form bands as nymphs and swarms as adults- both of which can travel great distances, rapidly stripping fields and greatly damaging crops.

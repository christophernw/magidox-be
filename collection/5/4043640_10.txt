They say time is a healer of all things but that doesn't help when you are mourning over the lost of a friends, much like a bereavement.. . If there is no way you could keep in touch, I would advise that you try to bring other things into your life. Join clubs, try to make new friends and keep yourself busy.. . I went through the same things when a very dear neighbour of mine moved. I missed her terribly. You will get over it and in time you will just remember the pleasant times you had with that person.

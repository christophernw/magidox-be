i don't really know what your question means, but it seems like you need help flinding a home?  you should start by getting a good realtor.  if you don't already have one, there are tons on these directories.  just go to http://www.idxbroker.com/news/256_IDX,_Inc._Introduces.php and click on your state.  good luck ;)

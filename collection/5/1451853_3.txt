Why should the pope (a religious leader) have anything to say about what scientists do?  Scientists should be able to do whatever they have to do to figure out once and for all what caused us to be here.  . . Religious leaders really get on my nerves, they believe things that so obviously aren't true and then denounce anything that doesn't go along with what they believe in, and get mad when religion is referred to as mythology (which is really what it is).

HUMANS DID NOT COME FROM APES. . Humans and apes evolved from the same ancestor.. . Humans moved from the forests/jungles to the plains and because fo this started walking upright .... apes stayed int he trees so didn't.. . This is yet another "question" from someone who knows nothing at all about evolution, yet tries to use false quotes to support creationism.

If you are looking for a fun job and you like younger people working in a summer camp is a lot of fun people don't realize how much fun it can really be until you try it. I promise it is nothing like the Friday the 13th movies. Its not hard work so much as an experience that you will probably never forget as well as the kids you work with.

I can't see how the world is more corrupt. The arena death sports in Roman times seemed pretty sick. Ritual sacrifice and dueling in the streets seems fairly uncommon compared to history. I think we are much more civilized and therefor more prone to being disturbed by corruption. We had lots of drunken philandering presidents in the past. Because of our sensitivity to corruption, we were appalled by Monica-gate in a way that we have never been before. If he'd sent conquered soldiers to die in the mouths of starving and provoked large cats, well, lets just say we wouldn't be reading his books or debating whether his wife would make a good future pres.

i'll probably confuse you if i try to give you a definition in academic terms because there are so many ways to do it and I am not a finance person myself - so I'll give you a simple example of hedging against exchange rates.. . Say you decide you're going to buy a large order of something from a company in another country. Right now the exchange rate is so that the order will cost about 1000 USD. However you don't have to pay until the order is received in about 90 days. The problem is that the exchange rate between you and the other country is not stable and it seems that the trend is against your favor and you are worried that when you have to pay the exchange rate will be so bad that you have to pay much more, like 1300 USD - but you have no way of being sure. So you buy the option to trade 1000 USD for the amount of the invoice in the future - so that way no matter what happens to the currency rate, you know exactly that you will pay 1000 USD (if the currency exchange moves in your favor and in fact you could have paid only 800 dollars you can decide to not exercise (use) the option but you still lose the money you spent buying the option in the first place). . basically that's a very simple direct way you use hedging for one specific risk. in general companies and people will start a HEDGE FUND rather than a mutual fund if they are more sophisticated investors because it's a pretty aggressive portfolio. By using hedging on both sides (if the security goes up or down) the goal is to get a maximum rate of return, using strategies involving options, short selling, and leverage. On the other hand, because they often use futures, swaps, and arbitrage strategies, you could argue that hedge funds diversify away some of the investor risk of the stock market.

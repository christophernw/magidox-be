Try making love slowly, drawing it out so that she's worn out.  It's the adrenalin rush some women get during great sex that's keeping her awake.  She could try an over-the-counter sleep aide, or ask her doctor for a prescription for something if the otc doesn't work.  You could also try giving her a soothing back rub afterwords, that sometimes will calm someone enough to help them get to sleep.

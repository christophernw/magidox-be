I know a hypochondriac and yes she does need to be the center of attention, infact whenever she is sick it is obvious she is making it sound worse than it really is. I have sat at her house talking to her with her sounding rather normal and when the phone rings she answers with a really sick sounding hello. It really annoys me but I'm sure it is just attention seeking. As for how to deal with it, if you don't like the person just say something but it's not like anything would do any good.

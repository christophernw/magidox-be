If you are in good standing w/ creditors - no late payments, and such...you can actually call them and ask for a temporary reduction in interest for a finite period of time..... . The fact that you bought a home is a good sign.  You might call a realtor to run "comps" to get a ballpark figure of the value of your home - maybe it's increased enough to obtain a home equity line of credit - (not that attaching your only asset to old debt is a great idea, but.....)   . . In fact, if you are paying PMI ($45ish/mo) you may not need to - get a value and if you owe less than 80% of the VALUE, you can get the PMI removed..... . Blue collar attitude might be:  cut the cable tv $40.                                                 cut the internet $25.                                                 cut the cell phone $50.    make sure your landline is the cheapest plan possible - no call waiting, no caller ID , and certainly no long distance plan on the landline..... There's a quick $100/mo that might help....Not Forever....just til you can get a handle on the worst of your debt.. . Pay the smallest balances first......pay minimums on all others and slam down the small debt....then go to the next smallest balance and slam that one down... . I'd stay away from debt consolidation companies....you can do what they can w/out destroying your credit completely.....get your bills together and start calling  - be polite and they will work with you.....good luck.

U have to admit we r a little spoiled over here!  lol  Most homes have 2 to 3 tv's my son has 5 different video game systems including the xbox 360.  and 4 of the hand held game systems.  We can eat whatever we want when we want it.  We can go wherever we want when we want too.  We have total 100% freedom and we have it pretty easy compared to alot of other countries!  Thank God for the good old U S of A!!!

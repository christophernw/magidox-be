Well, yes, practice, practice, practice - with your left hand alone. Practice your scales, your sheet music, your chords etc, with your left hand w/o using your right. Once you have mastered a scale or song, then use both hands to get the coordination between the two. . . There's really no magic remedy for this. You have to train the muscles of your left hand to obey the commands of your brain by using those muscles over and over.. . If you are having problems with flexibility in your left hand, then there is an exercise that can help. Make a peace sign with your left hand - the "V" with your pointer and middle fingers. Use your other hand to spread the V apart as wide as you can without hurting yourself. Repeat with all fingers/thumb several times a day. I do this with both hands, and it helps loosen them up.

That is obviously a stereotype.  There is absolutely no relation between geographic location and overall intelligence. Sometimes, in areas dominated by big, extended families (especially ones that intermarry), certain genes for intelligence (or lack thereof) tend to appear more often than others, and so residents of these areas are (again, stereotypically) labeled according to the general IQ trend. But when it comes to actually trying to tell whether a person is dumb or smart just from where he/she lives, then that is pure nonsense.. And by the way, not all statistics are to be trusted.

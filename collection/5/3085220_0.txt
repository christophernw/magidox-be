That's the part where the new nail is growing- underneath the existing nail.  It is white, because it is not laying against the skin, as the rest of the nail is.  The skin has blood vessels under it, which tint the skin pink, which is why that part of the nail is pink.  If you notice, the end of the nail is white, too, because that is no longer laying on skin.

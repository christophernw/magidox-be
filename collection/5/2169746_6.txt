In your arm pits and between your legs, sounds like Hidradenitis Supportiva.  There is no cure, and it's no boils. They are abcesses.  Use Tea Tree Oil on them to help them heal faster. Call around for a dermatologist and specifically ask if they know how to treat HS. So few doctors do, but it could possibly require surgery.

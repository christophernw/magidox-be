it can be risky, but if precautions are taken in every case you are likely to be more safe. risks only truly arise with unprotected sex. however condoms are only 96% guaurenteed, so there is always a risk, and it is better not to have to many sexual partners.. . best way.. is to not get drunk! and to not sleep with every guy that asks!!!

I believe to younger drivers who are at under 18 should not be allowed to talk and drive on the cell phone for they don't have that much driving experiance.  Some may say they drive a lot buy you have to set that bar somewhere.  In Minnesota its 18 and older can use the phone while driving, and if you get caught using it as a minor you get ticketed for it as far as I know.

look there is no easy way apart from bending the door i guess its one of those lockers that has a latch that goes into a hole in the side of the locker..paper clips are too weak they will just bend try something a bit sturdier like 2 safety pins...ok what you have in any lock is a system of pins so you have too trigger those to release the lock then push the latch up whilst leavin the safety pins in place....you can also try lookin at the side where the hinges are there will b a pin that goes through the hinge at the end (normally bottom) that doesn't have a rounded end get sumthin that will fit thro the hole(again this will have to be strong so sumthin like a really small screwdriver the type you use for watches or glasses) you may have to use a bit of force to remove these but push them up and out in both hinges...if you go down the route of bending the door then bend it from the side that hasn't got hinges, you could probably be able to bend it back near enough to get it closed again....or how about nicking his keys when you have got p.e and gettin it then,or find sumway to get the spare key of the teachers.good luck m8 i hate a-holes like that.he's probably moved it anyway so just dump him in the school pond!!!

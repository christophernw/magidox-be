I define an american is one who is here legally that pays taxes on hisor her taxable income.  An american is not one who gets paid "CASH".  An american can read and speak the english language with minimal proficiency.  An american obeys the laws of this country.  It is illegal to cross our borders with out checking with this county; therefore an illegal immigrant is never and will never be an AMERICAN".  An american will never fly an upside down american flag under the mexican flag as had occured in So. california

Some people just naturally sweat more - its their metabolism. While you may want to consult your doctor to see if thats the case or you really do have a problem PLEASE try using  "DEGREE" Ultra Dry.., use the SPRAY ON ONLY!.. . I have a problem with extra sweaty armpits - and this is the ONLY product that works for me. I've tried everything else like you did only to end up with a really rank smelling set of arm pits - and thats simply Not Cool.. . Degree smells good and does the job.

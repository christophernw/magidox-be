First of all, id like to know why so many illigal aliens are spending there INDEPENDANCE day bothering us? do we go down there on the 4th of july and bother them? no we dont. To me, if they want a good cinci de mayo, they shoudl discuss making there country better so they dont have to come here.. weve got enough mouths to feed..HAVE THEY NOT SEEN OUR ECONOMY? they should just go home and take Bush with em.. maybe he can help their country.. hes obviously not helping us.

The best way to get a good one is to buy from a reputable breeder. Go to www.akc.org & get in touch with members of the closest chapter of the Doberman Pinscher club. Buy from a breeder that tests & certifies their breeding dogs free from genetic defects, including hip dyslpasia & Von Willebrands disease (a type of hemophila). They will be able to help you pick the pup in the litter that's personality will best fit your household, and advise you on the time for ear cropping - they may even reccomend a particular vet for this procedure. This is the best way to ensure you purchase a healthy pet for life, plus you will always have the support of the breeder when any questions arise in the future. Good luck!

The best thing for tooth pain at home is to take 800 mg of Ibuprofen which is prescription strength... you can take this every 6-8 hrs as needed for pain.  It has an anti-inflammatory in it so it will work better than Tylenol or aspirin.  Be careful not to overuse Ibuprofen as it is harsh on the lining of the stomach and could cause problems.  Do make sure to see your dentist as soon as possible if you are having a toothache so he or she can evaluate and do necessary treatment.

As Christians we remember that the first commandment states, "I am the Lord thy God. You shall not have any gods before me.". . When asked what was the greatest commandment, Jesus said, "You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, with your whole soul, and with all of your strength" (Matthew 22:37). . . While God can choose to reveal the future to His prophets, we as individuals must always have trust in His divine providence. While we may have that passing curiosity of what will happen in the future, we anchor our lives in the Lord, trusting in His love and care. . . To try to discover the future through palm reading, tarot cards, or some other form of fortunetelling, or to try to control the future through black magic, witchcraft, or sorcery violates the first commandment. . . Sacred Scripture has many warnings of these activities: Exodus 22:17, Exodus 22:19, Leviticus 20:27, and Deuteronomy 18:10-12.. . With love in Christ.

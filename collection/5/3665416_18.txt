Your "question" illistrates perfectly the confusion that many  devout people feel when trying to inject a mindful creator's "plan" into their life.  If there was a plan then neither act, (sex or childbirth), would be painful. But in reality most things that are worthwhile have some sort of inherit adversity or discomfort that makes the final outcome enormously rewarding.

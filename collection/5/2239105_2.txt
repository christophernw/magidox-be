thermonuclear fusion is the use of very high temperatures, such as that generated by a nuclear fission reaction, and very high pressures of hydrogen isotopes (such as deuterium) to cause the fusion of these isotopes into helium.  In doing this, massive amounts of energy is released when the nucleii fuse and some mass is lost during the reaction, resulting in the energy generated by the equation E=mc^2.  The pros of this process is that it generates even more energy than a normal nuclear fission reaction because the mass of deuterium is low and so more of it can be put into a small area efficiently.  Also, fusion uses hydrogen to fuse together, and leaves very little radio active waste.  The only products generated from this reaction is helium and excess neutrons, rather than lighter radioactive elements like that of fission.  The problem, however, is inherent in the process of thermonuclear fusion.  The process requires temperatures in the millions of degrees Kelvin, temperatures found in the sun, or in nuclear fission reactions.  Thus, to generate the environment for fusion to occur, one must detonate a primary fission reaction to generate the temperature, then allow for the fusion of deuterium.  This defeats the purpose of making it cleaner w/ less radioactive waste, but will indeed generate more energy.

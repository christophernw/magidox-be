You got 3 wrong; The Bible is in complete agreement.. . Other than that I would also add, . . (6) Claim that their church is the only church, and that if you don't believe EXACTLY as they do you are going to hell.. . . Thankfully, most Christians are not "religious fundamentalist morons.". . . In contrast, I would encourage you to use your intelligence and powers of reason to:. 1) Question some of the theories of science.. 2) Examine the Bible to see if it is historically accurate, and if it deserves your trust.. 3) Examine many translations to minimize your dependence upon any interpreter's bias. 4) Encourage young minds to question everything they are taught, whether in church, at home, or in school.. . . I believe in doing things on faith.  Most people, however, do things not on faith, but on pride.  They are so sure that they are right that they will not listen to reason.  That is actually a lack of faith.  I trust my beliefs.  I trust them enough to put them on the line.  If anyone can show me that their views are more logical than my own, I will change my views.  I seek truth, not arrogance.

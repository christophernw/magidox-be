a second interview is a good thing.. you made it past the first round.. interviews go in rounds for various reasons.. FIRST-so each level of management in a given department can give their input. .      ex: 3 rounds-1st with hiring mngr who found you.                   2nd with immediate manager.                   3rd with department head. SECOND-a 2nd int may be required because HR may think someone is a good candidate, but the actual manager of the applied for position may have a different opinion.. THIRD-a 2nd interview can give a better impression.  Perhaps you were nervous the first time.  perhaps you were just having a "good day".  also, it can allow for inconsistencies in your interviews to be questioned.  .        ex: 1st int you said you left last job for one reason.            2nd int you say you left for a totally dif.     .               reason.. if you made it through the first you should have no problem with second.  stay calm, positive and assertive of your capabilities!. . GOOD LUCK!

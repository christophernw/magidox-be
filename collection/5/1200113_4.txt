It could be the reason.  Others are right, though, it could be an excuse.  My girlfriend has bipolar.  For a while, before she got on the right meds, it was really hard for her to function.  She flunked out of two schools and lost several jobs because she couldn't/wouldn't go.  Part of it WAS that she was bipolar and that it was hard for her to function, but part of it was that it was an easy crutch for her to lean on so that she wouldn't have to step out of her comfort zone.  So, bipolar CAN make things harder, but it can also be a seductive excuse.  Fight it.  You just gotta get fed up with it and say "I'm not gonna let this control me anymore!". . Best of luck!

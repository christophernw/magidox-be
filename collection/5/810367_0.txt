The universe exists as real matter in nature.  Math is used to produce idealized models of the universe so that we can understand it better.  Moving the earth closer or further from the sun one cm will in fact have a negligible affect but math can calculate the negligible effect given a formula that actually works for large changes, if you carry the calculations to enough decimal places.

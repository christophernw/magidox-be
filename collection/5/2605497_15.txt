The United States military is not failing in Iraq.  . . It is the United States Government which has failed the very Marines, sailor, soldiers and airmen which they sent over there.. . If the US Military would be allowed to do what it is so good at doing, Winning wars, then there wouldn't be a problem in Iraq.  . . The LOOSING is happening in Washington DC.  If we are to go do this, then let's do it and be done with it, and go home.  But too many leftists, civil rights, ignorant sh1theads out there seem to think we like to fight wars.  Most of this I atrribute to the lying media and those who insist on believing their propoganda as truth.. . If we (all of us) support the cause, show some balls, and make it clear that we mean business, we will be taken seriously.  As for now, we are embarassing ourselves there, and here at home, for doing a half-@sses job in a half-@ssed manner.   In the mean time my friends, your families, sons, daughters, husbands, and wives are risking their lives and getting killed for nothing.. . My real concern is what are the Demo(socialist)crats going to do when they take the helm.  If we withdrawl all of our assests from Iraq, right now, the Iraqis will more than likely find a replacement for Sadam and put themselves right back where they were a few years ago.  If we stay, at least we have some idea of what kind of turmoil to expect from that part of the world.  There has always been a war in the mid-east.  All the whining and crying blaming Bush and the Republicans is BS. . .  Maybe had the Demosocialcrats done something about it when it started back when Clinton was avoiding the issues, we wouldn't be there today.

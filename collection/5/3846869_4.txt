It's true - it really does sound just like I or eye!. . IT doesn't ALWAYS mean 'love' of course, it could also mean indigo, accomplice, or mutually, but I HOPE that when 'ai' is a NAME it's always got the 'love' kanji...!! . . (There's even a chain of opticians called アイメガネ / ai-megane! That's ai as in 'eye' of course! Here's a link to their web-site for anyone who doubts .. http://www.aimegane.com/ )

People get offended when they hear the truth because nobody really wants to hear the truth about something, especially if it's about themselves. That's why when we talk to somebody about their bad habits, we always try to "sugar-coat" it a little. Nobody likes anything bitter. Everyone likes to hear sweet things about themselves. But when the truth is hurled into their faces, they get offended by the bluntness of your remark. It also shows that they have a weakness, one that they would rather hide from public view - rather than expose to the world. Hence, nobody likes the truth... even if it is out there.

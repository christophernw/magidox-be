You are right I don't know. But let me tell you something. There's always a way. The US builds a high fence, guess what? People will find a way around it, over it, or even under it. That will not solve immigration.. ANOTHER THING, MEXICANS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES CROSSING THAT BORDER, OK?????? SO STOP STEREOTYPING. BESIDES MEXICANS NEVER CROSSED ANY BORDER, THE BORDER CROSSED THEM SO THERE! WHO ARE THE ILLEGALS IN THIS COUNTRY? NOT MEXICANS, NOT LATINOS, NOT EVEN THE AFRICAN LATINOS, GEE I WONDER WHO ARE? YES YOU GOT IT RIGHT THE EUROPEAN DESENDANT FOLKS. IF YOU CALL A MEXICAN, because that is the only group you seem to point fingers at all the time, WET BACK, THEN ALL YOU EUROPEANS ARE SOAKBACKS!

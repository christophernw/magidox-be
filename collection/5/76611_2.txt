The horizon "adds" size to the sun and moon due to a visual special effect.  It is merely an illusion because the light refraction is strongest along the horizon, causing an elongation of the sphere as it passes that line.  Once the sun or moon pass the horizon, the refraction of the light drops tremendously and the orbs in question "resume" their original shape.

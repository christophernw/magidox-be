It can be tough to get into and out of a pool safely if you are recovering from an injury that may affect your balance.  As with other types of physical therapy, you have to be careful not to try to do too much too soon.  The water can be very healthful, but it can tire out or injure muscles, ligaments, and tendons like other types of resistance exercise if you are not careful.

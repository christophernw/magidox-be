There are various enzyme-based products that are designed to denature urine. I had a mouse problem in an old office and wiped out the odour, and used the stuff at home when my cat sprayed. I bet it would work for rabbits, too.. . "Out!" is one brand that is readily found and comes in a spray bottle. You can get it at Wal-mart, and similar products at Petco, Upco, or Petsmart.

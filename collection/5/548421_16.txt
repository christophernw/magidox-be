Dealing with neighbors is a nightmare. First, try asking them nicely. Make a video tape and show them how annoying this is. Offer to split the cost of having the dogs surgically debarked. Personally, I'd move before I'd live next to a neighbor like that, but sometimes that's not an option. I have a neighbor who goes to work early and slams his car door shut outside my window every morning.  I've padded the glass with those closed-cell foam mats they make for gym flooring and keep a noisy fan or wind machine on while I sleep.  That helps a lot.. . Sounds like you've taken the high road so far in a very frustrating situation. Some fools recommend killing the dogs, which is ridiculous. It's really not the dogs' fault and killing a pet dog is a felony in most states, especially if it's on your neighbor's property. Bad neighbors are big on retaliation. If you kill his dog, who's to say he won't burn down your house? And his next dog might be worse. If you're intent on committing a crime, kill your neighbor instead. (Just kidding!). . Most areas have noise or nuisance laws - sometimes calling the cops can help, sometimes it can make it worse. Animal control will only seize the dogs if they are abused (ie, no shelter, no water, no food, etc). If you don't mind risking a war, get witness statements from your other annoyed neighbors. If the cops won't help, I'd try calling your local TV station and see if they want to do a human interest story on lousy neighbors. Show them as much documentation as you can, pictures and a log of how many times you have called the cops and gotten no help. . . Hmmm... Make an audio tape of the dog barking, call your neighbor (from a pay phone!) and play the tape really loud at three in the morning?

There are many different molecules present in the foods we eat that we are not able to digest. There are symbiotic bacteria in our intestines that are capable of breaking some of these molecules down, though.. . Some byproducts of this bacterial metabolism that are present in flatus include methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. Other ingested gases that aren't expelled through "burping" are later expelled as flatuce. These include nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and hydrogen.. . The bad smelling components of flatuce are produced by the breakdown of proteins by the bacteria. These gases include hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and butyric acid, among others.. . Flatulence can best be prevented by swallowing less air. Chewing gum, drinking carbonated beverages, and smoking can increase the amount of air present in the digestive tract. High fiber foods will cause an increase in gas production. Foods high in sulfur will yield greater amounts of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan, greatly increase the "smell".

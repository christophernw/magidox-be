dont get the disc cleaner it simply messes up the disc and leaves it in a worse condition if you dont know how to use it i clean my discs using home materials like toothpaste, windex, wood cleaners like glo and ive heard of cologne being used after you spread it on the disc leave it on for a few mins and wipe it off with water it takes aways small scratches.

When changing down in a non synchro gearbox, it is essential that an attempt is made to equalise the speed of the gear that is about to be engaged, with dog ring that is about to mesh with it, and lock it to the shaft.By releasing the clutch in neutral, a blip of the throttle will accelerate the dog ring to a similar speed as the lower gear hence no nasty crunch.. The same applies changing up, releasing the clutch momentarily  while in neutral, uses the engine to slow the dog ring.. This whole process is actually easier without using the clutch at all! But only in racing gearboxes !

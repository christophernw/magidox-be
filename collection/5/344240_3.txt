Well without the tibia, you'd be stuck with just the fibula, a skinny bone beside the tibia.... the fibula couldnt support your weight.... the tibia is also a spot that connects your kneecap and allows is to slide freely and protects the joint.. yay for the tibia YAY!...also contains your medial malleolus, or your inner ankle bone, so i guess its purpose could be pain.

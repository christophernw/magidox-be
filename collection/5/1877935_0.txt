This is the way I think of it.. . God (or some other divine power, deity, or group of deities, be that gods and goddesses, Allah, The Force, or what have you) has already laid out the choices you will make in life.  He/She/They/It have created a road map, of sorts, that extends in millions upon millions of different ways with different twists and different ends.. . They give you the map, and you decide which way you want to go.

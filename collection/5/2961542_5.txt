your question is about the colligative properties of water.  colligative properties belong to the liquid (solvent) and do not depend on any of the properties of what you're putting into it (solute). in other words, they depend on how much of the solute you add, not what it is.  For example, for water, adding anything (including salt) raises the boiling point and lowers the melting point.  look up colligative properties for more info

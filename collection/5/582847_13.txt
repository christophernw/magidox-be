He didnt.  Hitler was a bad man, who did bad things.. In his own mind, he tried to "help" Germany out by creating more living space (i.e. by invading surrounding countries), and getting rid of what he considered "Jewish traitors," and all others who muddied the purity of the "superior German race."  . On a side note, did you know the German troops were so successful initially not only due to Hitler's pretty brilliant military strategy/battle tactics, but also because they were all hopped up on meth?  I saw that on the history channel the other day.

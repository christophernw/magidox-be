The courts don't care who gets abused.  Today it is the Fathers (and consequently the children), tomorrow it may well be the Mothers also.  We all lose when someone is separated from one of their parents.  The truth is - it is all about GREED.  Follow the money people, they are dividing and conquering - you just can't see it, or chose to ignore it through those fat checks you receive, upon the misery of children.

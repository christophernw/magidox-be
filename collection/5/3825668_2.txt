Using your correction:. . a) a number's double -> 2x. b) greater than it's half by 45 -> x/2 + 45. c) the two are equal (2x = x/2 + 45). . Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to simplify:.    4x = x + 90. . Now collect like terms.    3x = 90. . Now solve for 'x'. .    x = 90 / 3 = 30. . Now to prove:. . a) number's double -> 2x = 2 * 30 = 60. b) number's half plus 45 -> x/2 + 45 = 15 + 45 = 60. . Both statements hold true, so the number is '30'

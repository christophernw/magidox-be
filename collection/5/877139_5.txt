A paradox is a construction that we believe has false premises, logic or both. "Walking is less tiring than standing" seems paradoxical because there is an underlying premise that walking uses more muscles and therefore should be more tiring. In fact, the muscles used are different and the minor muscles used in maintaining an immobile erect posture fatigue more easily. So, it turns out that 'tiring' isn't what we thought it was going in.. . There are paradoxes that aren't yet resolved. But the belief is that that is a failure of understanding and not a statement about how the world actually is.

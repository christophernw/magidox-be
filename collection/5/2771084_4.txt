Light is both a particle and a wave, depending on how you look at it. Light is both things at the same time. Light reflects, refracts and diffracts like any wave such as a water wave. However light is also particles (photons) that interact with other particles, such as in Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect. Don't try to understand it - it's physics - just believe it.

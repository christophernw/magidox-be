Ostensibly, an honored guest is supposed to sniff the cork in order to make sure the hasn't turned to vinegar in the bottle.  The server will only pour glasses after receiving approval.. . In reality, most of us wouldn't know vinegar from vintage, at least not from the cork alone.  It would have to be pretty obvious.  Nevertheless, the practice has become part of the ritual of serving red wine.  Nobody really expects you to be an expert.. . What may be more important to know is whether or not the red wine has been decanted.  This means the wine has been carefully poured from the original bottle into a new container.  The bitter sediments should be left behind in the original bottle.

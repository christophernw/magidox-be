It can - you start it - maybe you'll start a trend. But I doubt it. Taxation of the wealthy will and does alleviate poverty. But lots of taxation goes in corruption, government workers who don't do any work and other wastage. Ideally, there would be a recognition that the Earth's resources belong to everyone. Licencing of the airspace over a poor country could feed the people of that country - unless all the planes wanted to go around it. Licence the airwaves for TV, radio and cell phones. Licence all the other natural resources and share the proceeds between the most needy of that country. If you are born a citizen of a country - you surely own a share of that countries natural resources - in many poor African countries that includes gold, diamonds, oil and other precious commodities.

Just apologize to the teacher. While you are apologizing, you might mention that your son believes that he is getting unfair treatment due to your mistake. If your child continues to have problems in class, you can go to the principal and suggest that your child be removed from this teachers class.. If the vomiting incident is from alcohol abuse, get help. BTW, most people can smell the difference between vomit with or without alcohol.

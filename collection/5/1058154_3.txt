Pet stores now sell bottles of bitter spray. It's mainly used to train puppies not to chew things but it can be used to correct any bad behavior. Whenever you see the cat scratch the wall, catch him, bring him back to where he scratched and put the bitter spray in his mouth. It will make the cat associate scratching the wall with a nasty taste. The spray is completely non toxic, just tastes horrid... like chewing an asprin.. . Also give it an alternative, if it doesn't have something like a scratching post to use it will turn to whatever it can get it's paws on.. . Declawing shouldn't be an option, it is an incredibly cruel thing to do to a cat. If it's that big of a problem that you would do the equivalent of removing half of everyone of it's fingers then maybe you should find another home for it.

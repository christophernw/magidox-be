Prostitution is illegal because of the people who posted here. They still think you can legislate morality. . . Me--I say let it be legal but not 100% legal. Zone it off in it's own section of town. Make the girls get tested so they stay clean. Anyone who goes to that section of town knows what they are going there for. Anyone else can avoid that section of town.

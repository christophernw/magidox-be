Is the mensa test you took a real one? for example the one that they sent to your house after you payed money or is it one of those online tests that say they can tell your IQ. if you bought it and its official then you have to send the paper in to the address, but if its the online one, don't worry about them, there unofficial and they aren't an accurate representation of yur IQ. The only reliable ones are the real ones you buy or actually take at a site, the online ones are a scam so you can buy things at the end of the test!! Hope it helps

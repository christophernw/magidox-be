it was a war that should of never took place. they didnt want are help to start with but once again we put are nosie in it. so many men died that shouldnt of died. i think we killed more of are own men. there is still many missing. my father was over there. i talked to him to do a report. it hard for them to talk about it they dont want to remember it. my uncle has so many health problems from being over there. adn there own ppl treated them like shit when they did come home. talk to some vets they will tell u about it adn u can get the truth from them. to really get what ur looking for u need to ask those men and women the affects they were there and lived it. for someone to stay there a couple of weeks and try to tell the real fact that wont happen. and theres always stuff they dont want u to know!

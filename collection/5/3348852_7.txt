So what if they are gay, you're not allowed to have teachers of the opposite sex in a locker room with students.. And even if they happen to be gay, why should that matter, not like they're gonna to be interested in getting it on with their students. They could be fired, sued, attacked by idiots or any number of things..  I would hope your teacher has more sense than that!

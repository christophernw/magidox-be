as far as i know its used for DNA figerprinting in electophoresis (i didnt spell that right).  basically you use a gel like substance, put DNA fragments in it (mixed w. dye) and put this in a solution and hook the one end of the whole device to a negative battery side or something and the other end to a positive side and the DNA fragments will seperate and u can use it to match up DNA samples w. people etc.

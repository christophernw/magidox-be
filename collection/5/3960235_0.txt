Hi David...if the medication was applied recently you can try to wash that area off thoroughly.  However, if it's been on for more than 24-48 hours it may already have absorbed into the cat's system and should be seen by a vet very quickly.  The dosage requirement as well as some of the ingredients used to treat fleas in canines are different and can be very toxic to cats.

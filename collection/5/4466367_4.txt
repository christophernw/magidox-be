All of those can be explained by the high intermolecular forces of attraction between water molecules,. namely Hydrogen bonding.. . . EDIT:. No, I do not mean molecular bonding.  The water molecule is already bonded in such a way that it forms a polar "bent" molecular structure.  The Oxygen develops a slight negaitve charge and the two Hydrogens develop a positive charge.  When one polar water molecule interacts with another polar molecule the positive Hydrogens are somewhat attrated to the negative Oxygen side of the other molecule.  This is what is refered to as "Hydrogen bonding".. Because of this very strong intermolecular force of attraction between the water molecules like to stick close together and not evaporate away.  Also, when water freezed into ice, the Hydrogen bonding caused the molecules to align in such a way that there is the maximum attractive forces between molecules, this arrangement takes up a lot more space than ordinary liquid...thus ice is less dense than water.. . This property of liquid water being more dense than solid ice is not unique to water, it is just a rather unusual property.  Offhand, I can think of atleast one other substance that does this, Bismuth.  Solid bismuth will float in a pool of liquid Bismuth metal.

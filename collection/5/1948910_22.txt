Do holding your breath, getting scared or breathing into a paper bag cure the hiccups. For some people, these methods do work. But, if you already tried these and still have the hiccups give one of the following suggested cures a try:. . 1. A spoonful of sugar swollowed dry.. . 2. Suck in and swallow your own breath. (If you know how to make yourself burp on command, it's the same kind of motion).. . 3. Tickle the roof of your mouth with a Q-tip.. . 4. Suck on a lemon wedge.. . Do any of these work? Who knows. The sucking air one has worked for me before a few times, other people swear that sugar is the percent cure for hiccups.. . Notes:. If you have hiccups for more than a few days, you should go see a doctor as it could be a medical problem.

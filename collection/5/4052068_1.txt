None2perdy is right, but perhaps the westward drift of the bullet can be explained in a way that is more intuitive. In order to return to the same spot, the bullet would have to travel outward along a radius of the earth extended upward. But the tangential (eastward) velocity increases as the radius increases. There is nothing to accelerate the bullet eastward to track the radius, so it drifts further and further westward of the radius. The drift speed is maximum at the peak altitude, and continues throughout its flight. This is another example of Coriolis effect, but in a vertical plane rather than the horizontal plane Coriolis acts in when it affects global air circulation and angular momentum. This effect also influences a short jump, but only minutely.

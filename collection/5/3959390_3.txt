Grandstanding....   You mean like Ted Kennedy?  The man who with boisterous volume slams the GOP for their environmental and energy policies, while voting against a wind energy farm proposal 8 miles away from his house.  Or do you mean like Kerry and Clinton who loudly voice their disapproval of the Iraq war, and Bushes policies, but offer no ideas or solutions on how to make it better.  The GOP is working on things it's constituents and voting base believe in.  You don't have to agree, but it is the truth.  Why don't you ask why the Dem's are so focused on getting publicity and face time on CNN, while they should be formulating ideas and action plans on how to make our country a better place for their constituents to live.

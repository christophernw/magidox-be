I disagree with you..but you probably are very smart and well read ..Probably your parents are Republicans and your value system comes from the values enstilled by them....  This is why I disagree:.  I think as a President you have an awesome responsibility. When to go to war and  when not to go to war..... War in Afghanistan;;;Right war ...They housed the terrorsits that attacked our Country,...As A matter of fact...We should still be there and be looking for Osama Bin Laden.... War in Iraq::::: Horrible..they  had an evil dictator as President...But...So does Iran and North Korea...They did nothing to us an because of this war ..Alot of the friend we had on Septemger 12, 2001 ..Think we are crazy today becasue we attacked and now occupy Iraq...... This is the biggest reason I think he is a bad President...He is charged with a huge resposibility...He has killed innocent Iraqi women and children...are their lives not inportant...He has killed 500 times the innoncents in 3 years than saddam killed in his entire tenure as President...then take into account the American Heroes  killed in Iraq...This make him responsible...He chose to invade and now occupy...

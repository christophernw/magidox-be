Depends where you live. In scotland there is no such thing as Deed Poll and all you need to do is inform relevant and interested parties of your name change e.g. your employer, Inland Revenue, your bank, your GP etc. You can call yourself what ever you want in Scotland as long as you are not doing it to committ a fraud.

Isn't say "knowing that the sun will rise tomorrow" a very present kind of feeling--- at 5am when i hear the finches outside chirping and pass out from exhaustion, I go to sleep knowing that it will be light soon. But it's a feeling that we can step outside of... and assess: am I granted to this feeling? so I tell myself a bedtime story about planets moving around a sun and about the accuracy of clocks. And so we feel it-- even more I should think, it is amplified.. and so I go to sleep--- waiting that nightmare that tells me: hahahahaha your knowledge is NOTHING without forgetting~~~~~~~~~

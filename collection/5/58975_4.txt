Will squirrels are a hardy bred of wild animal. You can set out a bird feeder with seeds it and they well go for that. It seems by looking up on the  internet I found that squirrels eat a variety of food from bird eggs, insects, fungi(mushrooms), frogs, and fruit. So really it's nice that you want to feed these animals but they managed to do quite well in the wild with the food around them.

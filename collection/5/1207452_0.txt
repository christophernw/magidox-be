FIRST YOU DONT SMELL OF BLOOD, SECOND YOU CANT FEEL THEM OR SEE THEM IN YOUR TIGHTEST OUTFITS, AND THIRD IN THE SUMMER YOU STILL CAN GO SWIMMING. I WEAR AN ULTRA THIN PAD SO JUST IN CASE OF A LEAK WITH THE TAMPON. I NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS.. BULKY PADS ARE UNCOMFORTABLE, AND WHO WANTS TO LOOK AT A MESSY PAD EVERYTIME YOU GO CHANGE.

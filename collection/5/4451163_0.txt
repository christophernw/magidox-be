They are referring to the component used to put the color in the painting (in layman's terms, what kind of paint it is).  Some general mediums for brush painting include Oil, Acrylic, Gouache, Watercolor, Tempera (fresco), Ink, and Mixed Media.  You can get really specific, but these are the ones that you generally see next to a painting to tell the audience what it is.  It's also helpful when differentiating between certain paintings that might look like one technique or the other to know what medium it is, as they can have constraints that prevent certain techniques.

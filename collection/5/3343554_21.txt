There is no benefit in being an athiest.  You should be asking what are the benefits of being a born again Christian.  The only thing you will get being an athiest is spending an eternity buring in the lake of fire, in agony.  Being a Christian there is so much to look forward to. An eternity with Jesus and the Father, living in glory, in lovely mansions in Heaven.  Seeing your departed loved one who had gone on before you.  Seeing the Holy Angels, the beaty of Heaven, getting to sit on Father God's knee and getting love of him, in his throne room. Living for eternity in glory, with God,,and finally seeing Jesus and the Father face to face.  Amen to that.

Big ones...outdoor...in particular, German Shepherds.  They're beautiful, smart and will protect you.  I grew up with German Shepherds and they are the absolute best dogs in the world.  However, the disposition toward hip dysplasia is not good.  And the dogs really suffer when they get older and the hip dysplasia kicks in.  We had to put down our most favorite Shepherd when he got older because he was suffering so badly with his hips.

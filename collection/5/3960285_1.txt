From my own experience, it wasn't to make life easier when I was a teenager.  It was more from a lack of anything better to do. But we lived in a teeny town with 1200 people and we weren't allowed to drive anywhere else, so that may have something to do with it. . It was also pure curiousity.....but I'm talking soft drugs (marijuana) and alcohol.  We never tried any harder drugs, so I don't know the reasoning behind that one.

I'm glad to see that my cat isn't the only one! She just chews cardboard, but shreds any kind of paper that's thinner. She doesn't try to swallow any of it, so it's not hurting her. It just means I have to clean up her mess. I'm not sure why she does it, but if she's happy, I'm happy.  I just think of my cats as "children who will never grow up"!

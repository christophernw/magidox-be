I have had fairly good results with: 1) Use a very fine "Striping" or "Liner" brush (000 or smaller or works well - depending on how fine of a line you're looking for), Windsor Newton Series 7's work the best; and 2) Try using a "Bridge" (A device that's normally used as a hand support while painting over a fine medium, but that works equally well as a straightedge that's raised above the surface of the work.  What medium(s) are you working with?

Why you continue to regurgitate the same questions again and again, don't you have any new useful questions? The earth to the naked eye is spread like a carpet (translation is not accurate) and this what every body see when look in front on the horizon. But if you are looking from a satellite the view will be different and you will see a rotating ball, and this very nice fact is mentioned very neatly in the holy Quran in 39:5. Now please don't ask this stupid question any more because then you will prove to be very stupid.

Train.  I'm not sure which service you're talking about, but when I was in army basic, we trained on saturdays (to include PT).  On Sundays, you have the option to go to church, and you clean the barracks.  It sounds crappy, but you can't leave, so you may as well train.  Oh, and every other Sunday we went to the shoppette, where we could buy toiletries and stationary.

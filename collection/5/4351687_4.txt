The number seven has deep spiritual significance. It has been held sacred by the Hebrews and other Semite peoples since the dawn of time. It represents perfection and holiness. It is used throughout the Scriptures and in this sense is the Almighty's Number. We read of: . Samson's seven locks of consecration. (Judges 16:13-19) . The seven pillars of wisdom's house. (Proverbs 9:1) . The sevenfold sign of total commitment and dependence (2 Chron. 29: 20-21) . The seven lambs to attest the conclusion of a peace treaty. (Genesis 21:28-30) . The seven fold sprinkling of blood before cleansing was complete. (Lev:16:19) . The seven week count to Pentecost, the seven year count to the sabbatical year and the seven times seven year count to the Jubilee year. (Lev. 23:15, Lev.25:1-9) . The seven candlesticks, seven churches, seven stars, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven thunders, and seven plagues mentioned in the book of Revelation etc.. . I think it simply means seven hundred and seventy seven.

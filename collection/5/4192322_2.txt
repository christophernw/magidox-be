ok..on your camera you have DV in/out...The easiest way to utilize this is to use the DV to USB or DV to Firewire cable that should have come with your camera...once you plug your Camera into your PC, a window will pop open (typically) asking what you want to do...copy to your Hard Drive...open Windows Explorer..etc...in that list will also be Windows Movie Maker...if not go to Start>>All Programs>>Accessories>>>Windows Movie Maker.... . Upon launching Movie Maker you will have a sidebar that begins with Movie Tasks..First selection should be..Capture from Video Device...select that function and begin the import of your video...If it says a device was not found...you may need to check your connection..or some cameras have a special internal mode that must be set in order for your PC to recognize the camera..check the directions for your JVC...once you begin your import...you will see the frames in your storyline at the bottom of the screen begin to fill up with your content...some cameras can be rewound or fast forwarded via the Movie Maker interface...some of them you will have to do this from the camera's controls...experiment and see what you can do.... . Another choice is a thrid party program like Roxio's Easy Media Creator...(around 99.00) or Sony's Vegas Movie Studio.. . More advanced programs like Adobe Premiere can be used to import footage, but requires somewhat of a higher learning curve and cost...depending on what you are attempting to create with your footage...the built-in Movie Maker from Windows XP..should be just fine...

I'm not Rev Trask, nor will I speak for him and place judgement but....  It is so true that some people who really believe in a religion will force it on you and pass judgement when their own religion teaches them not to.  Having a belief that surrounds God is awesome, but don't judge others who don't believe the way you do!  Hypocritical, that's what it is as well when you place judgement on someone when your religion teaches you not to, and hypocrits are what they teach you not to be either.  If you judge a person, you lead to doing something else God teaches you not to be and that will lead to another and another and another thing.

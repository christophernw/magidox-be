Last I heard NAFTA cost millions of US jobs.  The US normally doesn't need a bloc becouse the economy is so huge they do not need help from other countries.  The original debate about illegal immigration was unchecked immigrants bringing TERRORISTS with them unknowingly.The USA is a soverign country.  Are we not allowed to limit the amount of terrorists to bring into our country??

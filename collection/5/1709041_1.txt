Maybe you should brush your teeth more often (min. 3 times a day). If this is not the main reason, you should also brush your tongue and use floss.. Another reason could be some aches with your stomach. If the first thing doesn´t help, you should first ask your dentist and if he doesn´t know, ask another doctor.

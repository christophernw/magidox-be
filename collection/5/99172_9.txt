I do pray for me and everybody else, thats another form of communication with Him. Not all you ask of Him shall be given except for the things He planned to give you from the beginning. If He don't grant you your wish, that doesn't mean He is not there/hates you/ . . If you don't want to pray, thats your choice, don't worry about other pips who finds it good and pleases God to communicate in the form of Prayer.

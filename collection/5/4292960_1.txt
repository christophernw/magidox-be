Soldiers serving in World War I had a great thirst for coffee. But transporting the beans was a logistical nightmare. G. Washington, a Brooklyn-based coffee roaster, responded to the problem by developing the first successful instant coffee. Washington’s crystallized coffee was a huge success with the troops, and by 1918 the U.S. Army had requisitioned the firm’s entire output. During the war they consumed over 75 million pounds of coffee. . . . “During the war, all kinds of names were made up for the coffee that the GIs were getting in their foxholes. Many of them pejorative, such as mud, but it was also known as a “cuppa joe” because of G.I. Joe. This was his coffee, and that’s the origin of why coffee is called cuppa joe. “. —Mark Pendergrast

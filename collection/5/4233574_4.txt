Dinosaurs were extinct long before humans showed up and before they started writing. excavation and archaeology also wasn't around in 100 AD. The age of searching the Earth and discovery is relatively new, historically. People have only recently categorized species of animals into logial ways (taxonomy) and  people have only recently begun to understand fossilization and geologic time. we now understand, through research, that sediments like dirt, mud and sand can cover bones and preserve them (fossils). We are at a time of discovery now that we can trace fossils back to periods of times in earth's history, carbon and radioactively date them, and figure out what time period they existed in. They never had ANY of this technology 2000 years ago and had no way of knowing how to find these remnants of dinosaurs that were buried far beneath their feet. our understanding of the Earth has changed completely, 100 times over since the time of the Romans (when the bible was compiled.)

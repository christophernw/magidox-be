Since the majority of legal Americans are firmly against amnesty,its unlikely that they will be legalized.. But I never underestimate the power of big business here in my country.They will try to force this issue down our throats,to push their own greedy,self interest,the hell with the American worker agenda.. Theses illegals are different that the ones that were granted amnesty before..Theses illegals seem to hate this country and all it stands for.They talk of taking over this nation,they desecrate our nations flag and march in the streets shouting their hate while demanding "rights".. They have angered the legal Americans,that love and respect this country with their blatant hate of anything American.Amnesty will  never happen if it would be in the hands of legal voting Americans.We don't need people that hate this nation to be here .That's a dangerous situation to me.

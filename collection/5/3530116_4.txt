You can get extra strength antiperspirants that you apply at night and wash off in the morning for your doctor. They are hard to use though, as you have to have v dry skin before application and then it takes a while to dry but it can be helpful. If you try it, stick with it. I had to use it every night at first, but then only every week, after that every few weeks and now never.

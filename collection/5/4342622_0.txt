Depending upon the size of the operation and the physical layout of the rooms you will be networking, companies do sell small business systems that you can install yourself.  I worked for AT &T Home and Small Business Division, before they evolved into Lucent Technologies, and we sold several systems that could handle up to 4 telephone numbers, transfer calls between phones, provide intercom abilities, etc.   Check the included websites to see if they will provide the capacity that you require.

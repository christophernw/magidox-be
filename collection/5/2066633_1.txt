If you're that certain, you could hire a private investigator to look into it. If he digs up anything worthwhile, it might convince the police to take a second pass.. . That said (and I know you probably already know this), it was 34 years ago and the chances of anything actually coming out of this are very, very slim. But if you really want to, hire an investigator; do not look into it on your own.

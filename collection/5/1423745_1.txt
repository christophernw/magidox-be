Stop the waste of water by not allowing irrigation farming in places it is unsuitable like the american west. Stop the privitization of water by big companies; water is a right and a neceesity, not a luxury to be made only available to those who can afford it. Start demanding that Mcdonalds and other fast food companies allow there frecnch fries to be random sizes instead of a standard size, which is controlled by the amount of water the potatoes receive. Use composting toilets. Do not pollute the currently available fresh water etc, etc, etc...

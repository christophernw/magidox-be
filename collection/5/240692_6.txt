I have had an average of six or seven cats living at my house since I was born so I like.. pretty much know.. Girls:. Usually more playful, during the day. They're really the tame kind of relaxed ones, and if you're lucky they may have kittens, also they clean themselves a lot.. . Boys:. They're usually the more rugged wild ones. They do a lot of fighting and don't clean as frequently as females do. . . You'll probably be able to tell by these actions but if you still can't, it's safest just to take it to a vet and I'm sure they can tell you. :-)

when you say "negative" what that means is the opposite sign of the number. For example, the negative of -6 = 6 and the negative of 4.5= -4.5. . when you say Inverse correlation, you're talking about a relationship where you simply flip the fraction. for example... 3/4 becomes 4/3, and 5 becomes 1/5.

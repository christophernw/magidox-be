Fish are cold blooded, meaning that like reptiles, their body temperature is the same as their outside temperature.  So, when water gets really cold, so does the fish.  This slows down the fishs' metabolism (how fast they use up food and energy).  . . So, when water is cold enough to freeze, a fish's metabolism is REALLY slow, almost as slow as an animal that was hibernating, so the fish doesn't need much air or food.. . Baisically, the fish is hibernating, but it's because of how cold it is, not because that's when it's internal clock tells it it's time to.

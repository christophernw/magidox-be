I AM FROM THE INDIAN SUB-CONTINET AND THE TERM 'MALLU' IS OFTEN USED TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE FROM A PART OF INDIA VIZ, FROM SOUTH OF INDIA, SPECIFICALLY THOSE RESIDING ALONG THE COAST OF 'MALABAR' E.G. PEOPLE WHO HAIL FROM KERALA ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS 'MALABARIS' OR 'MALLUS'. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THIS TERM IS USED IN THE DEROGATORY SENSE.

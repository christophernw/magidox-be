Buy some nice dinner rolls at the bakery.   Split them horizontally.  Place a slice of turkey and some spread made from one block of cream cheese mixed with half a can of whole berry cranberry sauce and a half cup of chopped pecans.   It is yummy and tastes Wonderful and looks Really Pretty!  To make them even more attractive - place a frilled sandwich pick through the top middle of the mini-sandwich - you could put a small gerkin or olive on the pick first if you want.

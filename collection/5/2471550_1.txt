Odd Thomas. I can't explain it, but there's something about the book that I adore. That, and it's the first book of his where the ending actually surprised me. His others, I usually had a sense of what was coming. Odd Thomas just came out of left field at the end. Wow.. . The sequel, unfortunately, I did not like quite as much.

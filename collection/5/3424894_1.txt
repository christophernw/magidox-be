it's a matter of personal attempts.. I've been suffering with serious panic attacks for a few years.. usually, I'll try to breathe through it, remember that I've felt this way many times and that I was always fine and that I'll be fine again. it took some work, but now they are shorter and less intesnse.. it's still scary, though.. try meditation or, if you still need help, try a doctor.. sometimes you need just a little med for a little white to 'reset' yourself.

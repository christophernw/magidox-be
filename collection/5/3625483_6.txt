If you ask a stupid question you will get a stupid answer.  If you ask something quite serious and not opinionated you will get much fewer answers and the ones you do get are usually good.  It is more disheartening if you ask a real question like how to deworm my cat or how can I fix my garbarator, over questions such as do you think bush is a monkey or why do all liberals smell like what comes out of a dog's rear end.

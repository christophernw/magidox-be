If you were to look at a rubber ball hitting the ground in super-slow motion, you would see the ball deform (flatten) as it hit, then spring back to normal shape.. . When the ball deforms, it is converting the downward kinetic energy of its motion into elastic potential energy.  When the ball is at its lowest (flattest) point, it begins to convert this potential energy back into kinetic energy as it rebounds and accelerates upward.. . An iron ball does not deform nearly as well (!), so will not bounce nearly as high, if at all.. . Note:  It is possible for an iron ball to jump, if the surface it lands on has a bit of "give" to it.  Potential energy would be stored in a way similar to the rubber ball, but in this case it would be the floor storing the potential energy and giving it back to the ball, causing it to rebound upward, rather than the ball itself.

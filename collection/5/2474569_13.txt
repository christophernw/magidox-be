It's all about convenience and saving time in the world now. I appreciate the frustration that you feel though. It's harder to text message or communicate online by using full words, so abbreviations are the norm. Society has spoken, and easier is acceptable now. Eloquence has it's place, but not in everyday communcation I guess. The world's focus and degrees of what's important has dramatically shifted. Slang has just developed into a whole new degree of acceptance. The only thing constant is change. For better or worse is a whole other issue.

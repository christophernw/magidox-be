ok well here is the basic summery.  Well it takes some molecules of trituim and deuturium and shoot them at eachother. These highly unstable molecules shoot out a large burst of heat and recombine the atoms to form helium and nitrogen. It takes a very very small amount of elements to create a huge amount of energy. so it mainly takes molecules and reforms them into a different one. Nuclear FISSION which is used in power plants today can turn lead into gold through radioactive decay. but its not worth the expence lol.

"Official" no, but accepted language is English as the dominant group of settlers were English and historically it was ruled by the English monarch and Parliament, till George the third tried to impose his notorious tax on tea.The French, due to their long-standing rivalry with Great Britain were favourites with the colonists and there was even talk of making French the language of the new state, but this was scotched as there were not too many people who could speak it, whereas those leading the new state were masters of English.It would not be surprising if in the near future Spanish is also accepted as the other standard language with the huge presence of Central and South Americans in the States.I do think, however, it would be unwise to accept more. Speaking one common language is a means of unifying a people and if current and future immigrants are not obliged to learn and become fluent in the historical language of their country of adoption, the necessary feeling of national identity would be at risk.

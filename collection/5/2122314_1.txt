It's the same reason we are racist for not letting them in.  But when they are here, we are the lower class citizens and we are supposed to bow to them.  Mexicans are some of the most racist people I know.  Not only are they that arrogant that they come here illegally, expect us to learn their language, and then treat them like royalty.  Too bad they ruined their own country, now they're here to ruin ours......

Not really much. It is a feature of Democracy that as the democracy matures you will have either two parties or two giant coalition. You are not really left with any other option.. Democracy is thus like a cacus. Take for example Pepsi and Coke. Worldwide they just kill any small palyer and they always monopolise the market. They increase prices by themselves.. Hence no difference of thaught practically. Can you really tell Pepsi or Coke is better. No choice.

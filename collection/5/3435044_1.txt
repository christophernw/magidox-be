You should speak with a local attorney or barrister (in the UK) because it depends on local law where your manuscript is originally published. Copyright is the ability to force action upon others who you want to exclude from using your work for commercial purposes - it will not prevent people from using it at all(there can be legal exceptions).  Basically, you plan a strategy in case someone profits off using your work without your consent.  For example, if you wrote the document in the US, you have a copyright interest once the manuscript is "published" so you can pursue someone.  However, you can further strengthen your copyright by registering your copyright, which then allows some copyright protection internationally but it also costs money.  Again, go to your local bar association or law society to find an attorney or barrister to assist you with a copyright strategy.

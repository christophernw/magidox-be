Because following "evolution" is a lot easier than following God.  God has great expectations for us, a monkey doesn't.  If we claim to come from monkeys then we're just living on instinct (ie. no need to follow rules, morals, etc.), if we claim to be created by God then we should follow His teachings (after all, He knows best).  It takes a strong person to decide to follow God, following evolution takes no strength at all. After all, no one's been persecuted for believing in evolution.  Then again, no monkey died on a cross to give you eternal life. Anyone got a banana????  Also, a frog doesn't prove evolution.  Evolution says that out of an amoeba came a fish which became a lizard which became a monkey then a man, all "different" creatures!  A tadpole is just a frog at it's earliest stages, not a different creature.  A baby in the womb is enveloped by fluid (similar to the tadpole)until birth.  When out of the womb is it now a frog?. . Jeremiah 33:22, "As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so will I multiply the descendants of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me." And again in Genesis 22:17; "blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies.". . When Galileo first viewed our Milky Way galaxy through his 20 power telescope, he must have realized that there were perhaps millions upon millions of stars. Actually there are 1000 to 2000 billion stars in our galaxy alone. Perhaps mankind can begin to realize the absolute accuracy of GOD's Word. I suspect that many scientific men who lived before Galileo's discovery may have totally discounted these verses as being inaccurate. The same is true today as men try to dispute the accuracy of the Bible, only to be proved incorrect later as our knowledge of the sciences increases with time

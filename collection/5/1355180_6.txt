First of all anger turned inward is depression.  I think you are misunderstanding your feelings of anger.  When the depression begins to lift, you will feel happy and sad, and angy, but that is okay, just pay attention to the emotions.  Try to exspess them.  Keep a journal, or see a counselor, or if you need an ear to bend, write to me.  ECREAM9@HOTMAIL.COM

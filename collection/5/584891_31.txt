I think he kills him because Dumbledore told him to. It's so hard to believe that he could just kill Dumbledore like that and I highly doubt Dumbledore didn't know it was coming. Rowling did such a great job always proving that Snape wasn't the one not to be trusted that it seems wrong to give in and believe that he did it just for Draco. I know he's from Slytherin and he puts himself above others but something tells me not to write him off. Of course if it turns out he did just kill him because he was more loyal to Voldemort, then I'll be just as upset as the rest of the HP fans out there that have a glimmer of hope that Snape isn't all bad.

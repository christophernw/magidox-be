There are so many ways to go about homeschooling, and you need to select the best option for the student and the student's family.. . You need to see what is required per your state's laws, as well as what is available.  Options include private homeschooling without help, using a tutor or certified teacher to guide you, schooling through a public charter school that provided independent study or personalized learning, attending an online school, and many more options! . . As for socialization, homeschooled students can participate in more "real world" socialization as opposed to institutionalized and nonauthentic, forced social situations found in typical public schools.  If a student is involved with others who share interests (i.e. art classes, karate, community sports), or in community events or internships, he or she will have a more-rounded social life.

i had this problem a while back. I lot both of my big toe nails. It was because I was in the army and I did a real long road march and my boots pinched my toes. IT caused blood blisters under the toenails and eventually they fell off. They did grow back though, it just took time. It could also be a fungus so if you had no problem before they fell off then you should go to a doctor. If there is an odor then it is a fungus.

SOME people are racist. The usually comes come from unfounded fear and lack of knowledge about others. Some people act racist in general, but when they get to know a person of colour, they soon realize that everyone is the same and We all have the same aspirations and hopes. . . The best way to beat racism is through education. Of course its not just some white people that act this way, as a person of colour, I have also seen my own race act negatively towards others, including whites.. . I live in the Middle East the racism here is far worse than in USA or Europe, especially towards the Filipinos as they do menial jobs. There is a race hierarchy here with the Arab locals at the top, followed by Whites- then other Arabs- Indians, the Bangladeshis and the poor Filipinos at the bottom.. . Some of these people are better educated than us westerners- yet receive a tenth of our salary.. . This will change for the better only when good people of the Middle East do stand up and object to the unfair treatment of other races. . . Don’t give up.  Get to know your “enemy”, the “dyed in the wool” racist. Let them know you are better than them and most importantly, don’t stoop to their level by responding with anger and hurt, its what they want. Learn to ignore them if you have to, they don’t matter to you- don’t let them know they have hurt your feelings

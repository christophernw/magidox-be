I believe it to be one in four, which is 25% of the time, but with respect to Murphy's law, and the probability of improbability even 25% is not completely accurate, as with respect to improbability there always remains the chance that your coin will stand on its edge, and be neither, as I have put this question of yours to the test, and reasoned it out with in my mind, although the probability is not as likely that it will stop on it's edge, it is a true variable, and it earns a variable percentage rate, unless you are not factoring in that outcome and discounting that possibility as an alternative circumstance.. . I have thrown two coin tosses in my lifetime, which have resulted in the coin landing on the edge, rolling, spinning, and stopping on its edge, I apologize for not giving you a more concrete mathematical figure here as to the probability of this outcome, but I have been working on this problem since I read your question and have not completed it as of yet, although if I come to a correct conclusion I will be happy to share it with you.

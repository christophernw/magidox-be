Billions of years ago, about the time Earth was first beginning to cool from its molten state, an object about the size of present day Mars impacted our planet. Luckily this immense object came in at an oblique angle, otherwise none of us would be around today. Debris from that great impact briefly formed a ring around Earth, and then gradually coalesced into the spherical Moon we see today.. .

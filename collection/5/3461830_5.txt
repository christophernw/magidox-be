I don't think so because multiculturalism is out of control.. I grew up in the 50s and 60s went to school with kids from Italy,Greece,Malta and I regard this as part of my culture as a third generation Australian,Aussie Wogs were part of my life,so I am not racist.  The government has ruined a good thing by allowing too many people from too many feuding countries to take away our culture, our  little country can't handle so many cultures, especially ones we have nothing in common with,you can't turn back the clock,our culture is fading fast,we are going to have to find a new one,sadly.

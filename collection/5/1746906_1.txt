A lot depends upon what state you are in, and whether they charged you under statues as felony or misdemeanor. Some stores that can prove you planned to take something would want it charged as burglary and that is a felony. If they go strictly on the value of the items lifted than it is a misdemeanor. So cannot give you and answer without knowing how you have been charged.

Before you spend money on a lawyer, go to the law library in the county seat and ask questions.  It may be a comparatively routine procedure, but it's probably not something they bother to do if you don't file a petition.  It may or may not take a lawyer to do it.. . Lots of legal things are done in standardized forms that require nothing more than asking the county clerk.  You could start there, except that in a lot of cases the clerk's office is more frustrating than the law library.  The librarians are more likely to be nice about answering questions, as long as you are polite.  Don't try to draw them into a philosophical discussion of the right and wrong of it.  Just deal with the procedural matters, and be unemotional about it.  You'll do just fine.  If you feel you are in over your head, then you can hire a lawyer.

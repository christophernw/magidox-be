For a while try keeping the door open with wide sticky tape. Put one end of tape on the flap and hitch it open-they will get used to jumping through. . . When you move on to the next stage, if they are all one side of the flap, put a clothes peg at the bottom of the flap to keep it slightly ajar-easier to push open when they are wary.. . Don't push them through as that will alarm them and they will associate the flap with bad things!. . Good luck!

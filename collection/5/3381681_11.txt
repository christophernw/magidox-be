Religions have failed .... BUT.....God has never failed.. . You say all this stuff about the failure of God/Religion.. how do you know? Did you die and come back to tell us? God said No one will cross back over from death to tell anyone anything. Your mouth is doing a lot of moving but there is nothing coming out to show you are educated on the subject you speak of.  The only ones who know without a doubt about the reality of God are the Dead. . What is your hope in? Riches, greed, what? Do those things fill your soul up? . You have a lot of anger in your tone and I pray that you will meet God soon here on earth before you die. Will be praying for you in the meantime.

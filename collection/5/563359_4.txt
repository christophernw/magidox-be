There's really no way to know for sure until it's too late.  Generally, you can tell which customers are troublesome once they start asking questions, but that doesn't make them a bad customer.  Some people are just a little freaky, the best rule is the oldest one, "the customer is always right, even when he's wrong".  If someone starts a problem, it's usually in your best interest to de-fuse the situation in some way.  This may mean losing a little product or money, but a settlement means you avoid losing business from a bad reputation, so it usually works in your favor.

Don't bash science too much. If it weren't for science, most of us wouldn't be here right now. We'd be dead from simple cases of the flu, or even the common cold. People would die from lack of minor routine surgeries and other treatments. . . Science may seem like heresy to you, and it's certainly not infallible, but it's definitely preferable to having a quasi-literate, chronically sick society that lives like cavemen. . . Many scientists I know are religious people. Faith and science can work hand-in-hand.

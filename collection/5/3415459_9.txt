Because - ignoring the fact that our politicians are ALL greedy, power-hungry swine, and that far too large a percentage are criminals or traitors who should be in prison – they are all idiots who, even if they cared about America and Americans (which they don’t), do not know what they are doing.. . The Repubs are right about one thing, the Dems do not have a plan – for anything. The bad news for America is that by having no plan, the Dems are better for the country because, although the Repubs have plans – they are all insanely stupid, wrong, un-American, and complete failures.. . We are less safe and have less freedom and liberty than when the Repubs gained total control of the government – or, even last year because Bush keeps making it worse every day he remains in office. Iraq, as well as Afghanistan, is a complete loss and we are badly losing a grip on the war on terror.. . Third-world Bozo leaders punk us and our President to our faces and we cannot do a d*mn thing about it because we have no credibility in the world. We have lost friends and made enemies. We have lost our power and influence on world events (except to make things worse).. . They religious and political right are eroding our Constitution (and, hence, government) and destroying our country. We would have been better served by a government that was totally gridlocked. At least when they do nothing, they do not hurt us and harm our country.

Affirmative action has nothing to do with ability, either in high school grades or on the SATs or other entrance exams. I think there was a high court law suit (maybe US Supreme Court) on this topic in Michigan maybe. A White girl had gotten close to perfect on the SATs, her high school grades were straight As, she was in all kinds of volunteer groups, etc., yet the college she applied to passed over her to admit a less qualified Black student. She believed, and I agree, that it was reverse discrimination and/or racism in that the less qualified student was admitted on his race, not on his qualifications or achievements. Affirmative Action in this day and age basically throw ethics out the window at looks mostly at race as the determining factor. I hope this helps.

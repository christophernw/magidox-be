If you don't research the author and publisher of a book, you might reference a book that has unverified information in it.  Good publishers always verify the information in a book that they are publishing.. . Books tend to be out of date, sooner than information you might get on the Internet.  Some books have many editions, and if you aren't using information from the latest edition, there may be changes made that you aren't aware of.

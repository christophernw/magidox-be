Try a good brand of penetrating oil through the spark plug hole first.With the engine secured to a rigid stand and a good pair of leather palmed gloves, try to work the flywheel back and forth to see if you can break the rust. .  Even if you can get it free, there is already damage to the cylinder walls from the piston rings corroding on them. Also, the piston rings are likely corroded to the piston so you wont have a very good seal. I would recommend taking this engine apart and properly cleaning it up. And yes, the piston might have to be pounded out..  Your lucky, I had to do this to a V8 once. I went through a lot of lumber pounding 8 pistons out.

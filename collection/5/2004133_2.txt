Dry Ice is simply a solid form of Carbon Dioxide (it sublimes which means it has no liquid state at normal pressures - goes straight from solid to gas).. . As carbon dioxide is not very reactive and non-flammable, as well as common in air itself, dry ice can be allowed dissipate into the atmosphere.. . However, if this is allowed to happy in a poorly ventilated space, the carbon dioxide (which is denser than air) will sink to the ground and can become a suffocation hazard in large quantities.  So it's best to used it outside, or at least in a well ventilated area.

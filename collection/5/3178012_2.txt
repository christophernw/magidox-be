Hi first of all I'd like to tell u people to understand the question. The person asked why we find bricks in toilets (not in tanks). But, many of gave thinking of tanks. Yes, certain community (as one of our friend referred). I'll specify Muslims as far as I know, use the bricks after urination let it be in toilets or any public places. I've seen my friends searching for small pieces of brick while urinating in public places. They just touch the brick on the tip of the cock. I don't know why they do. Cos, I never asked them and I am not intrested in it at all.

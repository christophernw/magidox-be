Sorry , there is no way to make brown rice into white . .  brown rice is the whole rice kernel , white rice is only the dehusked inner part of rice ( polished ) ..  i like to combine 50% brown and white rice . This gives a good balance of taste and texture in my opinion ;. .  To co lour white rice  brown add beef stock cube to cooking liquid. or for vegetarians  marmite in cooking water .

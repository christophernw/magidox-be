You would need a stiff rubber that could support the weight of the car without loosing its shape and that would be something extremely stiff which would lead to an extermely uncomfrotable ride and would not have any bounce therefore it would not abosrd any of the road hazards.. It would be very dangerous because it would not grip the road as well and at high speeds because of its rigidity you would loose control at the first turn.. when braking you would again have no grip because of the rigidity and would skid even at the slowest speeds.

Both light and sound are transmitted by waves so a wavelength and or frequency for both can be assigned.. . However they are different in two ways:. . 1.  Light needs no medium to allow transmission; it can travel in a vacuum. Sound, on the other hand,  must have a medium in which to travel (air, water, steel, etc.)  Rememer the move Aliens, "No one can hear you scream in space."  That is true because there is no air to allow for sound transmission.. . 2.  Light is quantized (made of photons) so light can act like particles in certain situations.

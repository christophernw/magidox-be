The reasons are various and can be complicated.. . As stated above for some women it is that excitement of dating someone who is dangerous.. . For other women it is a lack of self-esteem and having a relationship with someone who is in prison means that there is an amount of 'control' that they have in that relationship. The man in prison is relying on them emotionally to help them do their time.. . Whatever the reason the letters sent between the prisoner and the partner can be extremely powerful, emotional, poignant and even sexual. They say absence makes the heart go fonder. I can see the reason why when there is a 20 ft prison wall (at least) between 'lovers'.. . How do I know this? I used to work as a prison psychologist!

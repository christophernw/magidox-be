Certification programs do not qualify you to be a pharmacist.  You must attend a Ph.D. program for that.  You can apply as long as you have a bachelor's degree, you've taken the entrance test, and you have all the undergraduate pre-requisites.  There is no need for grad school.  Pharmacy school IS grad school.

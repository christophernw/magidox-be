Uh, what does "free trade" have to do with free services from the US?  What do we get in return?  We pay for all those services plus pay their keep in the prison system.  Can we trade some of our criminals for yours?  Does Mexico let US citizens freely enter their country?  Again I ask...  What does that have to do with "trade"?

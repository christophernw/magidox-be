I would like to apologize on behalf of all the idiots that answered, or thought they anwered, your question. I used to work in the service industry and would get frustrated with the ignorance people would hand out rather than a good or at least decent tip. If you can't afford to tip your waiter, waittress, bartender, etc, then maybe you shouldn't go out to eat. Hm. There's a concept. I'll tell you what, since working in the service industry, I have gone to college and now have a great job that I love. I make probably 10 times more money and don't work 10% as hard as I did as a waittress. In my opinion, everyone should have to do 2 things in life. Serve a minimum of 4 years in the military, and wait tables. I have done both. It really sucks that you don't make the money you want, I hope you can either find a better job or figure something else out. Good luck with everything!. . P.S. If I go out and the service is good, I tip at LEAST 20%. And because of this, people remember me and treat me even better next time I come in. Remember this, people, next time you go out to eat!

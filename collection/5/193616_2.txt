The San Andreas fault in California is a example of a transform, separating the Pacific from the North American plate. At transforms the plates mostly slide past each other laterally, producing less sinking or lifting of the ground than extensional or compressional environments.At transforms, earthquakes are shallow, running as deep as 25 km; mechanisms indicate strike-slip motion. Transforms tend to have earthquakes smaller than magnitude 8.5.The earthquakes are a result of differential movements of tectonic plates.

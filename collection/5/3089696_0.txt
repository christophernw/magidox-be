This farmer was carring his she goat and noticed that the goat had a leak. He placed the goat on the ground and flipped it over to see where the leak was. When he squeezed the leaking niple on the goat it sqirted into his mouth. He quickly wiped it off, but the taste was good so he repeated the process over again and drank some milk. So he went on to tell all the village people about his discovery.

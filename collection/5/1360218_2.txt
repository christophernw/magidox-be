Technically, Dis. Con. is not considered a crime (misdemeanor or felony) it's a violation.  In New York it's a maximum of $250 and 15 days in the county jail.  That of course is highly unlikely.  You're probably looking at $100 bucks and a "don't do it again" with a Conditional Discharge, meaning if you keep your nose clean for a year, it will go away like it never happened.

try using flash cards its helps me alot. I have some problems like that as well. also try relating your answer to something visually, like if your trying to remember multiple things like for instance, boxing-is-knowing-everything means BIKE with the first letter of each word to make something for you to relate it to. so when you think of boxing is knowing everything you will see a BIKE...... give it a try

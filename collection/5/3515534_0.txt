You COULD rip off  the wires and maybe pry off some of the brackets.  Yo'd have a harder time w/ the bands in the back..... . You either wouldn't get it all, or you'd injure your teeth or gums.. . the money issue isn't an issue!   Call the orthodontist who put them on.   Even if they arne't due to come off, s/he is ETHICALLY OBLIGATED to remove them at your request!!. . This is like any other medical treatment!   Let's say you have cancer and you and the docs decide on chemo-therapy.  Let's say it seems to work.  Then, a year later, the cancer returns, and you go back for more chemo, but then decide you just can't handle that anymore and would rather die in peace.  They can't make you continue the treatment.

God knows everything, but He doesn't want us to know everything. That's why all the miracles that He performs are things that are never completely visible. Sure, He can heal cancer, but He will always make sure that we, the people, will never be able to fully prove that He did it. Healing an amputation is just too visible for us normal people. Full proof would be concidered as evidence that God exists, and He can't have that, now can he?. . God also made people rise from the dead, but he made sure that happened in an age when camera's didn't exist. (yet He knew that the camera would be invented later). This all to be sure that it wouldn't get too visible. Actually, God made sure that the big visible miracles kinda stopped after the camera was invented. The only miracles left for Him to perform are the things we cannot catch on camera. That's why He heals cancer, or other internal deseases.. . He also makes sure that when there are cameras around, that we humans still can't prove that it is a visible miracle. The athlete that won the last olympic final at the 100m sprint, he did a little prayer before he started running, and of course he won. God is good in those sorts of miracles. Just to make sure that we didn't get any camera-proof for His miracle, he also made the other seven finalists do the exact same prayer-ritual before they started running. I think God just hates proof.

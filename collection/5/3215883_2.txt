Based on the term alone, I would say it is a tumor (not necessarily cancerous), or some other growth on both adrenal glands.  Bilateral = both sides, adrenal = glands on top of kidneys.  If it is appearing on BOTH kidneys, it seems paradoxical to what you would typically see in cancer.  I'm curious to know for certain what it is, though.

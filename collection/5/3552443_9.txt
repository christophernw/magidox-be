I read all the answers & they are very good.  However, if none of them work there is a mail order place that will make your dogs medication into a liquid form (easier to mix in with wet dog food).  The place is called Pet Health Pharmacy & their phone number is (800) 742-0516 & the website is www.pethealthpharmacy.com your vet can call the prescription into them & they will make the medication into a liquid form.  I know this because I have a chihuahua who has to take medication during thunderstorms & there is no way I can get a pill into him, even if I crush it & put it into food he detects it & won't eat it.  Good luck.

well, try talking to the owner.  Maybe they don't know what to do?!  Try suggesting, having them scold their dog if it barks.  I personally don't like shock collars, because when I rescued my dog, it had one welded to it's neck, but they have other things, like I think there's a spray?  But try talking to the dog, or try telling it to be quiet over the fence, or shhh @ it.  with a little training, it should learn to be quiet.  I just suggest talking with them first.

Many years ago, it was decided that people needed a standard time of day.  They therefore started counting hour 0, at a couple different places.  It was ultimately decided on as Greenwich, England.  Since there is 1 day in an earth rotation, it was necessary to divide the earth longitudinally into time zones.  24 hr days, 60 minute hours and 60 second minutes were agreed upon.  Most of these number decisions were based on the mathematics of 360 degrees in a circle. There is another "imaginary" line in the Pacific Ocean called the Dateline, where the days of the week change.

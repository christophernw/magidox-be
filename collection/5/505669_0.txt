Naw dude, Rocky Road is way too predictable for a life comparison.  That ice cream would have some weird, unexpected shit in it like bat guano and gorilla afterbirth, probably some shards of glass too.  but also some really good stuff, like reese's peanut butter cups and goat cheese.  It would be effin weird.

Because handicapped people love McDonalds. It's an indisputable fact! McDonald's is the handicapped version of Mecca. Every year tens of thousands of handicapped people flock to McDonalds. It's usually sometime in the early fall, it depends on whether or not the handicapped groundhog sees his shadow (it's kind of tough for him with those coke bottle glasses on). Anyway they must visit a McDonalds at least once a year. While their they must eat a fish fillet sandwich, dive into the ballpit, and use the handicapped bathroom.

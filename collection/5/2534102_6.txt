Can you pleaes explain how upstanding black men have to pay for the sins of black men that do nothing with their lives?. . That sounds very Uncle Tom'ish of you. People will succeed because they WANT to, no matter what socio-economic or cultural barriers they must cross.. . As for the black boy, theives reference, that reflects the ignorance of those that use the term.. . In the news, I hear all the time when describing someone (usually a suspect or victim)reference to their race regardless.

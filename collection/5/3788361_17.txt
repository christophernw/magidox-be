Pedigree dog food has a new food formula for excess shedding and you can also speak to your vet it you suspect that your dog is shedding more than normal. Excessive shedding could be a sign of a skin disorder or allergy. Most dog breeds except for poodles, will shedd hair. Poodles do not shed but must be trimmed regularly to keep there hair short. Since poodles do not shedd but continuly grow hair they can be trimmed up into those fancy haircuts one sees most poodles in. Have your vet check your dogs skin and diet and recommend a shampoo. Proper grooming is very important. Shaving your dog will not stop the shedding, it will only be shorter hair that is shed. Brushing your dog daily is good for him/her and you, it is a chance for both of you to relax together and bond.

What lies? The only lie Bush has made was when he said he was going to bed and read a book, when in reality he was boarding a helicopter to start his flight to Iraq.  I think he kept going to Iraq secret because knowing the NY Times, they would have published where he was going, what time he would arrive, where to place the road side bombs and so forth.

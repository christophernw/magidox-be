Well, I know Muslims are forbidden to eat pork. The pig is considered an animal of filth and thus unclean. . . For some, eating the meat of the pig is said to contribute to lack of morality and shame, plus greed for wealth, laziness, indulgence, dirtiness and gluttony. Thus, we insult a person by calling him or her a "Pig" when they demonstrate these characteristics, in folklore terms.

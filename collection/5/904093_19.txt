I think I understand what you mean... One of the consequences of the racism is the fact that people of the same "race" try to keep together all the time, they build businesses together as well as their houses and so on... For that reason, when you find a "muslim" area in the UK a white person would not feel welcome in that part of the city because muslims are expecting to look juts their own race in that place. Anyway, it is so dificult to find a solution by this point, because if you try to destroy those kinds of areas (like Chinatown, etc etc) it would be seen as racism. So the best to do is to respect each area and certainly if you are not part of them and you don't have anything to do in that place dont go! By the other hand, If you want to buy any kind of products there feel free to go but we aware of respect the place!!. Regards!

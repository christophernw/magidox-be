The House is going to have hearings on some provisions the don't like to 'understand' them (and to showcase how bad they are).  Then they will decide if they want to go to conference to put together a compromise bill with the bill they passed in December last year.. . It looks like nothing will happen before the election, earliest, and probably they will have to start over next year.

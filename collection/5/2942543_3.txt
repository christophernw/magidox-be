left of centre is correct. A little-known fact is that if a king died leaving only daughters and a pregnant widow, his eldest daughter would become queen but if his widow had a son, that baby would oust his sister and become king! . . About nine years ago the government promised to consult the Commonwealth countries which have the queen as head of state to get them to agree to allowing for equal male/female succession, but we have heard nothing about it since then and they have probably done nothing about it.

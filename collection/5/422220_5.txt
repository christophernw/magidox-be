You need to consult your vet again.  Your vet may recommend or prescribe a stronger medication and bathing products.  Maggots are found in spoiled meat, are their any dead animals (birds, mice, rats, squirrels, etc.) in an area that your dogs have access to?  They are getting the wounds and subsequent infestations somewhere.  Do they live outside?  If so I would scrub their kennels down with bleach, but be sure to rinse the bleach off completely with A LOT of water before you let them anywhere near them again.. . Good Luck!

I believe that our society has gotten so fast, so crazed, so "gotta do it or die" that simple things like courtesy fall by the wayside. In addition, this do or die culture perpetuates a dog-eat-dog mentality, one that keeps us from seeing the...humaness? or soul or whatever in another. Too busy to live one's own live well means too busy to pay attention to another's, especially how our actions affect others. Kinda like a bad boater who isn't even AWARE that his huge wake wipes out the smaller boats and docks around him. In a word, or three? Lack of Awareness. I would imagine the lack of respect for human life in the U.S. and the world contributes greatly. Lions: 7  Christians: Nothing

Using E10 gasoline which is 10% alcohol (most stations carry this now) will not cause damage to your vehicle.. . Using E85 which is 85% alcohol is not a good idea.  What happens when the alcohol content gets that high is that it absords a lot of water.  Water in turn can ruin the gas tank, fuel injectors, fuel lines and any rubber that is in the system.. Cars that are designed to run E85 have these components made with stainless steel to resist corrosion.

It stunts your growth! ALSO BOTH ARE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE. I know this for a fact. I've been smoking since I was 13 and been trying to quit for the past year with no luck. It is very hard to quit! So please don't start. You're not missing a thing. I started because I thought I looked cool and older. Well you know what I realized, we all look like fools! Be smart! Don't start! I was also addicted to cocaine and it took me years to get away from it, I also lost my health to it. It does alot of damage.

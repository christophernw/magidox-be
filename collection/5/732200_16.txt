Drink some water as you drink alcohol.. . The alcohol its self causes water to evaperaote from your system. causes dehydration, which is what your hangover is.. . When I drink (which isnt often) but I drink like its going out of style, and I have not had but one hangover in my life. the first time I ever got drunk.  since then I geeked my answer on the water, and have not hung over since.  dont drink it by the gallons, but make sure you have enough to not have that dry feeling in the back of your throat.

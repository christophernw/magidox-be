I hate to sound like a broken record,  but what most everyone has said  (already)  is true:  your cat loves you.. . Cats,  as you know,  are pretty good at napping...anywhere,  anytime.  They're professional nappers.. . But have you ever noticed...when a cat is napping by himself,  he'll often pick a spot  that's   off the beaten path,  such as a windowsill,  or the top part of a sofa.  How many other members of your household hang around in those areas?  A cat likes to be undisturbed  (and, in the wild, un-attacked) while he sleeps.. . The fact that your cat sleeps with you   (presumably,  he sleeps ON you,  because you're warm)  means that he feels at ease with you.  Congratulations.  The fact that he's   "in the same room"  with you probably just means he knows that bed time is whenever you say it is.  . . Unless he's really disrupting  your sleep,  I suggest that you let your cat continue sleeping next to you.  He'll keep you warmer in the Wintertime, too!

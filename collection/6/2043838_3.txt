there really isn't anything you can do to 'protect yourself'.  I would just go to the manager again and explain what happened and explain that you really do not feel that this constituted being fired for.  I would explain that you really do not want to lose your job, you apologize and ask if there is anything you can do to keep your job.  If you are apologetic and you let them know that you fear for your job, I think they would understand.. You could also ask if maybe you could be put on some sort of suspension for a month or so instead of taking the harsh action of being fired.

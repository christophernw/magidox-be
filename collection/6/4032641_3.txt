One fundamental difference is that a king may not be a dictator but the emperor is always dictor.Because there still may kings in different countries but they are not dictators but all the emperor are dictors.There is not such history that emperor is democratic person.In this 21st century we can even imagine about those people who are the emperor.In democracy there is not emperor but there may be the existence of the king like Japan, and England.

HIV, or aids is still a "Threat" to the existence of mankind for a couple of reasons. 1st: the AIDS virus mutates and because of this, no one treatment works. The most success has been with the use of several in a combined treatment. As yet, this also means there is no vaccine.. 2nd: the treatments are still very expensive so many cannot obtain them. This is especially bad for 3rd world countries like Africa, where governments may actually forbid the treatment. In many of these cases, folk remedies take the place of medical treatment. One that was prevalent was that sex with a virgin would cure it. The result was an upsurge in rape and the spread of aids in young girls!

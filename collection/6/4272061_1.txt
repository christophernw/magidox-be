The biggest thing I learned in high school was to "DO STUFF." Get involved in things - meet people, learn new things, have fun. Do stuff. This way you'll be busy, but being busy also helps you keep on track - you're less likely to waste time procrastinating, etc when you don't have time to procrastinate!

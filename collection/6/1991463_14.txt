because we are a supper power and as long as there are other people out there that want to lead. which is every country to be realistic then we are going to be hated for the simple fact that we are trying to keep our power in hand. honestly im an Egyptian and i have never seen more hate towards Americans than in the middle east and i hate to say it but it is because there are some Americans that are not educated enough about other cultures and religions that they are scared of them. So why not forces our views and our religion on them and surly they will become like us. But i would have to say i would never want any other country in this world to be like America for the fact that we are hurting our economy and our people when we don't have to. look at china and Dubai especially Dubai there is every possible religion and there is something called respect and education. i got a chance to go and work for an American country in Dubai for 2 years and i loved it. I have never been to a place that had some many religions that are doing SO well economically and socially without forcing people into there beliefs. i agree with you that not all Americans are evil but as long as we keep killing our own men and woman for wars and reasons that are not justified and bring our own economy down why would anyone what to be associated with that.

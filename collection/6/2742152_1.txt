Fan does not always turn just when the car is standing still for about 2min, as there there is not enough air flow for the radiator to work, if the fan does not come on after say 5 min once the engine is warm and the temp gauge is going into the red then the fan or circuit may have a problem, i would not drive it as you could cook your engine

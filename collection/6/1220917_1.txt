There are licensed surveyors all over the country. You may get the details of some of them from the directory, or some good insurance company, and request a surveyor to come to your place, and give the estimate. This will be legally valid.The surveyor will charge you some fee. Obtain a receipt for this. This amount will also have to be reimbursed by the Insurance company.

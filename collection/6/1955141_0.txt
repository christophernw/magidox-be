For water to condense from water vapor, it must generally come into contact with something cold; when enough water has condensed to form a droplet that can no longer be sustained by the air, the drop falls.  The air at the altitude at which rain drops form is MUCH colder than air near the surface of the earth because it is thinner; thus, the rain drop has very little chance to acquire heat from the surrounding air before it hits the ground, and the water droplet is therefore cold.

Energy you cant see or detect, bit silly really.. . It's an excuse for things science can't really explain so they let there imagination run wild and come up with implausable theories. Then using maths they try and prove it forgeting that with an infinite number of numbers to choose from, you can just about prove that black is white.. . I'm feeling a bit scinical today, sorry.

You may be bringing it on yourself.  Examine your attitudes and habits, and see if anything could use sprucing up.. . Or....it may just be your reaction that makes it seem like this.  If you take things harder than others, it may only seem like so many things go badly for you.  Someone else could experience the exact same issues, but if they have a different, more positive attitude, it may not seem like it.

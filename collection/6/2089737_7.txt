woah woah! the original hummer is bad ass! as for the H2 or H3 i could do without. living in the desert i would love to drive a humer around for the sheer fact that i could truly go anywhere. the H2 is truly an over priced suberban it sits on the same frame and suspension. the H3 is a pice of crap that seriously need to be droped off a cliff. it makes you wonder what the hell were they thinking when they made that thing?

I don't like to take meds so my doc told me to avoid cured meats and stress and at the onset try a little bit of caffeine. There were other things too but I can't remember them all right now. The best thing to do is get in touch with a doctor they have a bunch of things you can do to prevent getting migraines as often. I was told there is no cure. Just to prevent frequency and to treat the symptoms. I hope this helps.

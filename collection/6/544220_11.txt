No matter what kind of foreign language that one learn,. the degree of difficulty depends on one's laziness and hard working.. . I am learning 4 types foreign laguage and found that Japanese L most difficult part is grammar, Mandarin is tone pronounce, Arabic is to identified the root word, and English is about prefix-suffix. Those dificulties I realize when I compare with my mothertounge L (Melayu). So the degree of dificulty also depends on your mother tounge L. E.g It will be much easier for U to learn German L compare to mandarin because German L use roman Alphabet and the meaning change does not not depend much on tone pronounce. If U learn Mandarin U need to Memorize thousands of chinese character(Alphabet) and when U speak make sure U use the right tone for each sylable or in no U time will get punch on your face.

A money market account is a form of investment designed to minimize risk.  But to give that low level of risk, the interest rate paid on investments is usually low.  But it very rarely goes down, or goes bankrupt (although both are possible!). . Most money market funds invest the deposits in short term government bonds, and similar investments.  The short term nature and the safety of government backing make the investments very safe.. . Money market funds are also very liquid, meaning easily traded, bought, or sold.  In my account, I have stocks, with any extra cash left over in a money market fund.  Unlike stocks, the stability in the money market means that I can use that money at any time to buy other stocks, or deposit proceeds when I sell stocks.   Stocks aren't quite as liquid, especially when they aren't at a price which I want to sell!

Well, you picked a cotroversial topic.  The problem is, all points about either choice are good.  That is why I choose pro choice.  I can not have another child without dying.  But I have had 2 babies.  Many cannot afford it, many can not handle it and would be abusive.  Many have no brain cells and shouldn't be sexually active.  But ultimately, what do you care what others think?  If you think you need one, you get one.  If you feel it's wrong, don't.   SIMPLE.  Pro choice means any choice, including life.  My mother chose to have me, for wich I am eternally greatful.  But if I got pregnant, I would die, and the baby.  And then I'd be leaving my 2 beautiful boys alone without there mommy.  So it really is not about yes or no to me, it is about why.  Why is alot more cunstructive than yes or no, or religious reasons.  Honestly, do you think of God first when someone flipps you off, or yourself??  And God will not be raising the child, you would.  Pro choice means any choice.  not pro abortion.

Audi is doing good because their quality of competition is decreasing. For example, the only good BMW out is the 3-series, Volvo's cars are getting slower and their reputation of safety is holding up as they used to, Saab's cars are just getting uglier, and overall Mercedes has always done poorly in terms of performance. Audi, on the other hand, always stayed with their commitment to performance and style.

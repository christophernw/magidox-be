I had a teacher in fourth grade that used to humiliate me in front of the class and make me cry just to be mean. she would see if i had a messy desk and clear everthing off with her arms onto the floor and say, "now cry baby, cry." i was actually a good student. she told people not to help me clean it up. she punished me for being left handed and yelled at me when i used my left hand. she made me stay after class numerous times and yelled at me as lous as she could when nobody was around because my handwriting had a backward slant because i was left handed.  she had a mean streak that was purely fascist. it was crazy. i'm 31 years old and i still don't forgive her for that.

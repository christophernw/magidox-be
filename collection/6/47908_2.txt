If you are in PA be careful because if you are not white you are in trouble, and if you came out from PA you are lucky.. It is a nice state but its people are mean and closed minded.. It is called the state of Hicks.. The WASPs in PA called Father's Land, because it reminds them of Germany and there are secret Nazis Groups in PA and the KKK.. It is a very dangerous state no matter where you go.

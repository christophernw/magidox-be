I'd definitely do it by topic because chances are that is how the curriculum will be organised.  Example headings are : Ourselves, Animals, Holidays, Transport, Mini beasts, Environment, Colours, Dinosaurs, Clothes.... . I'd make a display of the books linked to the topic you are studying.  Chances are some books will overlap, so it's your call.  To be honest, organising books in a pre-school could well prove to be a never ending task!  The kids will have little idea of where they got the book from, and, to be honest, as long as they remember to tidy a book away who cares which shelf it's on!

There are lots of meteor shower Web sites out there, but the very best Web site for getting your directions straight and seeing some awesome satellites (including the International Space Station quite often) is called Heavens Above.  Just plug in any location for any time and it will give you superb constellation, planet and satellite path maps.  Note: If you print out the maps, be sure to hold them above you because the printout is aligned so that you hold it above you as you're looking up at the stars at the same time.  Superb data presented in a simple and fun format.

kennel training is probably the most effective. however this takes lots of dedication.  Feed then kennel for ten to fifteen minutes. this will stimulate potty time take her/him out.  reward with love if he goes. if not kennel for another ten to fifteen. then take him out. you have to repete this cycle all day for many days.

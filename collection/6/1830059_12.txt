You are powerful because you have a well equipped army. To be great you need to have done something worthwhile. In recent years the US cannot claim to have done much that could be considered worthwhile. Were you thinking of Vietnam, Somalia, Afghanistan, Iran in your assertion of greatness?. In most recent times people have stopped asking you for help either because they do not like you or because they know they will be very disappointed with your response. Your economy is certainly great and that is why you need to import $200 billion from China last year and then borrow money from the Chinese to pay for it.. Each Empire runs its course and the US Empire is entering the twilight zone. Other bigger Empires will take over the number one spot. The US can then reflect as to whether they achieved great things during their reign. Sad to say they did achieve a great deal but over the last 30 years they have failed miserably.

Good question, and you gave the grade level of the question too!. . Ok, here's what the deal is:. . In order to get a decimal the bottom number (denominator) must be greater than the upper number (numerator).. . When you multiply them together you are multiplying the top numbers together and the bottom numbers together.. . (5/8) x (1/2). . You'd get 5/16 = 0.3125. . Notice how much larger the bottom number is now, compared to either of the ones you started out with.. . You are multiplying larger numbers together on the bottom than you are for the top.. . But what if one of the top numbers of one fraction were larger than of of the bottom numbers of another?. . Notice that the top number of (5/16) is GREATER then the bottom number of (1/2). I did that on purpose to show you that even if the top of one is greater than the bottom of another one it doesn't mater, you'll still end up with a decimal.. . Here's why.. . The LARGEST value you can possibly have is one (1), if not, it would no longer be a fraction anymore......right?. . Notice.....5/16 = 0.3125. . 5/10 = 0.5. 5/7 = 0.7143. 5/6 = 0.8333. 5/5 = 1. . See how the decimal gets larger and larger until you end up with one?. . But the product of the top numbers is: 5*1 = 5. . -and-. . The product of the bottom numbers is: 8*2 = 16. . See how much larger the bottom number is compared to either fraction you started with? This is why the result is so much smaller than what you start out with.. . The product of the top numbers (numerators) will always be smaller than the product of the bottom numbers (denominators).....always, otherwise it fails to actually be a fraction, and the bottom numbers ends up being so much larger than either one of your original numbers in the fractions... . Make sense?

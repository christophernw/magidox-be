Nausea and headaches often caused by way too much fucking alcohol.. Can be identified by the ashtray in ones mouth,the vomit on last nights clothes,the want to never drink or eat again,the great dislike of sunlight, the undesirealbe urge to apologise to all the people you spent the night with, the stranger in your bed and need for a glass of water and many many asprin. . "Where did we go,what did we do, who did we do it with and what did we have done to us?". "Christ my head hurts I've got a proper bad hangover". "I'm never drinking again"

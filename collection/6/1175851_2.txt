An actual paper printed copy that you can hold and file. . . So, if something is only stored on your computer, in a file, it is a "soft copy". . . In meetings, if someone wants to have a copy, they will ask, do you have it in "soft"? meaning they want you to send it to them via computer.  If you only have it in "hard" you have to photocopy it. . . :-)

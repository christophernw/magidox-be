Open a savings account and pay the first 10% (at least) of all the money you make into it. Build up an emergency fund equivalant to at least 3 months of your gross income. This will prevent you from having to sell your investments too soon when you need money. From your bank, buy I-bonds for as little as $50. This will help you build up a starting stake. When you have $500.00 or more to invest contact a discount mutual fund family (Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price among others) to start a Roth IRA. The Roth IRA is a retirement vehicle where you don't get any deductions up front, but it compounds tax free. If your employer has a 401K, participate at least as much as their matching contributions. Go to the library and read about mutual funds. I suggest John Bogle's [Common Sense on Mutual Funds] and Robert Lichello's [How to Make $1,000,000 in the Stock Market Automatically]. Remember, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify. This means you don't want to put everything into stocks.

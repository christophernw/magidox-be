As opposed to ¿qué tal?, ¿Qué pasó? could be better translated as "What happened?"  It almost always implies that something bad happened.  This is why you don't generally use it at the beginning of a conversation.  You would say ¿Qué pasó? if your friend were crying and you didn't know why, for example.

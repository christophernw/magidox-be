It's when you blow up babies. Baby BOOM!!! LOL!.  No. The Baby Boom started when all the Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, etc. that went to WWII came home and started families. The major years of the Boom were 1946 (they worked fast) until around 1955. The boom continued at a slower rate for a number of years after too. Probably do to the Korean War. To say it continued until 1965 is not really correct. I think it's because a bunch of late comers wanted to be included in our generation. Sorry all you Johnny come latelys. You gotta find your own identity. LOL!.  Where did it happen?  In millions of bedrooms around our country. :o) I know it happened in the U.S. (there are 100 million or more of us.) but I'm pretty sure there was a Baby Boom in the U.K., France, Belgium and most of the other countries involved in that war. .  I'm afraid we won't be going away for quite some time yet either. So, you of the next couple generations are just gonna have to wait your turn. Let's just hope that my generation will get some stuff straightened out so you or your kids won't have as much work to do.

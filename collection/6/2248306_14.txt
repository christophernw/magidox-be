As someone said earlier, we have a soul. However, if that answer doesn't satisfy you, then we have the ability to think and reason, and have a moral standard with which we all seem to be familiar at birth, or very early anyway. C.S. Lewis argued this in Mere Christianity. Animals have no such standard, as they will abandon their young, or in some cases eat others of the same kind.

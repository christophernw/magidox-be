I used to immediately say "I'm not interested" and hang up without giving them a chance to say anything or ask them to hold on for a second and just lay the phone down and walk away.  They get the point then.  Now, there's a state law and I'm on the "No-Call" list, so I don't even get those calls!  Sweet!!!

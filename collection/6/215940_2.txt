well, if you get up there and mumble and don't have your thoughts organized, everyone will know. no one wants to listen to a speaker who isn't prepared, it's not interesting, or informative. if a speaker is stumbling over words, the audience is going to assume that the person giving the speech doesnt know what he/she is talking about.

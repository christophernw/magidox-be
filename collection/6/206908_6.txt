It is not social values that factor in for the use of drugs, it is stupidity, ignorance, and a woeful desire to ruin oneself. People of all walks of life with no brains in their head will try drugs." I won't get addicted",(denial); " I know what I'm doing",( ignorance), ; " I didn't know what it was", (stupidity). Come on now, I used to get drung, alot, but I never drank poison or tried to eat a hot coal. Don't label a user by social values, they come in all sizes and shapes, rich or poor, with or without families.

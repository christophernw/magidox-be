The answer given by "The chemist" was excellent.. . Atoms have equal numbers of protons (+) and electrons (-), causing the overall charge on the object to be neutral.. If the atom did not have a neutral charge, it would not be an atom, it would be an ion.. . Example:. The Potassium atom is symbolized K, and contains equal numbers of protons (19) and electrons (19).. The Potassium ion is symbolized K+, and contains 1 less electron than then number of protons within the nucleus.

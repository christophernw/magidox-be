Physics are determined by the following:. 1)W (Weight) equals combined weight of both passenger(s) and the bobsled (W= mass*accelerationof gravity - or just put the peeps and the sled on a scale). . 2)Theta = Angle of the slope of the track from horizontal . . 3)N (Normal Force) = Part of Weight perpendicular to surface bobsled is travelling on. = W * cos (Theta). . 4)k (Kinetic Friction) = Waxed Wood on Dry snow = 0.04. . 5)Fk (Frictional Force) = The force that is working against you donw the track slowing you down = k*N. . 6)Fnet (Net forces) = Forces due to weight on track = Wsin(theta) - Fk.. . 7)Anet (net acceleration) = The acceleration MAY be negative which means the slope of the track is too shallow, the bobsled is too heavy, or our passenger(s) need a diet. = Fnet/W. . 8)Vo (initial velocity) = Initial speed the bobsled crew imparted on the bobsled the second before they hopped onboard.. . 9)D = Track distance. . 10)T=time to get down the track= preferably very fast or no gold! . . 11)Vavg = D * T. . 12)Vfinal (Hopefully the bobsled is fastest at the finish line or someone needs to go on a diet!) = Anet*T + Vo. . 13)Vavg = (Vo + Vfinal)/2 = D*T. . As you can see, you need to determine what you are trying to find - then plug and chug.. . . 2) Friction coefficient of snow/ice

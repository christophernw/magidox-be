My opinion about Rockford Fosgates they are the best but the new Rockfords are ok.  They are not as loud as the older style and the older subs. The older models could not be beat'n befor Kicker came out with Subs I know because I have a Pair of 12" Rockfords to where the sound vibration is to much for my car i got tired of replacing my rear windshield once a month so I decided to run them in the house now it feels as though I am in an earth quake from hell so if you choose Rockford you are making a very wise choice.

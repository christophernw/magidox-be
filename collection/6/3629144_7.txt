hmm lets see, the God of love, mercy, forgiveness... this the same one that can't forgive gay people (unless they repent of course), can't forgive those who deny him?. The one who frequently wipes out millions of people through starvation, illness, natural disasters?. The same one who loves his people so much that he creates disease, glorifies the stoning of people, promotes genocide.... . Well it's no wonder so many people follow the sensible path to atheism. It doesn't really help your cause when you consider the many contradictions in the holy books. . . Then if you follow that up with the non-existant 'proof' that God created everything and the idea that there is an invisible man in the sky, it doesn't really make religion all that attractive.

Not sure if this is a weird job but ... I used to be a caddy.  Not the car, a guy who carries golf bags.  It is a dying profession.  If you've ever seen the movie Caddyshack there is mention of a caddy scholarship.  There really is such a thing, this is how I went to college.  I have recently been asked to sit on the selection committe for the next academic year.

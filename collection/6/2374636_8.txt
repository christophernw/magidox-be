Errr sort of, as whole a very trust worthy organization, contracts are signed and most leaders are pretty good. However always keep in mind that the mission comes FIRST and orders are orders.  So yes you might have a contract that expires on such and such a date but Stop Loss may be activated.  Or you might be promised leave (vacation) but then mission comes up and you're called back.  . . All in all the Army tries to keep the soldiers as happy as they can, heck the soldiers are all volunteers, and faith/trust in the organization what keeps them in it.

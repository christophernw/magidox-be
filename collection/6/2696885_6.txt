When you consider our evolvement, really, we haven't been here long enough yet to be considered "civilized".. . Oh, we have advanced a lot in the short time we have been here, granted, but come on, we are still in the infancy stage of development.  What is to come in the next 100 years would amaze us I am sure.   Look what advances we have made in just 50 years. . . Why haven't we accomplished peace?  Some places we have, but there are still people living on this earth that are no more developed than they were 100 years ago.  By choice, too, because they aren't ready to change the way they are.  How things are is how they have always been, and that is the way it is supposed to be.  That is their basic philosophy and while it doesn't seem feasible that this kind of belief could be, consider the fact that they have never seen a television, a computer, or anything else that we take for granted every day.  They are still primitive in ways we can't possibly imagine.. . And as a result, there is going to be violence.  That is normal to them.  A way of life.  So it is not hard to understand the failure of us to accomplish world peace.

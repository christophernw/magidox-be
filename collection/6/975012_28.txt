I used to be in the same place as you i hated to go to school. i hated to go play out side, didnt have friends cause they were all racists. I know how you feel. Till i moved. My grandma is and i hate it, my b/f and his mom is and i hate it i tell them stuff cause of it. But you can change a person once there like that  i wish . it would take a strong person to do that. But to answer ur question. Its hard to give advice not knowing how they are makeing fun of you. Do you have any brothers or sisters? Do they do that during school? What do your parents say about this. If u have the guts tell them somthing and see if they say something to you. There should be someone around there that will not see you cause of ur race. I am white, and i live all around hispanics, my b/fs family is all hispanics, and when they have parties, i feel so uncomptabel cause they dont like "white people", but they deal with it and all i do is find someoen to talk to like his sister or his nesses or nefues or cousins, sometimes they tell them to stop playing with me. But i dont know, if i were you this is what i did, i todl them stuff. well it made them mad and she told her mom and i got introuble. So then i told my dad about it and my dad when to her parents and told the kid stuff cause of her being that way to me and she got introuble and the next couple of days me and her were getting to know each other and now we are still the bestest friends in the wrold. lol its funny how it all starts out to be like huh?  Good luck.! hope i can help.

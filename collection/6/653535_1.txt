W/ that much money involved, certified mail/acknowledgement of receipt or some such should be involved. Ask the credit card company what their procedure is and follow it exactly. Point out to them you cannot prove a non-existence. Request they push the small company to provide evidence of shipment and proof of delivery.. If requested shipment without such, you hare no basis for a claim. I'm sorry.

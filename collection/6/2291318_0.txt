Their existence has been postulated, but more often in science fiction than in actual science.  Some suggest that quasars (which are extremely bright) are actually white holes, and that white holes are possibly connected to black holes via wormholes.  But white holes seem to violate the second law of thermodynamics, and therefore probably do not exist.

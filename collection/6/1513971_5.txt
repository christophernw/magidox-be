I'm not sure that I understand what your question really is?  Are you urging me to believe that cops 'go by the book'?  I've been treated very well by cops..usually.  But I at least had enough sense not to call the station to complain about the situation.  What exactly was the complaint the released guy made?  "Drunk" is a major charge..."disorderly conduct" is minor.  If I'd been released on a 'drunk' suspicion, you can bet that I would NOT call to complain about it.  :-)

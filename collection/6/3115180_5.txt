In keeping with you're question to stir the pot.. I don't know why we have an Army or Air Force. The Navy has it all. Submarines for undersea, ships for on the sea, Naval aviation for the sky's and we own the Marines for the land. Back when you actually got a pay check, a Marine's check would say, "Department of the Navy". . It takes a whole battalion from the army to equal one expeditionary force of Marines, and the Air Force is like Swiss Air, a government subsidies airline.. . All in fun my comrade in arms, it takes the whole team to do what we do worldwide, from the war on terrorism to building schools and digging wells in Africa.

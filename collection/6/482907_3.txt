Without costing you about as much as a new porche or Corvette or more.  Basically  if you want to shell out a house or expensive car to fix your teeth, then maybe they can fix them, but remember, it isn't guaranteed to last also.  So you might get them fixed and then two years later after spending $50,000 to fix them, you still might need dentures.

You can't talk someone into it, or use an ultimatum. That simply is not fair, and at best it's unsupportive.  Try not to nag at him, and use information to kind of "remind" him of the dangers to his health. Examples are getting brochures with pictures of cancerous lungs, and pamphlets about the dangers of smoking, statistics, etc. Just leave these laying around  where he can read them without being put on the spot or pressured. Only he can make the decision to quit, and it will be tough enough, so be loving and supportive, even if his first few attempts fail. Good luck and good health!

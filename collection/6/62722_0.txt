Because all ur senses play a part in what u put into ur body, 'cause once it's in there, it's too late, and if u know u'll spit it out, why bother putting it in there? Sight is an important part of what people do with other parts of their body. Like, if u saw an ugly shirt u probably wouldn't buy it, but if u saw the same shirt in a pretty design, u would buy it. It's the same thing with food; if u don't think u'll like it based on how it looks, u won't want to eat it, because the assumption is, if it looks ugly, it must taste bad, even though, it's oftesn the  other way around. That's why when u go to resteraunts(or diners), the food is arranged on ur plate in a nice way, so then u'll eat it before u send it back.

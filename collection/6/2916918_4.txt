What the hell do you know about Israel or Palestine?!?!!. Get fully informed then start judging FIFA and Yahoo .. Everone is always on Israel's side, so what if just ONCE someone decided to be on palestinians side?! is that too much?!! i don't think so!!  . . stop using such strong words like "Anti-semetic" BS to make a bigger deal out of it! Besides, despite what is commonly thought  anti-Semitic doesnt necessarily mean "anti-Jewish"  ..  not all Semites are Hebrews. (Both Sunnite Arabs and Jews are Semites) .. so palestinians are ALSO SEMITIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

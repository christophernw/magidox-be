Until parents quit abdicating their responsibilities to schools and return to raising their children crime will probably continue to escalate. Punishment for crimes is not much of a deterrent because no one commits a crime with the idea they'll be caught. Public hangings in the 1800's offered public entertainment but didn't do a lot to prevent crime. Punishment of the adult offender in today's society doesn't prevent crime it just takes away the opportunity for the person to repeat his or her crime..  To change society you have to start with children at an age when you can mold values, a concept the Germans figured out in WWII, then as they become adults they carry these same values with them.

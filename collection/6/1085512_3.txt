The most obvious downside of owning versus leasing is the monthly payment, which is usually higher on a purchased car. Additionally, the dealers usually require a reasonable down payment, so the initial out-of-pocket cost is higher when buying a car.. . The website I indicated below gives both pros and cons of  both options. When I was in business, it was cheaper and more cost effective to lease. Tax breaks etc. The only problem we had with leasing was the limited miles available.. . Good luck.

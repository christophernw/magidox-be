If you filed for Chapter 7, it will stay on your credit report for 7 years.  If you filed for Chapter 13, it will stay on your credit report for 7 years after you have made your payments and it was finalized (usually for a total of 10 years).  IF the BK is older than that, then send a dispute to the credit reporting agency.  You can still try to dispute it before that time, but chances are you will not be successful in removing it, as it is a part of public record and as long as it is a part of public record, the CRA can verify it without a problem!

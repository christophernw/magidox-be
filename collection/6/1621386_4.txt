I use clarinase because clarityne doesn't work for me.. i think it basically depends on your body's reaction to the drug.. all it does is release an anti-histamine to stop your histamines from reacting with the allergen.. . one way is to find out what you're allergic to.. if it's pollen,grass etc, try to keep away from them.

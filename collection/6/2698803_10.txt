Easter, as celebrated with colored eggs, bunnies, flowers, etc., is a carryover of the pagan festival to the goddess of Spring/fertility, by the name of Estarte or Esther. (I need more reference material here.) She was one of many dieties the pagans worshipped.  Pagans were people who created their own gods out of stone, wood, whatever, and party'ed on.. . The word 'Easter' is not in the Bible.  Jesus' rising from the tomb may have taken place in time proximity to the Spring festival and so has been intertwined over the centuries, representing new life, hope, etc.. . There is only one thing Jesus asked be done in remembrance of Him, and it was asked of his apostles at His last supper with them, just before he was removed from them and taken before Pilate.  He did not request it be done annually, daily, every Sunday.  We assume.. . Luke 22:14-19 . 14 When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.  15 And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.  16 For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.". 17 After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, "Take this and divide it among you.  18 For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.". 19 And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.". . This was the evening before he was crucified.  Matthew, Mark and John each speak of that meal with Jesus, but do no quote him as saying 'do this in remembrance of me'.. . To choose one day of the year to celebrate the new life Jesus represents is to lose sight of his being.  Everyday is Easter, new life, hope when he is in your heart.  . . The up side is that there are some people who only go to church twice a year; Christmas and Easter.

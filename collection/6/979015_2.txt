Hold the tool with one hand in front of you like a sword and hold the knife with the other hand.  Starting from the base of both (cutting edge of knife looking to you), just run the knife along the tool away from you (it is safer) while you pull off the knife to the right, the whole cutting length of the blade must run througout the length of the tool.. Repeat each side of the blade alternatively (up and down the tool) only 2 or 3 times, it is best to do it only a little but more often, you will keep your knife longer.. Dont give too much pace because knife are rather fragile against these sharpeners.

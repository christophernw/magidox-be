The "Church" is really the Born-Again believers in Jesus Christ who died on the Cross and was raised from the dead by the Father above.  Down thru the years, that name "Church" was transferred to a building, of which it is not.  No matter where you are on Earth, no matter what building you are in, if you (a spirit), have been recreated by asking Jesus to come into your heart and save you, then you are part of the "Church", and the Holy Spirit now lives in you, cause God don't live in buildings or boxes anymore, he lives iside of people (the Temple of God).

It is not okay for any one to use this ethnic slur!!!. I don't approve of the word usage of the N word at anytime,anywhere, or by anyone. . The N word was used by the Caucasian to DEGRADE African Americans in the slave days.. I do not understand how African Americans use this word in music and as a way of recognizing a fellow friend. . It is derogatory and I wonder to myself what would there ancestors think to hear them using this shameful word as a greeting?!! Its an outrage its disrespectful and only the ignorant can try to validate its use!. . . . Good copout   PrinceOff .....but the word was and always will be derogatory and yes it was the close minded hatred of the the Caucasian ancestors that brought on this ugly word.READ ON>>>>. .  During the period in America's history when black workers were shipped to America to work as slaves, this word came to be adopted from the hispanic South American languages to describe a person of dark skin. Essentially, a "negro" person simply means a "black" person. Through constant repetition of the Spanish word in the American accent, it seems likely that the word was corrupted from "negro" to "niggero" to simply "nigger". The term "nigger" has taken on perjorative qualities as it implies not only darkness of skin, but a general lack of intelligence and sophistication. At the time of the word's origin, various English speaking North American settlers who set cultural standards considered black people fundamentally inferior and less civilized. The term is generally considered offensive to black people not only because it singles them out on the basis of their skin colour, but also, because of its origin, it carries connotations of slavery, inferiority and oppression

It's called a turnpike because it either is or used to be a toll road.  Because they did not have electronic toll collection systems or guard rails back then, they would prevent people from passing until they paid the toll by putting a pike in the road.  Then, to allow the car to pass, they would turn it.  Hence, "turnpike."

I also would suggest that a good source for dealing with personal debt is Dave Ramsey.  Try out his radio show (either in your market or on his website - www.daveramsey.com).  He has a knack for motivating people to take action and "getting radical".. . I followed his advice and paid off $19,000 of credit card, student loan and car debt in a little over 2 years.  And I never paid him or anybody else a red cent to do it.  He has books available to buy but the plan is more motivational than extra-practical.  Basically, slim your budget to essentials, divide your debt, and conquer by paying off the smallest balance first and rolling the payments into the next debt, etc.. . Good luck and don't get discouraged!!  The key really is getting a single-minded motivation to knock the debt out.

They do not worship her. Yes she is a wonderful example of what we should do. BUT. As far as intercession, I have this against Catholicism. Romans 8:27, Romans 8:26, Hebrews 7:25. Those verses all have one thing in common. He makes intersession for us and only He in the Heavenly realm. As far as on earth we can make intercession for one another i.e. 1 Timothy 2:1, but in heaven that role is fulfilled. . . When I use He it is implied that I am revering to Christ Jesus, and His Holy Spirit.. . Edit:. Well Actually the Princeton Word.net defines Worship in the noun form as - a feeling of profound love and admiration, and as a verb - love unquestioningly and uncritically or to excess; venerate as an idol. So I guess by Catholics own admission they do.

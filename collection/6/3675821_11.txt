Unfortunately political concepts don't evolve like a society and it's communication technology (especially on a world level).  Our and most other political systems are archaic, and favor an equaly as archaic status quoism. With todays communication capabilities we could easily make do with one fourth the government control and one tenth the "legislative representatives".  A true republic Of the people  By the people, For the people is now possible, but you won't see that on the evening news..... . The concept of voting on decisions is long overdue, and strikes fear in government participants, bureaucrats, and their media toadies.

According to Newton's third law, gas, water or any other mass ejected by a spaceship produces a thrust. But in the specific case of the Space Shuttle hydrogen cells, I suppose the thrust is small enough to be negligible for operating the ship. Indeed, you have to consider that the quantity of water, and its speed are very little compared to rocket performances. Probably this water is cause of small asset deviations that have to be compensated real-time to maintain the nominal trajectory (i.e. it's more a problem than an advantage).

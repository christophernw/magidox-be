Marijuana, like alcohol, can be addictive as well as mind altering.. . Just because alcohol is legal does not mean other addictive or mind altering substances should be legal.. . Why? Because for the health overall of a society, the people in that society have to draw a line on PRINCIPLE as a way to knit together people around more, rather than less, productive consumption.. . Even if the government legalizes marijuana usage, and the usage goes up by double - the damage is not so much the doubling of usage, but the fact that something that is harmful to people is endorsed by the government.. . Look around you at the people the smoke a lot of pot. Sure, a few of them might be functioning successes, but most are barely employed or financial messes or limiting themselves with their addiction.. . Pot is also a very addictive substance.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism. . all Christian religions practise intercessory prayer...confession is just the way Catholics do it....in other churches it's called ''prayer chains'', etc.  Jesus meant for us as Christian siblings to lift each other up in prayer....it's called the ''Power of Prayer"..there is some ''over-ritualism'' in Catholicism & some get caught up in this & get distracted from the real message/redemption of Jesus Christ, but there are stumbling blocks in all Christian denominations obviously because Satan is at work hard in Christianity....it is His sworn enemy, but to call Catholicism a false religion is just ludicrous.

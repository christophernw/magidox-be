You can't.. . While some people are easy to say that they are, some other are not, even they behave even more as a male than straight people himself, to be gay is matter of attitude, very personal and no to be showing so, many gay people are happy by being treated as straight, and in the intimacy still behave as their gender, while other straight people enjoys making fun behaving as gay people, and that doesn't make them gay, right? So once again I tell you, you can't tell by sight who is and who isn't gay most of the times.

PINKY TOE is correct.  It sounds like some one has inhaled some how a poisonous derivative of phenol, often released in gases from a volcano or a derivative of the drug BENZINE.  This is very acidic and can cause dammage to internal tissues of the body.. . Inhaling it would automaticly cause dammage to the soft tissue in your nose, bronchial tubes and lungs.. . OUCH!. . I hope you or some one else who is suffering from this gets better soon.. . Don't worry.  It's treatable.

Maybe you need to offer him an incentive.  Once I wanted my hubby to drink a glass of chocolate milk, (he only drinks pop or water, PERIOD.  I told him that if he tried it then he wouldn't have to get me a birthday present...Cheapskate did it.  Still won't drink milk, but now I know he at least tried it!

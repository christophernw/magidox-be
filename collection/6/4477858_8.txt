One reason there's no fat people is because the commericals are filmed in a fake McDonald's. I happen to wander into one, they are closed to the public. Like I said before McDonald's is not in the business of providing good food to eat, they are in business to make money. I can remember back in junior college I was taking business classes and the manager of McDonald's came to talk to us. One student asked why don't you put tomatoes on your hamburgers? The ans. was that it would cost them half a cent more !!!

I believe it, but you have to take into account that is was written from someone's perspective of how things were. There is a lot of symbolism used and that can get confusing. I took a school trip to Israel and saw a lot of the history that is described in the Bible for myself. You can't just believe that parts of the Bible are true and parts are not true, because that brings the whole thing into question. The Bible has great truths and wisdom. Whether or not you believe it's truth depends on the amount of faith you have in your beliefs.

That would only happen in a true democracy, which is NOT the system setup by the US constitution, depite the over-use of the word.   The USA is actually a republic (think back to school days...  "and the republic for which.." ?), and that's how republics work.. . Note that I'm not taling about Republican and Democratic policicians, but the systems of govenment using those names...

When asked about his play on the last day at Augusta, Woods replied: "I putted atrociously today. Once I got on the greens, I was a spaz.". . In several countries, "spaz" is an offensive term for people affected with spastic paralysis, a form of cerebral palsy.. . Britain-based disability organisation Scope, formerly The Spastics Society, said of Woods's comments: "Once again, Tiger Woods demonstrates that we are two nations divided by a common language.. . "Although in the U.S. the term "spaz" may not be as offensive as it is here in the UK, many disabled people here will have taken exception to his likening a golf stroke to that of 'a spaz'.. . "UK disability charity Scope is confident that Tiger Woods would be devastated to learn that something he said could offend his fans, disabled or non-disabled.". . Wood's remark drew little attention in the U.S. where "spaz" is a slang term for someone considered clumsy or inept.

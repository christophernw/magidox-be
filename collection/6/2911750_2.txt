There are several areas of our bodies that are considered mucus membranes.  The mouth, ears, and nose are a few of those.  These membranes secrete mucus from special cells called goblet cells.  The mucus serves many functions, but in the nose, it is very thick, because A) keeping the nasal passages moist is crucial and B) there is a lot of dust and stuff in the air that we don't want in our lungs, so the mucus traps it.. . When your nose does start to get dried out in the front of the nasal passage (where drying out due to evaporation is most likely to occur), the mucus that was in there becomes hard and crusty, giving you the classic booger.

Remember, if you always do what you always did. You'll always get what you always got.. . You may need to check out a life coach, or pick up a good book on the subject. Right now you're in a circle and you can't break free.. . Much like a dog chasing his tail. Stop and look around, see what you are doing and change it. If you do your best, you'll get the best.. . Good Luck

Exercise works better than anything.  Unfortunately, depression can immobilize you enough so that you can hardly move, much less exercise.  Try forcing yourself to do more each day.  Also, consider taking medication and then study and read about things you can do life-style wise to help and adopt the advice as your are able to.  Once you are taking positive steps to keep depression at bay, start weaning yourself from the meds.  I hope you start feeling better soon.

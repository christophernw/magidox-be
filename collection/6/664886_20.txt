What ? I've said on numerous occasions we would be better. off with out "most" formal religions : they need some serious redrafting to deal with an educated world.And I've said positive things towards the good part of Christianity too ! I just don't believe that  a christian tag makes it's so.....Others I can't . or at least refuse to speak for..... peace out  follow Christ not his exploitation....

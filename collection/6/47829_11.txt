You're right about the temperature based solution. All you have to do is warm up one of the glasses, and keep the other one at a cooler temperature.  This can happen by placing the glasses outside, one in the sun, and one in the shade. Or perhaps boil some water and dip one of the glasses in it. The hot glass will expand due to heat, and will push itself off of the other, cooler glass.

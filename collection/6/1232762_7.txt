The London underground is not a load of shxit. It is one of the most respected rail net works in the world. And acknowledged as such by surveys carried out by foreign countries. In fact the whole of the London Transport system has even outvoted NYC, Madrid, Paris as being the best in the world.. . Sorry that you had a bad experience last night and I just glad I was not there too. But in the grand scheme of things what you had to put up with is minor don't you think?

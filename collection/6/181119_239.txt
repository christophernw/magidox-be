A great summer job is a job that you love.  Particularly something that helps other people.  When you help other people, it feels good.  I also depends on how old you are.  You should be indoors, or in a pool, if you're a swimmer.  You should stay cool so you don't hate your job, and find one that can lead you into a new career or give you insight on your future.  Not a trash guy or McDonald's janitor.  Find one with a good environment, too.  It depends on how you feel.

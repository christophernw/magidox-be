Work up to it...I started walking from my home to a convenience store and back (about 3.5 miles round trip)...when the walking got easy, I increased the pace...when that got easy I started walking a block and jogging a block on my way to the store...then it was walk/jog the entire round trip...then I jogged across the cross streets too, not just the sidewalk part of the block.... . ...and so on...as you get fairly comfortable doing "x" then add a little more so you are putting forth more effort...when that gets easier, then jog a little more...and a little more.... . Good luck!

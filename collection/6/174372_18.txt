What Peter is saying here is the process to recieve the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, First you ask for forgiveness then you get baptized with water in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost then you are able to recieve the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Being baptized in water is to represent the "old man" being buried and the "new man" raising up changed and it is to make a public confession that you have been saved. Does't mean you have to be baptized to make it to heaven its a work that is needed to be done if able to.

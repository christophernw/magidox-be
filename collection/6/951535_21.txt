I just finished off a bottle of tap.. . I drink tap more than anything else (I had the bottle from a purchase I made while on the road. I usually keep them for a little while). . I don't see why people prefer bottles over tap (except for reasons above).. . Let's see...$2 or FREE, which do ya choose?. . (This does not apply to those who get well water. YUK!)

One of the basic features of language is that it changes over time as people speak it.  Americans that came from England spoke like Englishmen of their particular class, but then they became isolated from England and both groups of people had their language evolve, but in different directions.  Similarly, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romanian were all originally Latin,and the "accents" and dialects became totally different languages.. . Mass communication, like television and movies probably slows this process down a great deal.

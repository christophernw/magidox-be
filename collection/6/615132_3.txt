You do not use a hoop for needlpoint.  Hoops are used in embroidery which is done on fabric.  For needlepoint you use two rollers and two side bars.  There is fabric permanently attached to the to the rollers and you baste your canvas to that.  You then attach the side bars and by rolling the canvas you can maintain the tension on your work surface.  . You should be able to find this apparatus at a craft store that carries needlepoint canvas and you might also want to pick up a beginning needlepoint book.  good luck

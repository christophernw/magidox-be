Because coming onto someone's personal property to try and manipulate their spiritual views is invasive. You are most likely not the first person to do it, you won't be the last, and it's annoying. Most people are satisfied with their spiritual choice, and if they are interested in another aspect of spirituality/religion/whatever, the information is there and they will go to it if it's made readily available. Knocking on the door of their personal space and forcing them into a confrontation of personal interests is uncomfortable and people try to avoid what is uncomfortable.

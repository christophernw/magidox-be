I went away for a few months and my cat became very depressed and stopped grooming herself. Her fur became very matted (which can be very painful) so I took her toa professional who shaved her. Her hair grew back quickly and beautifully. . . If you can't afford a groomer try Johnsons&Johnsons baby detangler, but make sure you wash it out completely.. . Make sure you brush them at least 15 mins a day.. You should also ask the vet if these are signs of depression since you did mention they just lost their mommy.  Just a suggestion.

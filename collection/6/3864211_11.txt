Clean up the dog poop from the yard right after they poop.  That removes the "temptation".  They call it 'forbid' when dogs do this.. My young lab does this once in a while and if I scold him, he usually drops it.  I keep their yard clean and then it doesn't happen.  I think about it when he licks me, which is all the time. ugh

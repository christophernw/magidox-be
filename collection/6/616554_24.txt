I know of no children that are in such a situation - unless their parents have been arrested for a crime and being deported because of that.. . In the Houston area we had on the news recently two children that are illegal that are now within the social services portion of the state government coming here because their parents abandoned them over 8 years ago and are working on the east coast.  They were trying to find and get to these 'parents'  Such parents are the kind that we want to have as citizens?. . I believe the answer to be to quit making people citizens just because they are born here.  Such may have been a good thought when the country was just beginning - but not in modern times with the population problems that we are having now across the country because of such - not to mention the strain that it places upon the middle class since they are the ones that foot the major portion of the tax burden.

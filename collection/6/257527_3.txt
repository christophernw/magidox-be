Muhammad was never worshipped. He was respected and loved as a prophet. Muslims also consider Jesus as a prophet and also dont worship Jesus.. Muslims only worship One God, who cannot take any form or shape.. . How do they compare?.  Accorsing to muslims, both, Muhammad and Jesus were both prophets. JEsus came before Muhammad. Both were given true books, Jesus was given the Bible (Injeel), Muhammad was given Qur'an..   Muslims belive the what Jesus said in the bible as to there will be someone else who comes after him to finish the prophecy..... he was referring to Muhammad.. . Just to correct one statement, Muhammads face was not covered with a veil. . . Hope that answered your question.

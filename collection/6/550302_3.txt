You can't. Ask a blind man what the truth is; his answer cannot contain the parts of the world that are color, perspective, etc. Human have limited senses and limited brain abilities to process that information. Imagine telling a computer to analyze the world, but all it has is a 2mpxl black and white camera and a 5-year-old processor. It's also not simply lack of ability- the MANNER in which our senses and brains are constructed make it impossible to see things as they really are. For example, the world reaches a computer as 1's and 0's. These 1's and 0's are nothing at all like things in themselves. The way the computer processes it will NOT allow it to come to any accurate conclusions. Likewise, the things we see and conclusions we form about them are completely inaccurate, and we are incapable of sensing or understanding things in themselves.. . In short, you can't know anything at all. Anyone who tells you otherwise is just trying to give comfort to inferior humans who will never have any hope of answering the questions they ask. Analyze their explanations and you will find only wishful thinking supported by hope and faith. And if you're willing to let that be your reality- well, don't expect to be able to put it to the philosophical test.. . I think this is actually a very difficult thing for philosophers to accept, because deep down what most philosophers want is to think their way to discovering the Truth. It's hard to keep going when you know firmly that this will never happen.

I guess I would have to say because they want to feel useful, for their esteem and the feeling that they might truly somehow help people in their own way.  . . I'm pretty good at seeing both sides and I really think this lady might think because water is used in therapy situations, water relaxes and feels good, that maybe she can use it in some fashion to help people relax.. . Not only that some people will try anything, they might be the dare devils or the people who are ill and looking for anything to help them.  Plus remember it can be mind over matter, if they think it can help them, maybe they can feel better.

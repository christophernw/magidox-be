Jesus Christ is two things to me: . . 1 - he is my Lord and Savior.  This is a personal religious belief of mine. . 2 - he was a man who lived around 2000 years ago who attepted to bring about a better way of life through loving others and being selfless.  In many ways this Jesus is equally important to the other image of Jesus I have.  I tend to think a lot about history and the morals of historic figures such as Sokrates, Salah al-Din, the prophet Mohammad, King Henry VIII, Julius Caesar and so on.

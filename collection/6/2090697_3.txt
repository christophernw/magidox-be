Yea what those guys said about the testing is true and that's how it started, but they keep them in not only because it's difficult to take out, but gamers have come to expect it in a game. Part of the fun is finding the cheat codes or when you're stuck, using them to get over a difficult section. Even if the developers could remove them with ease, they wouldn't because the fans love cheats.

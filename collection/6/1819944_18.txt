If you walk down the street and men proposition you for sex and grab your buttocks every step of the way, you shouldn't be the least bit bothered, right?  No?. . You think it's perfectly acceptable to proposition people with religion even when they don't want it, so why would you be a hypocrite by being annoyed when someone asks you to spread your legs?. . Non-believers asking to be left alone is not harassment of you.  Get over yourself and your hypochristian behaviour.

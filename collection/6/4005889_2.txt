The military and the city-state became the center of Spartan existence. . The state determined whether children, both male and female, were strong when they were born; weakling infants were left in the hills to die of exposure. Exposing of weak or sickly children was a common practice in the Greek world, but Sparta institutionalized it as a state activity rather than a domestic activity. . At the age of seven, every male Spartan was sent to military and athletic school. These schools taught toughness, discipline, endurance of pain (often severe pain), and survival skills. . At twenty, after thirteen years of training, the Spartan became a soldier. The Spartan soldier spent his life with his fellow soldiers; he lived in barracks and ate all his meals with his fellow soldiers. . Only at the age of thirty, did the Spartan become an "equal," and was allowed to live in his own house with his own familyâ€”although he continued to serve in the military. Military service ended at the age of sixty. . The Spartans viewed themselves as the true inheritors of the Greek tradition. They did not surround themselves with luxuries, expensive foods, or opportunities for leisure. And this, I think, is the key to understanding the Spartans.

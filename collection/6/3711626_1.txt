Bonuses are taxed at the ordinary income rate, but the amount withheld is at a slightly higher rate.  So, it'll be about the same rate as the rest of your paycheck.. . Your employer should include that in the W-2, so it'll raise flags if you don't report it.  You could convince your employer not to do so and pay you under the table, but that brings up a whole different issue.

You can't find out what a company is through the EIN any easier than you can find out who a person is through a SS#.. . Chances are if you got a W2, you worked for them last year (or more likely, they're the parent company of one of your employers last year).  By chance did you fail to get a W2 from someone you worked for?  Perhaps the mystery W2 is from their parent company that uses a different name.

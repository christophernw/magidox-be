well you can always file for a lost title at the dmv if the vehicle is registered in your name.  If not, you can put a mechanics lien on the vehicle, saying that you did repair work and the owner never paid up.  also, if you purchased the vehicle from someone who had no title, then you can use the bill of sale to obtain it.

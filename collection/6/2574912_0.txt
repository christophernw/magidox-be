Your question is almost strange and maybe unclear too.. Aside from the other answers you have already got till now, I can only add something about some risk, in the case you are interested in it.. You know that with the sexual intercourses many illnesses can be transmitted easily.. There are a lot :. HIV, Candidiasis,  Blennorrhea, Syphilis, etc. etc.. Of course, it depends on the partner health.. Hereâ€™s because the use of the condom is always advised for occasional acts with different and unknown people.. Of course, the act itself, as like as the wank, has no effect towards our health.

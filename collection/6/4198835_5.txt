First yes moses had a different job to to. Second moses was already insecure and hesitant to take the task God had given him. One reason was because he had a speach problem (he studdered, Read exudus he had a speach problem).this is why aaron had to speak for moses a lot of the time. Moses wouldn't want to take a job that would make him speak in front of crowds more than he already did. Oh, and by the way  in Moses time Rabbis were also reffered to as Priest until christianity addopted it as its own title. so Rabbi/Preist the same thing.

if you want to loose weight. The only way is burning more calories than you eat. Now if you are overweight and you have a big and collapsed belly it will take a you a long time to reach your goal. Being realistic if you start a diet and start a exercise program by yourself you will quit and than you will eat more than before and will gain more weight.. My advice is  get profesional help and  enroll to weightwatchers.com and they will help you out. Good luck

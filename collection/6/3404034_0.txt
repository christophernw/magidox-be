Policosanol is an extract from the wax of the sugar cane plant (also derived from bees wax). Over a dozen well-designed published studies document the ability of Policosanol to lower LDL cholesterol 15-20 percent and illustrate its safety. The positive effect of improving vessel wall health has been demonstrated with increasing blood flow noted in a recent double-blinded study. Policosanol was shown to be superior than the cholesterol-lowering drugs in improving a beneficial lipid ratio and at increasing blood perfusion to the lower extremity in patients with peripheral vascular disease.. . Another recent study comparing Policosanol to the newest and most powerful cholesterol lowering drug (Arorvastatin) showed Policosanol achieved similar results in improving the cholesterol ratio and was more effective in raising HDL (the good cholesterol). Promotes cardiovascular disease reversal as documented by myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and Doppler ultrasound.

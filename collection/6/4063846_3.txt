Mistletoe. This guy asked me to buy some for a fund raiser.  I told him I had no one to buy it for.  He suggested I buy it for him.  I laughed at the sales pitch. He obviously used it a lot.  But then to my suprise I got some too.  Later we met again under it, and eighteen years and two kids later here we are.

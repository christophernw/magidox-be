It is because it is such an amalgam of other languages.  There are some words that have as many as six or seven meanings: i.e., 'set'.  Set the table.  Badgers live in a set.  A set of golf clubs.  A set in tennis etc.  In particular wherever the British Army went, they returned with words from the local vocabulary which entered the language., i.e. Bungalow, Khaki, etc. However, if you ever tried to learn Gaelic (Irish) you would thank your lucky stars for English.

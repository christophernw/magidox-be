Each one of us was created with a specific destiny to fulfil, and to achieve a distinct greatness. Nothing is without purpose in this universe. Our destinies are pre-ordained AND the only thing that can stop you from attaining your potential and being what you were meant to be is YOU alone.  What We Are Now is the only thing that stops us from being What We Are Meant to Be.. . So step back see what makes you special, and if you need help figuring it out them ask a friend (sometimes absolute strangers can be of help too), once you figure that out, you shall understand that the universe did expend its energies with a specific goal that only you can achieve. We all are dreams of universe that have been crystallised by a moment in time. So it makes you VERY special.. . Too many of us never fulfil our destinies as we never think how we figure in the universe's scheme of things. I'm fulfilling my destiny serving as a bad example [just kidding ;) ]

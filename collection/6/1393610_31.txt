Hoover inherited the Depression, the factors that caused it were in place long before he took office. He got the blame. There was not a lot to do until the worst of it had run its course. Similarly, the Depression was nearly over (comparatively) when FDR took office. Jobs were beginning to be available and his jobs programme eased it a little more but WW2 and the demand for war materiel was the real reason the Depression ended. . . The Depression was a world-wide economic event and contributed to Hitler's rise to power in Germany.

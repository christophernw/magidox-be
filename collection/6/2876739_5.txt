counseling will in some ways help you discover issuses that you each  have that the other may not really know about, and it also opens the communication avenues without the anger and fighting that often happen when at home alone, but both parties must be willing to go ad get the help to make it work, if it is one sided then yes it may not help, or if one of the parties has given up ( too much too late) that can doom the coundeling effort.. . now rose who answered above where the heck do you get your info!!!!. 90% get a grip!!!.  in my personal opinion you are bitter , have possibly gone through that before and instead of offering incouraging advice your totally side swiping the main issue. perhaps you need anger management classes rose. . anyway good luck in your marriage . and always remember it takes 2 to make it work!!

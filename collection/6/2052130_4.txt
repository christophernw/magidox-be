YES THANK YOU... someone that feels the same way!  I feel like its cheating if you buy a turkey from bojangles...  ya know? You shouldnt go out to eat at a restaurant for thanksgiving! You should be with family, cooking, talking, laughing, and YES watching the old football game, much to some women's demise.. I love to cook for thanksgiving.. My house is a complete wreck by the end.... but I love it.. Marie Callenders is open b/c unlike some of us... there are people out there who really are truly bad cooks.. and it may be easier for them to go out and eat there rather than deal with the frustration of cooking and getting razzled up.  So it has to be different to appeal to all americans ya know? . I still totally love thanksgiving at home though.

we are talking about poop right? not worms. iam guessing, anyway, does she have a lot of hair on her rear? trim it, she might have eaten something stringy like grass , or has too much hair in her system from grooming, can cause the poop to be a little stringy and hard, and might hang on more in her rectum. give her some laxatone if thats the case. i have seen my dogs have it hang there before, and its cause they had eaten grass, and when it passed it, hung on. lol

Divine preodrination cannot exist unless you ask for it. This is where free will comes into effect. God wants you for Himself, however He will not force you to your knees. He will not force His Spirit on you without your consent..   You must ask Him for His divine guidance and until you do you are on your own. Once you've made the decision to accept the God of Israel,Abraham and Moses, then your life will be taken to where God wants you to be..   Free will and divine preodrination do not co-exist: one has to be surrendered for the other to exist. .   For Gods' will to exist in your life you have to trust Him completely (read faith) and give up your own free will.

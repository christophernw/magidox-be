Several ways. Contact your employer and send a written request for another copy of your W2, Call 1-800-829-1040 the IRS and request a copy of your tax account for that year. They will send you a copy of any W2 information reported to them. It will look different, but the information is the same, or contact the tax professional who prepared your return and they may have it on file.

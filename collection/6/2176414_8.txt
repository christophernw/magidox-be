It seems to be human nature for people to feel Superior to others..  When I was much in my early 20's I was very thin (size 1 under 75 lbs). People used to come up to me and tell me I was anorexic, that I might think I look good but I actually look like Sh_t.. Mind you these were people who didn't even know me, they would just come right off the street to tell me this.. Right after I had my first child I gained a lot of weight and at one point a group of women followed me around in a Wall-mart store as I was buying under garments simply so they could comment on the size of my rear.. right now I'm slightly overweight but certainly not called Fat by anyone.. I do have an overweight boyfriend and people are constantly asking me why I'm with a Fat guy since I can do better(according to them). I find the situation appalling but that seems to be the case.. People have a need to feel like they are better than others and will say and to anything to make themselves feel superior. Just try to remember that when people act in this manner they are only showing there own insecurity in themselves.. A person who actually has good self esteem does not feel a need to put down others for your own egos.

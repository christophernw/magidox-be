Regular exercise early in the morning and evening if possible will help you more.. Avoid spicy, fatty, starchy and stimulous foods. . You are 100 kg means you have a good hunger and assimilating power. Therefore i will suggest you to shift over to raw diet- sprouts + salads..  Please keep one thing in mind that you  don't need any food for at least 60 days. Then only your fats will burn and you will loose. . Waterfast will worship you..  Best Luck.

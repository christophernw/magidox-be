I take my persian to the vet and have her shaved. She is almost 19 years old and has trouble grooming herself. After she gets shaved she seems so happy. Then I try to keep her brushed until the matts come back then its back for another shave. You could probably do it at home but since mine is so old they put her to sleep to shave her to keep her from going into shock.

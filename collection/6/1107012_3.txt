North by North-west is an older way of saying a certain direction on a compass.. Example: The line that divides North and West is called Northwest, right?. If you were to draw another line between North and your new Northwest line, that would be considered 'the line that is North of Northwest' or 'North by Northwest' or today would just say North-northwest.. The same would work for all the other directions... 'South by Southwest' would be the line between South and Southwest. (South-southwest). If it was the line between the West and the South West, we would call that 'West by Southwest' (West-southwest)

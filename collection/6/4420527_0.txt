why do you want to be thin.. its so un atractive.. i was anorexic and at 16 had no curves at all, i looked like a ten year old and got absolutly no attention from boys. if you want to lose weight it cant be done really quickly... well depending on how big you are now. just eat all fresh food, no white wheat products, lots of water to quicken up your metabolism and do at least half hour exersise a day... you'll be glowing in a couple of weeks!

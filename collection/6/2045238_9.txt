were not in denial...but i think a lot of us..includingthe media have started to push this to the back of our minds and hoped that we could move on to more constructive things...thats the american way...we should never forget this attack on our citizens and country or who it was and what kind of people that did it...however, the best revenge besides killing them all is to show the rest of the world we can recover more successfully than before it happen. . remember those american souls lost on 9/11 and never forget there are cultures that would annihilate us in a second if we give them the chance

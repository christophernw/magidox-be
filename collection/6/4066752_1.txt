Line is the border drawn on your subject.  It can be varied in width to show varying brightness of light or shadow.. . Pos/Neg space is that which is there versus the remainder of the drawing.  For example, in a picture of a spread hand, the positive space is where the fingers and hand mass is, the negative space is the parts in-between the fingers.  It can help in the rendition of the image to look at the negative space rather than the positive.  Sometimes it's a clearer way to see what's going on and not be distracted by something familiar, rather seeing the space as a geometric shape.

If birds are evolved from reptiles, why are there still reptiles?. . Actually, according to Scientific chuva, Man did NOT evolve from apes. They just share a common ancestor. The two groups were separated by millions of years of evolution, that's why men turn out to be men and apes turned to, well, apes.. Hope I've been helpful. (^_^)

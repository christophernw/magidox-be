Despite advances in robotic technology, the general impression is that there will be tasks that will require direct human interaction, although not as many as currently presumed. Mostly the reasoning is that it makes for better PR to have a manned presence in space than simply use unmanned missions. Ultimately, we as a society will need to decide if we wish to colonise space, and we would have to research effective methods for manned travel if we decide in favour.

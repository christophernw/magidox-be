the majority of overseas chinese are from the southern provinces such as Guangdong and Fujian. Hence the western Chinese food tend to be from those areas.. . American chinese has to cater for american tastes too, so you won't find too many 'weird' items on the menu such as dog, really spicy Sichuan food and the really salty stuff from northern china. There are also a lot of vegetables and fungi that would look weird to westerners but be ok to chinese, so they are also not found on american chinese menus.. . Furthermore, the spices that makes chinese food authentic is seldom found in american chinese food cos it's not available (or scarce) so to chinese it doesn't taste like the real thing.

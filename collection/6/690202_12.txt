This is becasue there are many types of cancer and each type of cancer is different. For example a small cell lung cancer cannot be treated by the same chemotherapy as a non-small cell lung cancer. Even for breast cancer, there are different types of cancers with different treatments. Some can be treated using an oestrogen blocker such as tamoxifen. . . However research has advanced and has with the advent of monoclonal antibodies, these can target particular receptors that are overexpressed in cancer, or particular proteins that are overexpressed. These includes herceptin( for breast cancer), Gleevac( for chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal sarcoma) and Geftinib( aEGRF) receptor.

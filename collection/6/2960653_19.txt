actually i see more christian groups that hate Christmas than any liberal groups that do. matter of fact, i can't think of nay liberal groups that do hate christmas, unless you think baptists are liberal.. There are plenty of them crying about the commercialization of Christmas, and fighting against the commercialization of it, by not buy and decorating trees, not wrapping or giving gifts, etc.. but of course, your right-wing lying radio shows don't mention that, do they?

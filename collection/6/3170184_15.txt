just take it back and say you found it but then they may wonder how you knew it belonged to them unless you know them. if thats the case just leave the dog on there front porch and let them find it and stop stealing the bible says thou shall not still.everyone makes mistakes but its its god if you learned a lesson from your mistake.and not do it gain may god bless you

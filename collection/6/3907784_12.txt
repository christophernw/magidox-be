I agree with the third answer; anyone who would classify pre-war Iraq as a stable place to live obviously never lived there.  Of course I have not either, but I have read the auto-biographies of a lot of people (some were even part of Saddam's government) that would strongly disagree that it was "stable".  Do you even know of any other dictator (or any type of ruler for that matter) who has ever been brought up on charges like the ones Hussein has?  Hitler or Trujillo maybe...  The fact is, he needed to be overthrown, but we did not take into account that these people have never had to develop their own government before.  They have always been ruled.  They don't have the mindset to put together their own country; that doesn't make us at fault for the different feuds going on between different groups.  But there definately should have been a better plan for putting the country back together; one that THEY should have come up with.  And anyone who thinks you can CHEAT your way into the WHITE HOUSE is f*cking retarded.  Cheat your way into the presidency?  We've only been doing this 200 years or so...and BUSH was the only one to figure out how to CHEAT...lmfao...

Well, there you go.... another medical practitioner (Dan Arundel) that doesn't know what they're talking about. Very scary indeed! I would avoid that Ipswich Hospital in Suffolk at all costs. Suggesting you can't read a digital meter and have the decimal point in the wrong place.... imagine. Wonder what medical institution he studied at? I thought everyone knew that there are two standards for measuring blood glucose. . . 80 to 110 is considered normal for fasting blood glucose. You can safely go as high as 120 or as low as 70 without raising much concern. The further away from those numbers you go, the more concern you should have. As suggested earlier, there is a fairly wide variance allowed by many doctors. The closer you stay between 85 and 105, the better, in my opinion. I've studied this subject closely. I have gotten two books and read numerous articles on various websites mostly looking for easier and better ways to control type 2 diabetes. I've put together a little website highlighting some of the more important things I've learned here: . http://www.geocities.com/seabulls69/Type_II_Diabetes.html

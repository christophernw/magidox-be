1)typical atmospheric pressure is 1atmosphere or 10^2kilopascals or 760mmHg.. 2)Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude.So external pressure decreases.As preessure decreases volume increases(if the temperature change is insignificant). 3)Water pressure increases with depth (P=h*density*g).So as external pressure increases the volumme decreases.. 4)Here we assume that the temperature doesn't change in the process.Use Boyle's law PV=P'V'. so 760*V=1.30*0.21. which gives V=3.59*10^-4L

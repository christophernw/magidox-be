Your life is  for limited years on this earth.  Think....where  you  came from (while took Birth)...,  and  Where  would you  go to  after death.   Remember , this universe  existed for  somany years.....when you  were  not  there...then also this earth was there....when you would have gone out of this world, then also, the  earth would  remain.     Hence, you  are  a  guest  for few  years on this earth.    Please  be  creative,  enjoy every moments, gain knowledge, help others, educate your children , love your family,  society.....  Ensure,  nothing. wrong happens to this  beautiful universe of God.  Donot support mass destruction...     Your  life  is  precious,  ...imagine...how  blood  runs in your  vain...how  you take  free  oxygen given by god...to make your  life  leaving,  how  you walk  on this  earth...whereas, difficult to walk on Moon  etc...    . . Think, you are  eating/drinking  holding your head high,  whereas  animals  eat /drink bowing their hand down... Also, remember, ....you can eat/drink and swallow ,,,,,only if  the  Gravitational force on earth keep working......   otherwise  difficult to  eat  /drink  at  Moon,,,,,where  there is  no  gravitational force...... . You  are  lucky  to have got  human life...with  creative brains.....use them  for  betterment of the society/ your own family.......etc.....you can  enjoy life.......and appreciate  this  life.....and  creator  of life on the earth.....!!!. . . You  may be from any religion.......but  truth is  that you  are  the  beautiful  creation of  God  which  is  only  ONE...............and prevails  everywhere........and HE  doesnot  discriminate between human beings.......  All humans  being  express happyness  in similar fashion by  . smiling/showing teeth  etc....    It  never happens that  a    Muslim  laughs  from mouth,  and Christian laughs  from stomach  or  Hindu  laughs  from  head.....etc...... . But,  every person on this earth  are different  than others...even  brothers  in same  family from  same parents  are  different  and borne with unique  personality..... This  is  the rule of  God....... . Imagine,,,if all humans are borne  alike......... Imagine.....if  humans  start  eating from  leg..... Imagine....humans ..........start walking  underground...... . . ??????

That poor dog is soooooooo lucky you rescued him! A tick infestation of that severity would have killed him soon. He is most likely anemic, from losing blood, and is a candidate for tick fever.. Please take him to the vet for supplements to build his blood, and antibiotics to ward off tick fever.. He will pay you back with a lifetime of devotion and love.

God created man and woman in a way that they could reproduce together. Homosexuals cannot reproduce together which is why most Christians and the Pope etc don't think homosexuality is right as it is not 'natural'. . I don't know why you care what Christians believe in? If someone wants to believe that the Bible is God's own words but you don't believe that then why must you impose on their beliefs and try to make them think like you? I know you wouldn't like it if a Christian said, hah you should believe in God because I do and I am right and you are wrong and you will go to hell and I shall go to heaven. Not very nice, is it?. . . No, not every single Christian in the World comes and knocks on your door telling you to be a Christian. Only people like Jehovahs etc go knocking on doors, if they do just shut the door on them if you don't want to listen. And if they do it to you and you don't like it then you should know better than to do it to them. Don't fuckin call me the idiot.

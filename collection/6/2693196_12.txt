It may just be your experience that Atheists are geniuses. This is because monotheists and polytheists usually try to answer questions using religous views, while atheists use scientific reasoning because they dont even believe in God!. . However intelligence doesnt depend upon one's faith and religion. Einstein was a Jew and a widely accepted genius. Da Vinci was supposed to be a pagan and he was very intelligent. . . It is still not understood what is the reason for one's natural intelligence. But it is widely supposed to be genetical.

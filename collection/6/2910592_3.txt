Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, is an inflammation of the eye.  It is usually caused by touching the eyes with dirty fingers, but can also be caused by wearing contaminated eye makeup, or even from getting something blown by the wind into your eyes.  I work in a nursing home.  This kind of infection is quite common there, because the elderly are not careful about where they put their fingers and then are not good about washing their hands before touching t heir eyes.  I have treated many following doctor's orders by carefully applying Johnson & Johnson Baby shampoo to the eyelid with a sterile q tip 2 or 3 times a day.  The baby shampoo cleans the eye without irritating the eye lining.  You can also visit with your doctor about getting antibiotic eye drops to apply to your eyes.. Be very careful about rubbing or wiping your eyes with your fingers.  Pink eye is quite contagious. Keep your pillowcase clean by changing it often while your eyes are infected.  Always wipe from the inner corner of your eyes (next to your nose) outward.  Never wipe your eyes inward.  If you use a tissue, wipe with it once then discard it.  Do not reuse it.. If your eyes do not clear up in a day or so, see a doctor.

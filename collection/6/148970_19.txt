Well, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out drinking alcohol impairs your reflexes and mental processes. I have read Section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants before, and one of the reasons we avoid alcohol is because of the "evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days." I am still waiting for the day when a beer company will show a car accident caused by anyone of any age who has been drinking and driving. I had a great-uncle killed by a drunk driver, and my father's 17-year-old brother was run over and killed while in the company of some teenaged boys who were drinking. I also believe there is a dark spirit in most bars. A dependence on alcohol will slow down your spiritual growth and interfere with your ability to make decisions. We are supposed to avoid highly caffeinated drinks as well, and I have also learned the hard way about that. I will eat chocolate but have learned that even too much chocolate is not good for anyone. It's best to have a balanced diet and work on emphasizing fruits and vegetables. Herbal teas are good for when you are sick or doing a cleanse. I try to look for herbal teas without added caffeine, but if I am really, really dragging I might have some with caffeine. My weakness is probably sugar and chocolate, so I just try to keep that to a minimum.

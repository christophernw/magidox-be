I agree with the previous answer that there are radical Christians who are so excited or pushy about their faith, that they actual can scare people off.  And then there are actual kind loving people who just want to share their joy in Christ with you and help.  Yes, what you said was rude.  Ask yourself what you believe in and based on what.  Are you 100% confident without a doubt?  If your answer is no, than maybe you should welcome someone who actually wants to share what they know with you.  They may have been nrought to you for a reason.

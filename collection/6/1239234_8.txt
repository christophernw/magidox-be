Possibly because there still is racial tension in America.. It was quite evident during the Hurricane Katrina disaster.. MLK fought against physical segregation, which is now illegal, however psychological segregation is still going strong in some parts.  It's not all white americans, however it's still enough to notice that racial tension still exists on a personal, community and institutional level.

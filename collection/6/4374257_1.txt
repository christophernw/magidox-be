first things first NO YOU CANNOT DIE FROM NOT GETTING YOUR PERIOD.  your life is not in danger.  i can't even think of the reasoning behind that statement.  the only periodish thing that can kill you would be too much bleeding.  . . first i have a few questions.  when was your last pregnancy test?  if it was recent, you're probably not pregnant.  if it was a while ago, there is the off chance that you tested negative on all of them.  if it hasn't been for at least two months, go ahead and get another one and test one last time.  . . how much do you weigh?  if you're underweight, your body knows to conserve.   serious female athletes and women in the holocaust don't/didn't get their periods.. . stress stress stress.  i thought i was pregnant for a little bit, and that helped me to delay my period, adding even more stress.  are you stressed?. . i want to say poly cystic ovary disease can cause a lag in periods, but i might be wrong about that.  one surefire sign of pcod is abdominal pain and cramping.  . . also, how old are you?  how long have you been getting your period.  if your out of your teens, it's not as normal to be irregular anymore.  if you're still in your teens, it's pretty much expected that you be irregular.. . could be a hormonal imbalance.  . . there are other things, but i can't think of them, and they probably grow increasingly rare.. . i say, take the blessing of not having your period.  i can sense mine coming on (i'm totally irregular, so i just have to divine when it's coming) and i'm not exactly excited about it.

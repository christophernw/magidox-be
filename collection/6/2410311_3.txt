I'm sure it has when Jesus was walking the earth as well as his disciples. but it takes great faith not only on your part but even more so on the faith healers part. much fasting and prayer.. even Paul couldn't heal himself of the "thorn" in his side. so don't despair and be glad for what you have. a God who loves you as you are. Amen

bdenton2k gives a very good answer.the only thing i would add(more for your own comfort than anything)is to have notes handy with general high points that you want to be sure you cover.by far most important is your knowledge of the subject,passion for the subject,and confidence that you have something that other people want or need to know.have fun and as stated before,it will come to you.

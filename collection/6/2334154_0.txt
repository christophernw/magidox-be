Gotta luv the spots!  I have 2 appaloosas and they are the best.  My one is too smart for his own good.  But they arent the perfect horse for everyone, they can be smarter than their human and that is usually why people dislike them.  Yes they are stubborn but so am I!  I wont do something unless you tell me WHY I should do it and that is how appies think!

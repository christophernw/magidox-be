Your cat could have a kidney problem if it is drinking a lot of water. This is abnormal as cats are evolved from a desert type of cat and normally don't need a lot of water to survive. This happened to my poor old cat (Boo Boo) and he died as I could not afford to pay for the vet bills. Please take your cat to the vet to see if that is what the problem is (The poor little thing).

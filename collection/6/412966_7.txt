Because the National Guard is out of pocket right now seeing as how they are stationed in Iraq.  However, I agree that we should be checking for papers and loading up the ILLEGALS.  CITIZENS have the right to protest peacefully but ILLEGALS (if they do have the right, which I doubt) shouldn't.  It would keep a lot of them at home if they thought they were facing deportment.  Then again, it could start a very violent situation which is most likely why the government isn't doing anything like what you're suggesting.  Although I would personally love to see it happen.  Oh and just to clarify things:  NO coming here ILLEGALLY is NOT YET a felony.  Under proposed bill HR 4377 (or whatever the numerical designation is) it would become a felony.  Rigt now it's only a misdemeanor.

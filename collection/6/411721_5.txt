I believe your interpretation of the phrase is in error. Charles Whitman shot, killed and wounded many people from the watchtower at the University of Texas before he was shot and killed by the authorities. He used a variety of high powered hunting rifles and fired hundreds of rounds. He held a decided advantage by holding the high ground which could very nearly not be assaulted. What the term means is to take verbal shots at someone or thing from a position of strength.

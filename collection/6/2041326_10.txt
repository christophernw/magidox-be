For enjoyment "Cats Cradle" By Kurt Vonnegut. For fun "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" By Roald Dahl. For adventure "Gullivers Travels" By Jonathan Swift. For human behavior "Lord of the Flies" By William Golding. For finding self "Walden" By Henry David Thoreau. For group discussion "The Giver" Lois Lowry. For introduction to great Lit. "Animal Farm" By G. Orwell. For importance to Lit. "The Illiad and The Odyssey" By Homer. Two Books I also Recommend are "Clockwork Orange" And "Still Life With Woodpecker". In My Opinion "The Bible" and "Aesops Fables" are the two most important classic texts ever written.

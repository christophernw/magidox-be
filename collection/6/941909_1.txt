We had a business that sold different emergency items to hospitals, clinics and ambulances. We had to get the rights to "rep" the product in the area. When people would call us for supplies, we would call the company that made them and they would "drop ship" / send them directly to customer without us having to do anything but bill them for the product. We took our percentage of the sale and sent the supplying company their portion....it's called being the "middleman" and can be very lucrative.

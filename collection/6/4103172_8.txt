I think there is about 15% of students who are hands-on learners.  Their learning styles are different and they don't fit in with what works for the majority.  Most teachers don't have time to figure out how to engage those hands-on learners, so those students sit there and feel stupid, but they are not stupid, they just haven't been exposed to a style that allows them to absorb the information.  . . I think it's a shame that these students leave school feeling like failures.  They are our artists, culinary stars, auto mechanics, etc.  They have a lot to offer and they'd probably do much better in college but since they had such a bitter experience their first 12 years of school I doubt many of them go on to try college.

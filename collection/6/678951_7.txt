First, alcohol isn't prohibited in the Bible - getting drunk is.  Responsible use of alcohol is not a sin.. . Smoking is not even mentioned in the Bible.  But it can be inferred to be a sin, because it can easily be an addiction, and it destroys the body.. . As you are a Christian, I would think you would know these things. . . Whether or not something is in the Pledge of Allegiance matters not, since the Pledge is not a legally binding document - nor, for that matter, is the Declaration.  The Constitution, however, IS a legally binding document. . . Love Jack. . PS: I have to respectfully disagree with nopedamni.  Prohibition may have been a failure in the sense that it didn't stop everyone from drinking, and it helped to spawn organized crime.  However, Prohibition did cause a noticeable change in Americans' drinking habits.  Before Prohibition, the average American consumed almost three times as much alcohol per year as after Prohibition, a stat which still stands today.. . PPS:  Also, there are nude beaches in the USA if anyone wants to go topless tanning, or all nude tanning, so there's no need to go to Mexico or Brazil.  I am fortunate enough to live near one in NJ.  Also, in NYC it's legal for women to go topless in the parks.

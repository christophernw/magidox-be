I was wondering about that myself!  On Y!A, it seems that atheists almost exclusively bait Christians, but no other group.  One even praised Buddhists for being enlightened.. . And why does it bother them if someone believes in a hereafter?  Many many cultures that had little or no contact all had some  insight about Spirit and what becomes of it once it leaves the body.  This belief in no way hurts them, yet most seem to be aggravated by it.. . I can sympathize, because some Christians can be dogmatic and hypocritical, but others really accomplish alot of good things.  But the same can be said about atheists themselves!. . Why can't we all just play nice?. . Peace to you all!

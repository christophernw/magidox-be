If you are on prescription acid reflux aids, it might not be wise to change this without consulting with a doctor. Acid in your esphogus can cause lasting damage!. .  However, here are some things that helped me.. 1. Sleep with you head elevated. Put wood blocks under your bed to tilt the angle ever so slightly so your digestive tract is aided by gravity.  If you don't want to put blocks under your bed, get another pillow to elevate your upper body.. . 2. limit your intake of acidic, spicy and caffeinated foods.  every day foods like tomatoes, peppers, soda pops and coffee can increase the amount of acid your body produces. . . 3. drink more water. keeping well hydrated can often help neutralize your body chemistry.. . These are the best things I can think of to tell you.

You see, fish in the ocean have a LOT of water. This means that when they crap, their ammonia is diluted by a gigazillion tons of water. In a fishtank, you have say, 50 gallons of water and sooner than later, the tank gets contaminated. . . This is one of the reasons why you need a filter. The filter produces bacteria that breaks down the ammonia into two lesser evil by products and keeps the fish alive. (nitrate and nitrite)  . . Filter also adds oxygen by recirculating the water. But this causes the temperature of the fishtank to go down, which is why they need a heater.

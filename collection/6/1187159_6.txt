the way I was raised is that in the end time is when we will meet the Lord and be with him in Heaven.  Dont know anyother way of putting it.. I have a friend that we talked some on this and I asked her if she was afraid of death.. she told me NO it is just time for her to be in Heaven.  Your going to get all kinds of answers on this.  But the ones that know that there is a God will tell you about the same as I did.. I guess.

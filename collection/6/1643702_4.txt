I don't know where you are geographically, but most states and provinces have a labour board-its free for Canadians to call in and ask these types of questions that are not covered on the boards' website or information packets. I'm not sure about the U.S. or other countries although I'm sure most places have similar organizations.  The best place to check to find these numbers is to call or visit your local employment/unemployment agency or career counselling areas- (just look under the yellow pages for the aforementioned titles) they might be able to help you and if not definetely be able to point you in the right direction. As far as your co-worker goes, you should probably just ask him what his wounds are from. If he is open about dressing them in public he should be open about talking about it.  I would casually and nicely make a joke about him doing that in the open (with no one else around) and if he still does it then let him know how it bothers you. Then if he still does it-definetely look into it more and find out what actions you need to take. It is possible that he is unaware as to how it may gross people out.  Good Luck.

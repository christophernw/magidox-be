No contest...Christmas. there's several reasons. it's so jovial a time. nothing can break its impermeable shell. it's so happy, so hopeful, so...awesome. plus, the presents, the food, the candy, the presents, the food, the cards, the gifts, the spirit in the air...it's an amazing time of year. what about you?

They do. At-least many of the Baptist churches I have attended will shame people who commit a sin that the congregation doesn't like. Preachers will make an example out of them, and members will leave. NOONE is above others, but they seem to think they are, and if a sin is found out, many members will turn against that one person, as if they are better, when we all KNOW they are as guilty of other sins, just better at hiding. . . THATS the main reason I no longer attend church. Can't stand the hypocrites.

i think that people are afraid of the truth. . like Flight 93 that crashed in Pe.nnsylvania on 9/11.  That thing. was shot down, but it sure makes a better story to say that. "Americans stood up and fought!". . They may have fought, but that thing was shot down...I saw the. planes.. . So keep on posting & try not to get frustrated.  Some people. hear you

Well like everyone black, White, purple or gray.  It depends on the person and his or her plight in the world.  My life is pretty good.  I grew up with my mom and dad until high school then they got divorce, then I worked for AT&T and I got married had children and I have a great house with a pool and drive a great cars.  Now not every black person or white, pink or purple person can say that. so I think your question needs to be narrowed down. to specify what class of people you are talking about.   Now if you want to get down to it the general black person always has to fight with their position in life but it's up to each individual as to how much they want to fight or flight those who hold thier ground with politeness and ambition they will see and get more then those who don't.. (oh by the way I am black)

some people are just curious I guess. Usually when you see a new person you start thinking and asking yourself questions. People constantly ask if my son is a boy or girl because I let his hair grow long. sry not the same I know but still. Maybe you look like someone they haven't seen before or you have a certain accent. Its natural for people to be curious.

The best thing to do would be to open an account with a brokerage house and roll your 401k over to a Rollover IRA account.  From that account you will have a wide variety of stocks and mutual funds to choose to invest in.  A good index fund like the ones that track the major indices like the S&P 500 or the Russell 2000 are good bets for long term growth.  I'm painting broad brush strokes here, so if you would like additional details or have other questions feel free to drop me a line.  Good luck to you!

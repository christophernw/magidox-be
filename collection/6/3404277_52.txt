because the first Jewish people were nomadic, so the animals they kept had to be able to graze, be herded, and travel.  piggers don't graze, herd or like to travel long distances by foot, so they were an inefficient food source.  add to the fact pigs liked to wallow in mud and carried germs, so they were considered unclean.

Don't forget the duke of wellington, who coincidently defeated Napoleon at the battle of Waterloo...well, along with the help of the Prussians and General Blucher (that fact is famously disputed, but let's leave that for another day). Wellington did much to improve the lives of the soldiers of the British Army in his day, making sure that they had enough rations and supplies rather than Napoleon who gradually lost track with the lives of his Grande Armee (apparently the deaths of hundreds of Frenchmen in the Russian Winter was quite lost to him in his path for glory). Wellington once even went to great lengths to get supplies for his men when his officers simply refused to bow and risk their dignity to Spanish merchants in return for supplies; his officers then came back empty-handed and Wellington went himself, returning with carts-full of supplies. His officers, as recounted, were astonished: "How did you do it, sir?" - to which the Duke modestly replied: "Oh, I just bobbed down." . Moreover, the affectionate nickname given by his soldiers: "Old Nosey" clearly shows the extent of his involvement in the improvement of the soldier's daily life while others have said: "We would prefer to see his long nose in a fight than two thousand reinforcements anyday." Now, there's a great general - he didn't conquer countries...but he did a damn good job as a general.

find out what kind of insurance your mom has. if she has full coverage. it looks like you are not on the insurance policy as an insured driver (since you dont have a license)... the only thing you can do is... say your mom was driving it and got into that accident.. someone cut her off and did a hit and run....which it sounds like to me happened... this will only work if your mom has full coverage.. if she only has liability... sorry... you are out of luck... things happen.. breathe....

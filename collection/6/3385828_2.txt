get youself on wikipedia mate:. . "SEDOL stands for Stock Exchange Daily Official List, a list of security identifiers used in England and Ireland for clearing purposes. The numbers are assigned by the London Stock Exchange, on request by the security issuer. SEDOLs serve as the NSIN for all securities issued in the United Kingdom and are therefore part of the security's ISIN as well.. . Although SEDOL was to have been superseded by ISIN, problems with the ISIN system have since forced a reversal of this decision. In particular, a single ISIN is used to identify the shares of a company no matter what exchange it is being traded on, making it impossible to specify a trade on a particular exchange or currency. For instance, Chrysler trades on twenty-two different exchanges worldwide, and is priced in five different currencies. An expanded ISIN standard is currently being formulated to address this problem."

You can be whoever you want to be. You are probably shy because you are afraid to confront certain situations and you find comfort in adopting a passive stance. If you want to change your personality I suggest you read some books about it. I recommend "Personality Plus" by Florence Littauer. It can really help you understand your own personality and give you a head start if you want to change the way you react in social interactions.

Rabies (from a Latin word meaning rage) is a viral disease that causes acute encephalitis in animals and people. It can affect most species of warm-blooded animals, but is rare among herbivores. In unvaccinated humans, rabies is almost invariably fatal once full-blown symptoms have developed, but prompt post-exposure vaccination usually prevents symptoms from developing.

Devil Dog summed it up:. . "i see them as people who dont know what they want. . p.s if anyone thats a bi is reading this MAKE UP UR DAMN MINDS!!!!!!!!!!!!". . They doubt their reality, doubt their committment, and believe them to be either fearful of their homosexuality or "greedy". Really, it's ridiculous. The haters are resentful of bisexuals because they can be "straight" more easily. It's that simple. It's not right for bisexuals to lie, and it's not right for gay people to assume bisexuals are lying. But people are generally ignorant and judgemental. So they will.

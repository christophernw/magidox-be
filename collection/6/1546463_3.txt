because space is as far as we know infiniant. there is no end to it and theregfore it has no rotation around any set point like earth does. earth has day ad night because of the spinning on its axis. space is both closer and further from the sun as we know it. if you try to imagine space as a whole you will blow your mind because infinity is impossible to comprehend.. . a better question is a conversation me and a friend has about anti-matter and the existance of a paralell existance and what and where and how it would be effected by our daily lives or how it effects our daily lives.

Standard steel wheels are usually comprised of two pieces of stamped steel that are welded together.  The rim section is usually rolled on a special machine and the butt ends are welded together.  The center section is a simple stamping that is then welded to the rim.  The hub opening and bolt holes are either punched out in the stamping process or are drilled out after the stamping.. . Cast wheels (usually aluminum) are usually made with a low pressure die casting process.  Molten aluminum is injected into a four-piece (top, bottom and two side pieces) die and is allowed to cool.  The wheels are then inspected, machined and finished.. . There are other methods as well.  Here's a link with some good information:  http://www.tirerack.com/wheels/tech/techpage.jsp?techid=90

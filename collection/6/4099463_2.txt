I sound like a broken record answering these questions, but I am just so impressed with my new exercise program.  Look I know you don't want a DVD, but this DVD is worth buying.  I challenge you to check out the website and do the freebie exercises on line.  You don't need any equipment to do these exercises.   It is called t-tapp because the lady's name is Terry Tapp.  She used to put models into shape.  Her techniques work and they work fast.  I got involved because my doctor recommended it to me.  In seven days of doing the DVD  I lost an inch off my hips and waist. Plus I lost two inches off my abdominal area which is the hardest place for me to loose weight.  I have been doing t-tapp for three weeks now and I LOVE my new body.  It total looks different now.  Good luck with getting fit, but I am telling you this is the way to go.

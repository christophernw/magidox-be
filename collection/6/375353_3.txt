Well, my mother-in-law thinks that the Catholic religion is the only one and the rest of them aren't any good. She even said that if your not Catholic you will go to hell.What makes her think that it is perfect? I am Catholic and I am open minded about religion, our daughter got married in a Lutheran church and is one now. I am not offended but my husband was; he's like his mother.,so are his sisters too.

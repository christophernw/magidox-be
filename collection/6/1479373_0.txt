It was a blessing. I really enjoy being in the house of God, knowing that there are others around me who know the love of Jesus Christ and the sacrifice He made for us. It is nice to get away from the wordly things, even if only for 2 hours and to focus on God and His wonderful love for us. I am in a new church in a new country and I already feel like I am at home.

You may need a prescribed ointment of some sort, but one thing that really helps (and you can get it over-the-counter) is an eye wash.  I think the brand I've used is Cholirium (I'm sure that's spelled incorrectly).  It has a little cup on top and you squeeze the eyewash into it then put the cup down onto your eye and blink into the solution...it really helps cleanse the eye and make it feel better.

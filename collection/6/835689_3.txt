Some viruses can introduce their DNA into the host organism's genome.  This can disrupt and/or add genes to the host.  When a virus excises its DNA from the host's genome, it can also carry some of the host's DNA with it.  Subsequent infections into other cells will result in the stowaway DNA being carried  along.

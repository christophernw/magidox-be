Assuming you do mean court cases, there is no shortage of the government wrongfully prosecuting chemists for purchasing so called "restricted chemicals" for perfectly legitimate uses.. Just because of a few bad eggs and a bunch of stupid government officials, the rest of us must suffer, both in our access to useful chemicals and by the loss of potential scientific gains which would have resulted.  I dont know who decided that owning an Erlenmeyer flask should be illegal without a permit (in my state), but I will tell you one thing, those people who would use it for drugs will most definatly find a substitute, whereas legitimate chemists might have no other option.. This topic really touches a nerve with me.

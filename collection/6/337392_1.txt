First, it is illegal for a creditor to call and threaten legal action unless they plan on following through.  Secondly, if they call you, request to speak with a supervisor.  Third, visit the FTC website for consumer protection, and find out what all of your rights are.  And take action against the collection agency if your rights have been violated.  The FTC website contains alot of indept information that could save you alot of time, stress and money.. . Also, if they do try and take you to court,and you have proof of your efforts to pay on this bill, chances are the court will laugh them out of court and side with you.  The court will probably see that you are making the effort to pay on the bill and ask the collection agency why they are suing??!! It isn't like they aren't accepting your payments, so just keep sending the $50 a month, and more if you can afford it

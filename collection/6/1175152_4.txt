well basically crude oil is the pure oil obtained from the ground. it contains different hydro carbons which are seperated through fractional distillation as they have different masses. for example when the crude oil, being the mixture of all these hydro carbons and all sticky, is heated to a certain level then these heavier hydro c's evaporate to a certain level and are caught forming petrol.  . obviously this distillation starts at something like 20 degrees celcius continouly rising. crude oil cant really be used in its pure form for anything.

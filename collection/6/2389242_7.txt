Because when you get seriously injured from NOT wearing protective gear when you might have walked away with minor injuries, then it becomes everyone else's problem.  . . The idea of insurance or governmental programs is that it spreads cost over a large group of people.  How much do you suppose it might cost to maintain you in a partially paralyzed state for life?  I say it would be fine for you to do what you want if you posted a two million dollar bond in escrow somewhere.  If a bad thing happens, then its on your tab.  It is in the public interest that you NOT unnecessarily seriously injure yourself...therefore we have laws.

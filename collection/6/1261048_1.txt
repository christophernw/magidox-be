When I was growing up, we had a TV, but we were only allowed to watch it for an hour during the day and then after dinner, we'd watch tv as a family. So what did we do with all of that spare time?  We went outside and played games until dusk.  Soccer, tennis, basketball, etc.  . . A child may complain of boredom with no TV and no computer, but they will eventually find something productive to do with their time.  Also, he/she will appreciate the time that he.she gets to spend watching TV or using the computer more.

Look at your local newspaper rental ads for places in your area.  Rent is determined by what you offer, ie, air, water, shower, washer, etc.  Also by space rented ie backyard, front porch, square footage.  Anywho, the ads will give you an idea of what the going rates are in your area.  Also you can speak with real estate agents.  Don't forget to get applications and no matter what do background checks....don't want to wind up on People's Court :).  GLuck

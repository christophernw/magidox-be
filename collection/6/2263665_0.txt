How do I get my profile out of a website? . I had allowed my professional details tobe put up on a company websitewhen I was a part of the business.Now I am out of the company but my profile and details contines on the website.My partner promised to remove my profile from the website but contines to use it as it is advantageous to him and benefits his business. How can I get the website altered by myself without his help? Can I get compensated as long as my name and details are used by him without my consent?Looking for suggestions.

Their ILLEGAL parents should NOT have broken our laws. Their kids,should NOT even be considered an American, just by being BORN here! If the PARENTS are illegal,then their kids should be ILLEGAL! They should NOT have SNEAKED into our country,in the FIRST PLACE!!!!!!.  If the kid was born in a GARAGE,would that make him a CAR???!!! NO,so why should being born on our soil automatically make the kid a citizen? This CRAZY law needs to be done away with!! DEPORT THEM ALL!!! NO AMNESTY,NO SURRENDER!!!!!!!!!!

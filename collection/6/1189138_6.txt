She is famous because she knows all the hot spots to be seen. She doesn't hide from the paparazi, but gives them exactly what they want...great pic.s that earn them lots of money and gives Paris the exposure she wants. She also knows how to market her name as a brand. Lastly I think she has kept the publics attention because she is always getting in trouble and doing crazy things. I think if more people were honest they would admit to secretly wanting the heiress life of Paris Hilton. That's why we watch her and all the other 'it' girl's in Hollywood.

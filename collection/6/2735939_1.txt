Dandruff can be from a number of things.. . If your scalp is itchy as well then the chances are you are over washing it.  Try missing the odd days or two, or using a 'frequent' shampoo.. . If your scalp is not itchy then try one of the branded anti dandruff shampoos.. . When I had a dry itchy scalp (with some dandruff) I used Voseen.

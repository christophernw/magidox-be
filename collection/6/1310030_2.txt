The Capacitor blocks the DC current for a short time because it needs time to be charged by. So, the initial condition of the capacitor is Q(0)=0. where Q is the charge but after some time (ms) the the voltage drop Eq(t) will arise to get its maximum value.because electrons needs time to escape from one plate (+) to another plate (-). The integral amount of current is Q(t) which is a time function.

Think of it this way, who would of known that a platypus, a mammal, can lay eggs? A baby's smile is soo angelic.. when a baby smiles, u just feel soo happy.. and the trees start as a small seed but grow to be soo tall, like the mustard seed, the smallest seed for a tree, but grows up to be one of the tallest trees!! The sky and the earth are made so perfectly, in a uniformed set of ways..with emotions.. I dunno about you.. but too me, those are just the very little things that are the proofs of God!

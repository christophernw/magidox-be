Where did you adopt her? She might have a reason to be afraid of bowls. Her privious owner...could have done anything. I know it sounds a little weird, but when shes watching, drink a little out of the bowl yourself. When she barks at the sink, put the water dish in it and fill the sink with water. do the same with the shower; keep the dish where you can reach it when you get out. Just put it there (with water in it, of course).

I have to tell you a sad story. Yes, I am only 13 but I still realize the mistakes of the world and problems but anyway.. Two years ago around June 27 late at night there was a thunderstorm. My dog, Sam, hated thunder and he would always hide. One day I left a screen door open since it was letting fresh air in. Sam ran out in the storm while I was with my parents at someones house. The next day we found out he was hit was car. It was difficult to move on but by August 4 we got a new dog. Why? My family missed a dog greeting you at the door. We missed the little joy that can make our troubles go away. So we looked and looked and now we have a wonderful black lab mix named Musca. We've had her for 2 years now and we can't be much happier. Look for another dog and hope that your golden retriever is safe and alive, wherever he is.

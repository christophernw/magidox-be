The broader the skills the more likely they will have transferability.  Every job has value.  Do a good job, learn as much as you can, take on other assignments that might not be in direct line of your job but offer other opportunities to develop. Finally, speak to your supervisor regarding your individual development....don't go empty handed have a few ideas about what you might like to do..good luck

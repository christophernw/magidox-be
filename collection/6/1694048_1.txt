List all the things that straight men say drives them nuts about women, then delete them!!!  I'm just glad to have a partner that I don't have to buy a diamond bracelet for every time I want to do something freaky.  Poor straight guys.  No wonder so many of them run to me for action.  Oh, and that proves man on man action is better too.  You don't see gay guys jumping the fence in droves to score with girls.  . . Damn are we lucky.

Most successful sales people will tell you that sales is about building relationships. But as the nature of your job is about selling to people that may not trust you right off, you'll require a lot of perseverence.. . But aside from any gimmics, I'd say listen to your customer, look them in the eye, ask and remember their names spouse and kids included. Ask them about their interests and get them to talk about themselves. The more they open up and see you as a person, the better your chances will be. And if you can address their problems (financing, credit, payments, trade-ins, etc.) you'll probably get a sale.. . Know that statistically somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 out of 4 customers will walk before deciding what they want to do. Be sure you do the best you can to get their info, follow up and create repeat business.. . Finally, don't treat a customer like a mark, treat 'em like a person.If they enjoy the experience, they may refer friend and family, give out business cards, have toys for their kids!

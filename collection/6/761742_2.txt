Well you got the mentality down.. . Do you understand that women studies--is usually about women who want to leave man's oppression and be treated equally? To be honored for their acheivement. I think you maybe need to ask this question over in relationships.. .

Learn the words to Josh Kelley songs--because for a young dude he kind of gets us--and above all else--stay away from my daughter.

The same way Thurmond supported segregation and switched to the Republican party so that he would gain support for his hatred. . . Byrd admits he made a mistake in his youth.  Get over it.  Ever make a mistake?  Of course not.  I forgot, you're perfect.  In your own little dream world where all this crap you tout actually exists and is true. I pity you and especially that little girl.. . P.S.  The "democrats" don't care what you believe.  . . P.S.S.  Why can't republicans come up with recent things to whine about instead of things that happed 10-50 years ago?

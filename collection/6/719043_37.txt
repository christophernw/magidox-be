I am a Roman Catholic.  It is the largest religion in the world not because it is the most popular, it is hated by many people.  It is the largest because divine providence has made it that way.. . My father is Italian and my mother Irish which is one reason I was blessed to know the Catholic Church.  Consider the following:. . Jesus Christ only lived 33 years, never went more than 30 miles from his home, never wrote a book, never was on tv, never made a cd or any multimedia source and YET. . -- Jesus Christ has influenced the world more than any person;. . -- Jesus Christ's existence separates history (ad or bc);. . -- Jesus Christ has more books written about him than any person in history;. . -- Jesus Christ is the Ruler of the largest religion in the world;. . -- Jesus Christ had 11 apostles and numerous martyrs die excruciating deaths believing in the Messiah, the Son of God;. . -- Jesus Christ as the promised messiah fulfilled over 300 prophesies in the Old Testament. Just fulfilling 50 makes the odds of doing so 10X135 power, an astronomical number. No human being or religious leader's existence was fortold with such clarity, never fulfilled so many prophesies about them, not even Moses, Muhammad (pbuh), Buddha, Confuscious or anyone! . . In short, Jesus Christ has accomplished things NO OTHER HUMAN BEING HAS DONE in the entire history of mankind. If anyone thinks Jesus Christ is JUST A GOOD TEACHER they are very unrealistic by making such a huge understatement.

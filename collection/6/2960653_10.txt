I didn't realize Liberals hate Christmas. I'm liberal, as are most of my friends, and none of us hate it. I do admit I am a little sick of all of the commercialization of it though. . As far as why we expect Christians (a lot of Liberals happen to be Christian too you know)to be tolerant of others that have different beliefs than you, why shouldn't we? I always thought that the Christian faith taught you to love thy neighbor. Wouldn't that mean to be tolerant of their views also? I'm not saying that you have to believe the same thing, but just be accepting. If anything right wing Christians are the ones expecting everyone to believe the same way they do and try to force those beliefs down our throats. . One of the great things about the United States is that we have freedom of religion, but the Christian extremists are trying to do away with that. What ever happened to separation of church and state?

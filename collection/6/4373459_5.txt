Unfortunately, you have a HUGE problem!  The only thing I have found that works is Coyote Urine.  You can purchase it at a feed and seed store in the country.  Course if you neighbor is using bone meal in their soil to help their plants grow.. and depending on how smart your cat is, he/she will figure out that the nasty old coyote is not around during the day (coyotes hunt at night or early morning) and just go there during the day.  If none of this works, I would speak to the neighbor, offer to "scoop" their garden on a regular basis and perhaps bake them some cookies!  Good Luck.  Once a cat has found a favorite spot to "go" they don't like to change unless there is a very strong overpowering reason to.  . . Oh, just thought of another, perhaps not as easy, but maybe just as affective.  We had a cat that liked to "go" behind the entertainment center that was situated in a corner.  It was MURDER to try to get back there to clean her mess up.  I did not want my house smelling like cat or coyote, so I filled a spray bottle with water and everytime she went to the entertainment center, she would get sprayed.  It took about a week but she finally decided she would rather use her box.  You would have to spend the entire time outside with her to catch her but it might be worth it.. . Good Luck!!!

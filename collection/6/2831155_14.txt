Death is a experience of life that is gut wrenching, but we're happy it happened at the same time.....it's when the spirit leaves the body of a human, it's when that person can no longer hear you, no longer see you, no longer feel you the same way you can him because he's dead and you are alive....somehow think of yourself without response, without feeling, with nothing...an out of body experience, except you're never coming back. I work on a cancer floor, and someone dies just about every week, i've seen the bodies of a few, and i learned to cope because i understood that to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. that brings me comfort and it helps me to have and understanding of death....i see people dying everyday, and it's a slow process and sometimes fast..but it's going to happen, and many have seen angels, lights, different things....some sing before they die, and they are real happy, many say that they are going to die and do within that same hour or 24 hours....every one's experience is different....seeing people dying everyday gives you a different perspective on life...it makes you want to straighten up, it makes you want to fix things...i just wanted to answer your question because i see this thing called death everyday, i don't like it, but then again when it comes i appreciate it because my sweet person is no longer calling out to God because the pain is unbearable, alot of my people have settled in their own hearts and are ready to die, it's up to us to accept it as well.....i hope i helped with your question and spreaded some light on this issue......maybe encouraged you and enlightened you.

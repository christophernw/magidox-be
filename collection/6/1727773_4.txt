I think it depends if you're the one thinking of it, or if it's someone you know. A long time ago I tried it a few times. But through counseling and encouragement from certain people over the years, I realized that suicide will not fix your problem. It only ends your life and messes up the lives of the people who care about you. Even if you might think that nobody does right now, there are people who do. Suicide, if anything, is the most selfish thing a person can do! One person's suicide affects many others lives. Don't do it, and you'll see it WILL make you a stronger person!

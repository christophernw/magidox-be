Let me tell you some points:. 1. Sunni or Shia, both groups of Muslims hate terrorism & people like Laden. Terrorism has no place in Islam.. 2. Sunni Muslims do not consider terrorists as heroes.. 3. Yes, there may be some problems among Sunni & Shia Muslims in Iraq but those are just for political reasons. Every country has political parties who mostly have disagreement among them. And, sometimes it goes extreme.. . Islam has no place for racism & bigotry. That's why we can't conclude that one of them are better than the other.

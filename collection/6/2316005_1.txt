After 6 months of not being in school you must begin paying, or put them on deferrment.  If it has been 6 months and your loans are also not on deferrment and you have been receiving bills for the loans..chances are you can kiss your return goodbye.  Thanks for reminding me..my loan's deferrment is up next month..I should probably call.

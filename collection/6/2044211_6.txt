Mate if your  in the Phillipines I got to assume your not looking at the larger bikes.You know your traffic conditions better than I do take a good look at whats on the road most of the smaller japanese bikes are reliable because of years of refinement.I assume your after reliable economical transport first and foremost.Look at the single cylinder models available and buy the one in the best condition you can afford a four stroke is the better option in the long run but if the two strokes are in better condition go with that.A twin cylinder would be a little smoother but once again it depends on which of the bikes available is in the best condition.If its the first motorcycle you have owned take a friend or someone who knows something about motorcycles.. Good Luck.Hope this helps.

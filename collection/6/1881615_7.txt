I highly doubt that it's "gone bad". Follow the above suggestions for softening it (except the ones that involve the microwave).. . Do not follow the suggestions of storing it in plastic. Plastic should only be used for short-term food storage (e.g. leftovers in fridge, lunches), and even then you should use caution with plastic for food storage.. . Store it in a glass container. Make it as airtight as possible. If you keep a piece of fresh bread or an apple slice in it (that will help keep it moist), be sure to change the bread or apple slice regularly (as both of those spoil fairly quickly).. . I've encountered an alternative to the apple or bread slice, that works very well. Usually in grocery stores in the baking aisle, although you might come across them in specialty cooking gadget stores.. . I believe it's a piece of clay, and there are simple instructions on the packaging. I think you just soak it in water for a bit. Then you keep it in your jar of brown sugar, much like the bread or apple (only no problems with spoilage). Soak it again every month or so (it says on the package) to keep it moist.

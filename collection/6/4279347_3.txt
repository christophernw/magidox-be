Obedience classes are good for a lot of reasons. They promote socialization. They also give you the foundation for future training. They will be able to teach you how to keep your dogs attention and even though you are going to class once or twice a week it is your responsibility to work with the dog in between on what he/she has learned in class. So I would highly recommend an Obedience class.

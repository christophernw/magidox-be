Well, where I live Middle School is typically 6th, 7th, and sometimes 8th grade.. Now, in my town, the 9th and 10th were separated from the 11th and 12th. (we called the 9th and 10th, the intermediate high, aka junior high school). Freshman and Sophs weren't seperated for maturity purposes; purely size issues.

What I don't understand is WHY a non-citizen can be allowed to marry a U.S. Citizen in the first place.  If we change our laws, this would help to avoid these kinds of problems to begin with.  These men come to America & seek out women who they can use & exoloit for citizenship, then take the children back to their country & use them as if they were doormats.  I have a good friend who married an Indonesian & as soon as he had the marriage certificate in his hand, he disappeared & left her without so much as a word!  About a year later, he contacts her & orders her to appear at the immigration hearing & wants her to lie.  She refuses & the mans Father calls & harrasses her & her mother about their son & how could she be so cruel.  He offer the Mother money to "persuade" her daughter to fulfill her obligations to her new family because he had no daughters & the wife of his son was to have the "privilege" of caring for him in his old age.  These people have customs that seem to be from the dark ages & our country should stop letting them in until they follow our rules & customs.  They are praying on the daughters of Americans because we have not exposed our children to things we are not aware of.  We must educate our society & our children, before it is too late.  Call the Embassy or the Consulate & insist they take their "trash" home!  Have you turned him in for sexually violating your disabled child?  He sounds like a Predator!

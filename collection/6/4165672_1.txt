I get up every morning between three and four O'clock in the A.M. and, I've been retired for ten years. Do you think I'd like to sleep in? you bet you sweet bippy but, my biological clock that I set about fifty-five years ago when I started school and working, keeps me going. I'm comfortable with this, I've become "used" to it you might say. .   I know being in the medical profession that if I need the sleep, and I have at times, my body will make me sleep that extra time needed.

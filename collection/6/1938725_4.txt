There are several reasons why your dog could be scratching all the time.  Fleas are a good starting point but you say the dog was just groomed so it is unlikely that is the problem.  My next guess would be that maybe the groomers didn't get all of the shampoo rinsed out.  This can cause some dogs to itch and scratch uncontrollably.  Some dogs just itch all of the time and if you ask your groomer to use an oatmeal shampoo or a shampoo with tea tree oil in it that may help and condition them real good or give them a hot oil treatment.  It can take a couple of times of using the new shampoo though before you see any significant results.  Try brushing them at home more often too.  This stimulates the oil glands in their skin and can help with itching.  Allergies would be my next guess.  After you have tried my first shampoo/conditioner suggestions with no luck the next time you go to the groomer ask them to use a hypo allergenic shampoo and not to use any conditioner unless it is medicated or hypo allergenic as well.  If the problem gets better then continue with this in the future.  If it doesn't get any better after trying these suggestions then it is time to go to the vet.  They can run test to tell you if your dog has allergies or not and what those allergies are and if the problem isn't allergies they can give you prescription shampoo and conditioner to help with the problem.

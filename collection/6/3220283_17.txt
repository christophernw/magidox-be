I assume you're talking about illegal immigrants from Mexico coming across our border, right? There's basically three things that keep them coming:. . 1. Once they're here, they can get all kinds of free healthcare, welfare, etc that they didn't get back in Mexico.. 2. They come because they can become "legal" easily enough, and if they're children are born here, they're automatically citizens.. 3. There's work for them here. Farmers hire them because they'll work for less.. . If you eliminate these three things, they'll stop coming so much. These three laws should be passed:. . 1. Illegals are NOT eligible for free healthcare and welfare. They get emergency medical help only, and then they're deported.. 2. You are only a citizen of The United States of America if at least one of your biological parents is a LEGAL resident here, and you are born here.. 3. Make farmers pay major fines for hiring illegals. Right now the fines aren't bad enough, and they're willing to risk  it to get cheap labor. . . Also, it's kind of ironic that Mexico has much stricter immigrations laws than we do. There's nothing wrong with immigration (we're a nation built by immigrants), it's just that when we're flooded with illegal immigrants, lawful tax-paying people like us have to pay for their Welfare and food stamps.. . I think that if someone wants to come to this country badly enough, they should be willing to wait out the legal way. How fair is it that someone immigrating from someplace like China has to wait a long time, and then they have to come over and wait even longer for their family to get accepted, and the whole time they're setting up a place to live and working a job....and meanwhile, there's people from Mexico that do it the illegal way and get food stamps?

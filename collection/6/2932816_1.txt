are you a teen? because all dads know everything up until we are teens then they know nothing after we hit about 21 then we realize they know something after all.  accept your dad for who he is your dad. no one will ever love you more then him.  unless he's done something abusive to you. just accept it because he loves you. <><ANNA<><

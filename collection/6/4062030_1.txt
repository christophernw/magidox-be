it's not that surprising that it caused a labour shortage. I mean 1/3 of the population of Europe died, that's going to create a lot of jobs isn't it? At the time the overwhelming majority of people were peasants so if the majority of them died then there were going to be severe shortages in manpower. This led to a complete change in the way peasants were treated since for the first time, employers had to barter for their services. This was one of the first in a series of land reforms which continued with enclosure in the 16th century.

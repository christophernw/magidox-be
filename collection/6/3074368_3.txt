I think you should get a Japanese version of yahoo mail or hotmail.  I have a hotmail account that I opened with MSN Japan, and I have no problem with receiving email in Japanese, and Japanese and English mixed.  But the thing is, when I send email in Japanese from UK to some Japanese mobile phones, it seems to transform into crazy symbols (called mojibake) so you might still experience some problems...good luck though.

If they tell you they are, they probably are.. Do not guess.. . Human sexuality is more of a sliding scale between heterosexuality and homosexuality than a yes/no assignment.. . In order to have healthy relations, you have to be a little bit homosexual, else your own body would disgust you too much to have sex.. . People who are in the middle of the scale usually resolve to be heterosexual due to the disapproval of society.. People who live as bisexual generally are much farther along toward the homosexual side, as they can't bring themselves to be without homosexual contact, but don't want to be identified as such.. Teens may decide to experiment with their sexuality, especially if they simply have not matured enough to have sexual desires or do not have a clear direction.  You do not have a right to force the decision for them

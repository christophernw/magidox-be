Keep some crackers and ginger ale by the bed.  The minute you wake up and before you even get out of bed, nibble on some bland crackers and sip some ginger ale.  Morning sickness is generally a result of an empty tummy, and the crackers will help your nausea immensely.  Ginger ale is soothing to upset stumachs...and helps wash down the crackers!

Get an attorney and have him/her draft a letter on their letterhead to this harrasive neighbor asking her to cease and desist her behaviour.  This should get the message across that you are not going to tolerate her abusive behavior and are prepared to take legal action.. . Of coarse the other option is to move.  Don't look at it as your neighbor will "win", but as you are taking a step to improve the quality of your life.. . Good Luck!

This means that i will use my strength to serve lord and for his happiness. Other wise i have no other Strength (or no use of Strength). This is the conclusion of Bhagavad Gita. To Use strength to Serve Lord, for the pleasure of the Lord, not worrying if i will fail or succeed, but engaging Strength simply according to the instruction of the lord for Pleasure of the lord.

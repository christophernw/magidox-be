I agree with Angel. I was grocery shopping one day and the black people in front of me in line that had gov. assistance had a lot better choice of food than I did. They are eating better than me, buying those expensive meats, etc. Don't get me wrong, some people need the help, white or black, but there a a lot that can work for it, too. It's a shame that so many don't work and expect to get help from our tax dollars!

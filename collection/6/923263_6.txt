Hebrews 11:1 What is faith? It is the confident assurance that what we hope for is going to happen.  It is the evidence of things we cannot yet see.. . The beginning point of faith is believing in God's character:  He is who he says.  The end point is believing in God's promises:  He will do what he says.  When we believe that God will fulfill his promises even though we don't see those promises materializing yet, we demonstrate true faith (see John 20:24-31).

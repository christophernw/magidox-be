Good Lord, I cannot believe how biased some idiots are against pit bulls.  They're sweet if you actually train them and don't just let them run loose. >=(. All dogs eat wood, my adult yellow lab does.  She likes the taste, and I'm fine with it because it cleans her teeth at the same time! =)  All dogs chew wood- it's normal for them!  Just like sniffing each other's butts...

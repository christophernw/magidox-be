well i cant say but i don't think much about it, i think that maybe there I.C.B.M. missile technology is like 10-15 years less advanced than the U.S.A. or Russia, also there guidance systems are second rate based on 20 year old Russian technology, plus  that much radiation can cause trajectory errors to develop over a short period of time, that and the S.D.I. helps me sleep better. as for how to deal with them, just let them do what there doing until they mess up, and ask for help to fix there mess, them go in and seize all there nukes.

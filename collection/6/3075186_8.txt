Good and evil are labels. So to determine what can be considered as either label you must give definitions to the labels of good and evil. Most people believe in general definitions of good and evil but I have yet to hear of more than two people being able to agree on a single definition of what they believe is good or evil. The first step to answering this question is determing what is good and evil. I would really recommend you reading "The Euthephro" by plato he comes to some good ideas and breaks some misconceptions about good, evil, and god. . . Honestly, I still have absolutely no idea of what good and evil are. I kinda just go with the flow and do my best each day in the way that makes the most sense to all that is me.

This is NOT an issue of censorship. Yahoo! owns this site and has the right and responsibility to make sure it is a safe place for everyone. If you don't like their guidelines, you can create your own site, but no company has a obligation to publish profanities. And this is NOT an adults-only site. There are children here, some very young, and they should not be subjected to language that is inappropriate in a public place. And the use of profanities lowers the overall quality of questions and answers. Anyone who has to resort to profanities lacks the education, manners, intelligence, and creativity needed for civil discourse.

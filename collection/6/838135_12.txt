That isn't entirely true. Some music was created by crackers and most by blacks, but white people did invent a lot of machines that help the world today. Without Asians, Whites, Black, etc. people there wouldn't be the world there is today. Life would not exist. Honestly I think that everyone is being very racist--every culture, sex, or color of the skin--did do something amazing that another culture, sex, or color could not do, or never would have accomplished. So message to all the people out there, "I'm fu*king better than you! Nothing is bigger than my ego, than my talent! So cut all the bull sh*t, move on with your life, and don't be a RACIST! I may have an ego, but do you see me being as racist as you?". cheers and beers!

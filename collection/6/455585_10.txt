I force myself not to seelp for at least 14 hours, no naps at all. Then after 14 hours when its aroung 9-10 pm , I will feel very tired and I can sleep til tomorrow 8-9am. From then I make sure I use my day wisely, no afternoon naps at all until at night bedtime. Repeat it for a week and most probably your body clock will get back to normal.

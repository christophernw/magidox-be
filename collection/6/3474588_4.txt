Mine wanted me or my mom and hated its cage.  it would go nuts if it would see me or my mom outside. It loved Whole Lot of Love by Led Zepplin, totally freaked out when she would hear that song.  That song totally wore that bird out. It would also wake up up in the morning by jumping on my head and chew on my ear.

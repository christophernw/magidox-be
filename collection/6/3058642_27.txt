A woman who has more than one partner/husband is called a polyandrist.Women are generally very good at strocking the male ego,so they think its a mans world and they can do as they like,what they dont know is that two can play the game,we just dont brag about it or anounce to the world what we are upto.. But what a man can do,a woman can do better,or is it cheat better,or share better?

My wife has the same thing in her hand. I know its not dangerous because they no longer make pencils out of lead. But I wonder why it won't dissolve or soak into your skin..    I'll do some research on this and add a new message to this. Keep an eye out for it.. .    Well I though I could find more information than this but it seems that people really do not know how to remove it. And it is made out of Graphite not coal or lead or charcoal or any other thing. The reason the use Graphite is because test have shown that it is not dangerous to the human body. Some one must have had a child just like you and my wife. LOL. . . . Here is a web sight were a few other people had a discussion about it. http://chocnvodka.blogware.com/blog/life/_archives/2004/8/3/117908.html. . If I find any new info I will shoot it to you.

Listen, we aren't afraid of it. The higher-ups as well as many others are just disgusted with the fact that Dan Brown and the movie portray these events as facts which they aren't true.. . How dare you start bashing a religion that you are not a part of. I would never intentionally start bashing your religion because I would never want someone to bash the Catholic Church.. . Thank you to Bibs and Ben P. for defending Catholicism.

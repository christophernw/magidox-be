Go to your nearest pet store and ask them for Xtreme Super Concentrated Liquid Catnip.  So far I have had not seen a cat that can resist it.  Spray it on all of your scratching posts, or on his food, or anything you want him to play with, eat, rub on or scratch.  It costs about 7 dollars for a bottle but well worth it if you can get his attention re-directed from your couch.

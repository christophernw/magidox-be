You know, I don't know how we could go about that, but I really want to thank you for proposing it. If you find that a petition is a good start, I will be the second to sign it(following you, I'm sure). I have ideas that may would make the process quicker and easier, but I dare not say them because I'm not crazy or ballsy enough to carry it out, nor would I want to be investigated simply for creatively stating my opinion.

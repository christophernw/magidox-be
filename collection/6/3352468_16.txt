I've managed to have my cake & eat it for most of my life - metaphorically AND in real life. You see, "can't have your cake & eat it" is only another way of saying that you can't have everything your way in life - but if you push hard enough (& make enough cakes), then you CAN indeed turn life in your direction.. . *You may lose a lot of friends along the way, but it IS possible.

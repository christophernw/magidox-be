It's a college placement test. Depending on ur SAT scores, u might be able to get into a GOOD college, or just settle and go to an ok college and take their placement test. If u want to go out of state, or to an IV Leage Institution, SAT's are important, so then they can place u according to ur tests once ur accepted, or deny u, before u come all the way out there for nothing. They're hard, but people say it's worth taking them.

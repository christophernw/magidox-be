Probably trying to psyche you out...... or its entirely possible that said feline master is simply staring THROUGH you and you're just getting in the way. . Some cats aren't inherantly trusting... and its entirely possible that the one in question just simply doesn't trust you enough to take his / her eyes off you yet. . . Just don't do anything stupid, carry on as normal, and it should be fine. Certainly do NOT do anything that could be perceived as suspicious..... as that will only make it more extreme.. . Of course dependant on HOW said feline is staring, he / she could just be trying to get your attention..... Some cats will stare as a means of passive communication.... and in those cases it means: "Get over here and pamper me you incompetant ape!" ...

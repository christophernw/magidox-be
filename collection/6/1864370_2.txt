Streangth training increses the muscle streagth of your body. When you increase muscle streagth, you are able to lift heavier objects without overstraining your body. Cheerleaders do an awful lot of lifting, of people :-) and the ones being lifted are not stationary, they wiggle and move around a lot. Streangth training also teaches or trains your body in proper form when lifting weight. That helps a lot when you are lifting wiggling amd moving bodies. It is important so you don't hurt yourself or others while lifting people up into the air.

I work 21 miles from where I live,. I can't realisticly ride there in a timely manor,. even if I thought I could,. The traffic is frightenting,. where i Live a lot of trucks go through, and for some reason, theythink the speed limit doesn't apply to them. as well as their size means they drive right on the edge of the road. ( the wind from a truck can knock you over easy) not to mention many of them drive tired because they make money based on how much they drive.. . also, there is not a lot of places to put a bike when out and about.. . I used to enjoy riding a bike when I lived in the country for fun,. but if I have chores to do, I need to be on a schedule that is a litte quicker.

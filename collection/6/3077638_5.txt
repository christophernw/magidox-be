Better diet, especially highly refined foods like sugars and bread products made with refined flour. Eat mostly fresh fruits and vegetables. . . Keep regular hours. Get up at the same time every day, and go to bed at the same time too. Budget yourself extra time in bed, instead of squeezing in "just enough" sleep.. . Get some exersize every day, like  brisk 20 minute walk. Don't listen to music or worry about problems when you walk, just walk and look at your surrounding.. . Go study somewhere that there are fewer distractions. I can get a lot better studying done at the library than at home.

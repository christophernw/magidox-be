Are the friends you have now good and loyal?  Do you like them and respect them? Are you comfortable with them? If yes, you are lucky.  The quality of your friendships is more important than the quantity.  People like those  who genuinely like and respect themselves, do you? If yes, great!  If no--that's an area to look into and work on.  You cannot change others, but you can achieve your dream by projecting the nicest and the best you possible.  Good luck!

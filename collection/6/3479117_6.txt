Please go to the doctor. I am like you and i have Crohn's Disease which means i have to have regular blood tests, and regular vists to the hosital. I was diagnosed in January after months of pain, vomiting and diahhorea. I left it so long that i was so sevely dehydrated that my organs where starting to fail. and i spent a month in hospital getting normal agian. PLEASE learn from my mistake and go. Its better to catch something early than to mess about like me!

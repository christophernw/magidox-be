Why do we have to listen to pro-war dogma. . Our t.v's newspapers are full this, the press is daisy yellow. Jingoism is alive and well.. The whole act of protest is problem solving. Protest stimulates debate which in turn informs people about the two sides to an argument, which in a "free society" is important in the overall preservation of democracy.. Read a book.. As far as protesters wanting t.v time, do you really believe they have a monopoly on t.v time, hardly.. Why do you characterise demonstrations as silly. How do you think your country, America go out from under the yoke of Britain was it by sitting idly by. Your country would be embracing crumpets and crickets if bum kissers like you had their way.. Think before you write my friend. You question is rhetorical and baseless.. . oh and by the way, have you thought about how protest brought about the end of the Vietnam war and gave women the right to vote, helped workers get fair wages and fair treatment among other things. . I would laugh at your childish rhetoric, but it is actually very sad.. . As far as supporting troups, I find it distasteful that anyone would applaud a baby killer.. Also how has American bombs and policy helped Iraq?. They are in a state of civil war(sorry I don't agree with Bush's assessment that it is not). It is just as bad as it was under Hussein, the only difference is more bodies.

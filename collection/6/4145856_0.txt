I know there are a lot of immigrants that are not white.  The reason people focus on Mexicans is because they are trying to use racism to get their own way with immigration laws.  Also Mexicans make up the majority of immigrants to the united states and they are relatively well organized when it comes to protesting.  This makes them more of a threat to the white American way of life.

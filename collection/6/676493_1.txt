I live in the UK and our police are not armed. They therefore come up with other activities instead of knocking off pensioners. These are all real timewasters played by the police.. . 1. Car snooker. The driver and passenger take it in turns to pull over cars dependant on there color. If they make an arrest they get the points. 1 point for red 7 for black cars etcetc. The points system works by a reduction system starting at 20. The other normal rules of snooker apply.. . 2. Coasting. This is where the two policemen take it in turns to put the car innuetral and coast for as far as possible. This would be done from the top of a hill. My "contact" says he has covered 3 miles and is in 4th place at the station. There are loads more but that is the jist of it. . . Taxes well spent

because now that the dog urinates anywhere even furniture, they've actually marked their territory. now the urine scent is deep rooted w/in the furniture. dog's have an awesome sense of smell, so they can continue smelling their scent on the furniture. they'll continue going on & to the same spot.. it takes quite a while, a long time for the urine scent to go away. to the dog's though, it may never go away. the more the dog pee's in that same particular spot: the scent will remain.. throw away the furniture & get new ones.. what you do is, put the dogs nose in the area, speak firmly no: no pee-pee, then put the dog outside to go. you can also spank the dog in the booty softly w/a newspaper too. that's b/4 putting the dog outside.

It just happens to have a low boiling point (NOT flash point, which only refers to ignition of vapor), way below room temperature. There are many common gases with similar properties like propane, butane and ammonia gas. They all require compression to exist in the liquid state at room temperature. Other gases are more conveniently stored cold and compressed, since their boiling point is even lower, such that at room temperature they either can't exist as a liquid at all or would require too high a pressure to be practical.

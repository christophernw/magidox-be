I think that's  a good question but a better question is why so many countries ask the United states to get involved..?The Americans have a saying Caught between a rock and a hard place..in other words Damn if they do damn if they don't !!. Its a price perhaps for it being to days only superpower,,and. it wasn't always like that!!

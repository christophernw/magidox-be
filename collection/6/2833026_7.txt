The life of any human being is what they choose to make of it. People should be glad that they're not from another planet because if they were then they'd either be treated like a frog in a Science class or destroyed.. What this country should be doing is getting rid of those two catagories that sets us all apart. Seniorities and minorities. This world is programmed to believe that because there are more of one race on this earth that those are the people that should run it. We're all the same. Let's run this world together in peace and harmony.

When you dissolve a non-volitile solute (like antifreze) in a solvent (like water), it lowers the vapor pressure of the overall solution.. . A liquid will boil when its vapor pressure equals the pressure above the liquid.  At a given temperature, the vapor pressure of a solution is constant.  So if you lower the vapor pressure by dissolving something in the water, you are raising its boiling point.

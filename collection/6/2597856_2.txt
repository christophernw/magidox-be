That's an interesting question,i've prayed for my frends that God will open their ears to hear the gospel.But so far i don't think any have come to Christ.. Should we keep praying for them?,i don't know for sure.The Bible say's(somewhere)not to throw your pearls to pigs.Maybe He heard us the first time,we just have to wait for His perfect timing.

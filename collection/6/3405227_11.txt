As a student in education, i feel i can offer you some actual advice and a non-bias response.. Teachers set homework as a way of ensuring a child has consolidated skills we have taught throughout that specific lesson. It ensures the child is either attempting it without outside distractions/temptations to share answers.. Alongside these facts, it is to incorporate the assistance of parents within their childs education. It allows the child to become aware of the role of their parents, but also allows the parents to gain insight with their childs talents.

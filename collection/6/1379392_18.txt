there is one thing people are leaving out when they tell you about praying to God (and i am not just pulling this out of my butt...i promise). when one comes to God, through christ, one must be convicted by the holy spirit. i cannot mathematically explain this to you...but it is a testimony you will hear from every born-again through christ.. . personally, i went to church for quite awhile, but christ was a million miles from my heart, and so was truth.. . it took a drastic and serious circumstance in my life to awaken me spiritually take my relationship with God seriously.. . no one can genuinely come to christ unless the holy spirit convicts that person as it says in scripture). when this happens..the gates of god's love overflow. not only does it say this in the bble...but there is testimony to this of countless born-again christians.. . God will let you in heaven if you genuinely accept christ as your ransom for sin. if you do not feel you have sin..or are not sorry for your sin....the holy spirit has not convicted you. . . i hope this helps friend. take care.

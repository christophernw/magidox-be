The Yarqon River or Yarkon River (Hebrew: נחל הירקון) is a river in Israel that originates in north Petah-Tikva and flows into the Mediterranean Sea. It is the largest coastal river in Israel, at 27.5 km in length. It runs through seven cities, including Tel Aviv.. . On July 16, 1997, four members of the Australian delegation to the Maccabia Games were killed as a result of a bridge collapsing into the Yarqon. Over 100 other people were on the bridge at the time of the collapse, but survived.. . The Yarqon was also found to contain excessive amounts of toxins, and therefore Israelis were banned from bathing or fishing in it on multiple occasions. The river is administered by the Yarqon River Authority.

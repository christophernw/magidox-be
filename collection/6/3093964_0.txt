Seems a little convoluted.. . It means that f(x) is an element of the set.  Since the set has only one element it means that f(x) = 3.  This is only true for one value of x, right?. . The set of (x,y) pairs that make f(x) = 2x-3 true is the line.  The statement g(x) = 3 is the line (x,3) for any real x.  The intersection of those two sets is (3,3), right?. . There's a clearer way:  f(x) is an element of {3} for some x.  Which means there's a value of x such that f(x) =3.

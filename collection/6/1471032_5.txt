See a doctor. It could be something minor (hemorrhoids like others have said), but it could be something more serious: colitis, crohn's, polyps, cancer.... you need to see a specialist (gastroenterologist) so they can rule out things like bugs/viral infections/bacterial infections and find out what's up. And if you're losing a somewhat significant amount of blood, you need to get your hemoglobin levels checked out to make sure you're not becoming anemic.. . Better to go in and subject yourself to tests, only to find out that it was 'just a roid' (as someone else put it) than to put it off and have it be something more serious/life threatening.. . Good luck.

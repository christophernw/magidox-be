they are most likely going to be red blisters that will scab in a week but may not heal for quite some time, covering only on one side of the body...usually will show up on the back or i have seen them on the arm.. Shingles come from the chicken pox virus that has laid dormant in the nerves, this will cause alot of pain and pain meds dont really work since it is nerve pain...there is no medication to cure it, but valtrex may be perscribed to shorten the duration of the shingles. It is a form of herpes.(herpes zoster)

I think you mean protestant. The Protestant Reformation took place in Europe during the sixteenth century.  This movement is where Martin Luther comes into being famous.  The only REAL church at the time was the Catholic Church, and they gave services only in LATIN.  The commoners did not speak LATIN and so could not follow and understand all the services.  Martin Luther was a priest in the Catholic Church who believed it was wrong to have Latin services if the church patrons could not understand latin.  He posted his disagreements (called the Luther Theses) on the Cardinal's front door (Cardianls are very high leaders, almost as high as the POPE).  Well, he was excommunicated for going against the Catholic Church.  So, he and some other like-minded individuals in Europe founded a new church away from the Catholic Church and they gave the same services as the Catholic Church but not in Latin, they did it in the common tongue of the peasants and merchants.  Therefoer, this movement was bringing God to the uneducated masses, not just to the educated (and therefore rich) people who understood and spoke LATIN.. . Therefore, over the years, new churches arose called denominations of the Christian Church.  Today, there are 3 major denominations of the Christian Church: Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox.  There are also dozens of subgroups within each denomination (except in catholicism which is still the only, ONE, "true" Church).  To this day, Catholic leaders only consider Catholic Churches as the "true" Christian Church.  Although, the Protestants and the Orthodox Christians would disagree.. . So, protestants were rebels from the Catholic Church who lost favor with their leaders and formed their own churches.  All the Christian denominations other than CATHOLICISM grew from that one incident.

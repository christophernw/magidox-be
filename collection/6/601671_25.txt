You must not get out much. There are a lot of hard working white, black, and all other colors of people for that matter, working side by side in the hot sun every day in my county. Construction jobs, landscaping, etc. Take a good look, you jerk, before you start pointing fingers. It isn't only the "Mexicans" doing hard jobs here. And, for the record, it isn't "Mexicans" I am so angry about -- it is ILLEGALS.. . Maybe you can understand it better this way:  If you are sitting in your house watching TV and then you noticed that there are 50 people in your living room that you didn't invite into your home. When you ask them to leave, they blow up at you and exclaim that "This is their house now". They won't leave your living room.  What are you going to do?  Get angry?  What?  Try to look at this situation on a more simplified level, then see if it affects you.

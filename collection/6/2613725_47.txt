Actually....the truth of the matter is....God is not hiding....He is a Holy God and cannot be among the unholy or unclean, since we were born into sin, He keeps seperated from us physically but not spiritually, hence the advent of the Messiah and His supreme sacrifice...and He sent the Holy Spirit to be our comforter....anyhow, if He revealed Himself we would all be dead, which will happen sooner or later....read Matthew chapter 24....

Because they represent dark and hiden stuff - even in the way they dress, when you look at them it seems like they call themself - dark.. And dark has always been scary, so, i wouldn't say discriminated, but i think we try to avoid them.. I'm a very positive person, and i don't enjoy the dark point of view, not from them but from anybody.

Ok there....this is serious and very important....you need to get ahold of that CC company and have then set up a credit monitor on that card..(actually it will monitor your entire credit)....this type of fraud is totally out of control and let me tell you there is no hell on earth quite like this.  The good news is that you are typically not responsible for a credit card that gets run up...why??  I don't know....just give then a call pronto!!!

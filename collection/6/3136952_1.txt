Advaita may seem like a philosophy on the outside (it is practiced as a religious stream by many Hindus) but this may very well be the place where Scientific world intersects with the Spiritual world. Many of us are aware of the Plancks equation E = hv where E = Energy of a wave and h = Planck's constant and v = frequency of the wavelength. With the arrival of Einstein it was also established that E = mc^2 where E = energy and m = mass of a particle and c = speed of light. . . When we combine the two equations we get mc^2 = hv which gives us a very interesting relation which directly relates the mass of a particle to frequency which means anything material has an associated wavelength namely De Broglie waves . To sum up matter is another form of waves which in turn is another form of energy and so on.In fact it so appears that the whole mesh of this Universe is in fact blending into that One which exhibits itself as many (namely mass energy wave etc). This is where Advaita takes over to explain that everything is but the manifestation of that "One" which is omnipresent omniscient and omnipotent. Even the concept of these fundamental waves is seen in Hindu (and consequently Advaita) belief as Aum .

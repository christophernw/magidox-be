Some people seem to think the brown eggs have less cholesterol or more protein or something in them.  In reality, the only difference is the color of the shell, which is determined by the chicken.  The same chicken will only lay white or brown, not both.  There are some breeds that lay green or blue ones too.  I grew up eating "yard eggs".  My grandmother had chickens and all the eggs had a darker yellow yolk.  They also had a better flavor (in my opinion) than what you get at the store now.  It all depends on what the chickens eat.

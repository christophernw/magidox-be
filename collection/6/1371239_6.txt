You must be a pretty little thing just into your teens. At this time one does and should also feel that he is the first thinker . Those preceding him were all pulled by their noses by blindly accepted ways of life.The straighforward answer to your query is that there is absolutely no objection too live life in single blessedness provided one could. And pdople have also did.. . That is the position and apparently further answering your question must stop at this point.The difficulty is that not all people are able to lead a solitary life. They crave for company. It is not necessarily for  sex though there is nothing intrincially wrong if one desired it for that purpose. And many do.Though this does not necesssarily mean that one need to enter into a social contract,say marriage, for this. One could as well have a live-in  relationship.Unless care is t aen to avoid pregnancy the incoming traffic needs to be regulated .EVen though a single mother or father can and do rig up children the lack of familial atmosphere sometimes stunts their growth again dissuading from leading a singleton life.. . So if you can really do it by all means go and lead a life as a single individual.

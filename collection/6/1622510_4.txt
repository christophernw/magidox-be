Hi, I believe the difference is that when someone is famous they are due to either being royalty, or an actress etc, an infamous is a person who is known in certain circles because their reputation preceeded them, such as al copone, i think he was infamous, although i dont think its all negative, it can also relate to someone who has been around many years and is known for something in particular,im hoping this is right.

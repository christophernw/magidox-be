I came up with this when I was 9 but I still think it makes sense: Since dark colours attract or ``absorb``sunlight and that light colours reflect it, I think that people with lighter eye colour are more likely to be blinded by sunlight compared with people who have darker eyes.. . Rationale: I the case of light eyes, The sunlight goes straight to the pupil of the eyes since there is no dark colour around it to absorb a portion of it. For darker irises, it absorbs a portion of the sunlight so not all of it goes straight into the pupil.. . Comparable to the  principle by which football players are drawing black marks under their eyes.

Many places on-line allow you to enter in your rent and desired amenities. Try doing a Google search for real estate rentals in your city.. . If that doesn't work, get in touch with a community group that helps low income women with things like this. They will probably be able to help you find a place and use their facilities to contact land lords. Many will even provide free child care while you visit possible rentals.. . Good luck!

Big Bang was as imaginative as Creation theory.  Evolution have too many missing link.  . Creation have more evidence than Big Bang, and thus I accepted it.. . I am a science student.  In my chem, physic & Bio classes, my teachers used to say that we can test the theory, and in ideal condition, the theory stays true.. . None of the theory of Big Bang and Evolution can be tested, can how we ever call it a science?. . I'm not into picking up all the flaws or to talk about the mission link.  However, if you are interested to know more, perhaps you may email to me at mel.greywolf@gmail.com.. . Regards

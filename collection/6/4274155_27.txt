Not to belittle you, but you put 2 goldfish in a vase. Goldfish don't do well in bowls, small containers or vases. They need a tank, filter, heater, and most important a air pump. They need a lot of air because of their size. They are most likely staying at the bottom because they can't breath or because it's not wide. You seem like you really care about te goldfish, I would recommend that you buy a 10 gallon tank for starters, a air pump, filter, and heater as soon as possible.

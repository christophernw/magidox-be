Hi, first of all you need to keep the area around your eyes very clean , you need to get a bottle of witch hazel water it only cost about three dollars and you can find it at your local pharmacy.. you will need to wash you face with just water then pure some witch hazel water in your hands and splash it on your face you can leave your eyes open , it will sting a little but its OK, then take a towel and pat around you eyes ,, you need to do this about 4 times a day , you should start to feel better by the next day ,at the same time it will really help you get rid of you pink eye fast ,, . if you feel that its not getting better ,then you will need to get medical attention , . hope that you feel better soon .. good luck.

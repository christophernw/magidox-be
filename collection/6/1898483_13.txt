Martin Luther King Jr. was important because he not only made a contribution to the civil rights movement, he did it peacefully. He did everything without violence, and what he preached, he lived by. That is why he is important. I am guessing that you are not black, (no offense) because it is really common knowledge that every person knows. Black, white, hispanic, asian, whatever.

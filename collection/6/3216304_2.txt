There is no valor in dying in the least common denominator; you don't get points for dying better. It is war..  Why fight an enemy face to face when you can bomb said enemy;kill 1,000 of them and let you live to drop the next bomb? I love the romantic appeal that you make that you want to go man- e mano with the enemy; But why? They are the enemy, there's no point system in war, do you really think they're thinking as they are dying "Damn, that guy was not good at ground combat, I shouldn't die, but ...."   Who gives a rat's ass if you're good at ground combat when you beat the enemy?

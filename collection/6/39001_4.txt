cats are stubborn- she may not like the scent of the litter or it may not be private enough for her - try locking the bathroom door she she does not have a choice in the matter - also she may be allergic to the litter , like I am - try an unscented brand- if this fails then she is truly doing it to annoy you very catty indeed

The Fox news and talk radio do as well as they do,ratings-wise, because there is finally something to watch from a conservative bias.  That's why Air America has lower ratings than the static on the next channel up..     There was one bias on 3 networks for decades preceding this.  As far as I am concerned, one way or the other, left right, or otherwise, unbiased, truly objective reporting is impossible.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that to be honest.  I won't bother citing examples of mainstream bias, as that can be easily googled or wiki'd.

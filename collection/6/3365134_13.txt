They believe in infant baptism.. . That is a brief nutshell.. . However the main importance is that they both believe in the trinity, believe in salvation through Jesus Christ, that he was the Messiah and that he died on the Cross and rose again three days later.. . Catholic churches will excomunicate members of their church for various reasons.  They will also deny membership for various reasons (divorce, out of wedlock children, etc)

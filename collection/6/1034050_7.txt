It's the greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide) theory.  Carbon dioxide holds the heat in more, so it doesn't radiate back into space as easily.. . The carbon dioxide that used to be in the atmosphere long ago was taken in by plants and turned into solid forms of carbon through photosynthesis.  These plants containing this carbon were buried underground and became petroleum.. . Less CO2 left in the atmosphere lead to cooler temperatures.  But now, like opening "Pandora's box," we are opening the ground up and allowing these carbon dioxide demons to escape from the underground hell that once confined them--to again roam the earth--ruling in terror, like they did in days of yore.

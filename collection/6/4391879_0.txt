I did check the above answerers answers, and they are wrong :P. a,b,c,d,e,f = 1,2,5,5,4,6.. You could go and solve this by the usual elimination methods, but for something this large its far better to use a calculator or online solver. Google for 'simultaneous equation solver' and you'll find  heaps.. (Just to confirm above answers are wrong: for those numbers you get 4a + b + 5d + 2e + 3f = 69, not 57.)

I think that other religions do preach their belief.  Christians think that their way is the only right way and that if you don't believe their way then your damned.  So, many Christians see it as their mission to convert and "save" as many people as possible.  . Other religions, like Buhddism and Hinduism, believe that there are different paths to the divine and we each must find our own way.  These religions tend to be more respectful and tolerant of others.

I hate to tell you, but you just may lose her. This shouldn't keep you from telling her, but it will determine who your real friends are and who isn't. I had a huge problem like that. I tried to come out when I was 14 and I lost all of my friends and I had to start from scratch. Then I tried again when I was 18 and just getting out of high school, but the good thing was there were a few who stuck around and those are the ones who I keep close to my heart today. They accept for who I am, and don't judge me for any reason.. So while you may lose her as a friend, you might realize you never needed her in the first place at all. And who knows, she may open her eyes and put her past prejudices aside.

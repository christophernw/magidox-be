"Vizier" has been used to designate the person and the institution who represented the ruler towards his subjects. The vizier was in many respects the prime minister of his time. The term comes from old Iranian Pahlavi v√ßir which was used for a judge.. The 2 main empires which used the institution of vizier were the Abbasids (750 CE- 1258) and the Ottomans (1300-1922). The term "vizier" has also been used for the head of the administration in Ancient Egypt from around 2575 BCE. But the Egyptians never used the term "vizier" themselves, this is a term modern historians have used when translating.

well I was tol it was a slam dunk . i was told there un manned planes capeable of carrying wmd. i was  duppued to believe that iraq was directly involved w 9/11 and all it's tragedies . i was told by  colin powel that they knew that iraq had wmds and where they were . i was told that( by colin powel) " these aluminium tubes are used for the direct manufacture of wmd's".  . I was told (by Colin Powell) "see this vial?  In this vial there is enough agent to kill many people".  . I was told that in order to strike a blow for Qualing terrorism it's better to act proactively against Iraq.. Okay, you get my drift.  . I'm a Democrat, love my country and a professional, and I do have common sense.  But . . . what has happened?  Irregardless of your political affiliation, here's facts.  . No WMDs.. No manned planes.. No slam dunk.. No concrete evidence of the aluminum tubes "used specifically for the manufacture of WMDs".. There is even question of what the hell was in that vial that Colin Powell held up (okay, I'll give him that one; I guess you can't have VX in a room full of senators - LOL).. All of us were behind the President.  Every country was on our side and still behind us and were there for us.  But, instead of going where we knew there were key elements to 911 and the tragedies of that day, we took the "slam dunk" route (I hope all of you out there do not forget "slam dunk" "Mission Accomplised") because, again, irregardless of your political affiliation, those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it.  It might be a Democrat who does that next time.  And you know what?  It really doesn't matter why we went to Iraq, what matter is this:  Approximately 2,500 or 2,600 to this day (5/31/06) dead American Soldiers.  Approximately 10K + wounded, women and men.  For the rest of their lives . . . for what.

Speaking completely in generalities, people are quick to judge others. In a "democracy" like ours where faith and morality have become the most important issues, people see any sex offense as permanently scarring, if not unpardonable. This is not to say, like you mentioned above, that all of these offenses should be pardoned. Until society undergoes a paradigm shift and is willing to admit that anyone who commits a crime has the potential to reform himself and stops perpetuating the problem by locking people up where they only commit worse crimes, we are lost. The whole concept of forgiveness is lost on most people: it apparently only applies when they want it themselves to ease their conscience. Forcing people to "register" with the government so that people can be alerted for these types of crimes only opens the door for more of the same. Don't you want to be sent an email every time someone with a speeding ticket moves into your neighborhood? You wouldn't want that monster speeding down the street and running over your child, would you? We have to protect our neighborhoods, after all.

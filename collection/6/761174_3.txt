I don't know. This is the first I've heard of this. My guess is it's probably because everybody has to go back to work after stuffing themselves the day before. Who wants to go back to work after a big celebration meal like that???? You have to stay at home and let it marinate in your tummy, then go back and fill it up again. My estimation is it takes at least 3 days to celebrate Thanksgiving!LOL!!

Uncap Our oil wells. We have plenty of Our own oil but the libleft  won't vote yes to open them up. We are working on alternatives but its gonna be a long time before we get there, so if we don't start drilling Our own and start modernizing Our refineries the price is just gonna keep on going up. You can't have it both ways.

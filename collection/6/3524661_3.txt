The Aircraft turns while flying using its ailerons, not the rudder( the rudder is use to control the yaw effect that is caused when turning) http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/rotations.html (check this out). . Now that you know what the angle of banking in an aircraft is( by previous answers), FYI,  there is a apparatus called "turn and bank indicator" this electronic device will give you the banking angle as well as the time that the aircraf will take to turn 180 Degrees. Eg: 1, 2, minutes.

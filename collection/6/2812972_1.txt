Your idea has merit, no doubt.. . There is too much vehicle ownership, and everyone wants that big, fat, bloated piece of crap they make so as to see above everyone else and believe they are king of the road.  . . Something has to give, and is happening...more and more accidents than ever before.. . A complete shake-down of the way we buy automobiles, how we use them, who is qualified to drive them, and why a small female has to sit in a two ton pickup and go nowhere in traffic.. . You are on the right track.. . I hope the old f---ts we elected to Congress see it your way, and start making needed changes.. . Everyone's driving, and going nowhere...FAST!.. . Good business for the undertaker, though.

The only true way is to ask.  Other than that, you can tell by the questions they ask you (if they're interested in you) and if you're observant.....the way they interact around men and women.  My girlfriend suggested to me that a typical man wouldn't know the first thing about women's clothing / shoes / cologne.  That has some truth to it, but there are some men that know a little about it.  Her statement was more on the side of a man commenting on a woman "wearing last month's ********* (clothes / shoes / cologne).  Use your discression.  Ask.  Observe.

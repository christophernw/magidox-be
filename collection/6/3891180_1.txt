Per "Oxford Dictionary of Current English, Third Edition": . Flea- " A small wingless jumping insect which feeds on the blood of mammals and birds.". Tick- " A tiny creature related to the spiders, which attaches itself to the skin and sucks blood.". Respectfully, I believe what they "eat" is in both definitions.

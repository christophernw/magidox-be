In 1997 I suddenly lost my child in an auto accident. For a while I simply didn't exist. All I did was go to work and get through the day,then go home and sleep. I also took an antidepressant for a while, The only thing that really helped is time to pull yourself back together. and good friends to see you through.. I am doing much better now.

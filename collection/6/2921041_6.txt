pi is an irrational number, which is approximately equal to 3.1415926535.  pi appears in the formula A=pi*r*r, where A is the area of a circle and r is its radius.  it also occurs in the formula C=pi*d, where C is the circumference of a circle and d is its diameter.  one method of approximating pi is pi/4=1- (1/3)+ (1/5)- (1/7)+ (1/9) +...  the volume of a sphere is (4/3)*pi*r^3, and the surface area of a sphere is 4*pi*r^2.. pi is also used to measure angles.  the radian system uses 2*pi radians instead of 360 degrees to measure angles.

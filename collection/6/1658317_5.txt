Chorus is a good place to start. You'll also want to look at private lessons. The more practice you get, the better you'll be. Are you still in school then? Look for a talent show at our school or in your area to start with. That will get you some experience.. . For more experience, which is another aspect of the career you'll need in order to move forward in your career, try auditioning for the school play and any local musical theatre groups. I know, I know, that isn't what you want. But the AUDITION part is really why you're going there. The more of those you survive, the more polished you'll be to pursue your dream. Look for open mic coffee houses, clubs, and bars (wit restaurants, since you're underaged!). Go to Karoake whenever possible, have Karaoke parties at your house, too. All of this will help you learn how to sing in front of crowds.. . Every town has fairs, right? A lot of singers start by performing at Farmer's Market Nights, Fairs, and local festivals. Faire crowds want you to do well, so this is a great chance to practice. . . Are you a church person? A LOT of churches have functions where you could sing.. . Tell friends, family, neighbors, teachers, ministers, anyone in your community that you will sing at weddings for people. Then with your private singing coach you can work up a repetoire of wedding songs. Volunteer at first, but as you get better at it, you can start charging money!!!!. . Good luck with this dream. Shows like American Idol make it seem like being a famous star is so easy, just go down and audition. But what they don't always show the TV audience is that most of those who "make it" have had TONS of experience AND training!!!!

Just keep practicing and it will come.  I know this may sound like a bunch of hoopla, but its true.  It will take a long time.  But, eventually you will notice that you are improving.  Also, don't worry about what they are thinking when you speak.  Pretend that you are talking to someone who has no doubts about what you are saying.  Maybe you don't realize it but maybe you are thinking in the back of your mind that they aren't buying what you are saying and so it comes off like that.  Hope this helps.

The way to do this, is to know what your prejudices and stereotypical views are (Make a list maybe) Then work on telling yourself that it is not true.. . If your problem is with having stereotypical views think NO not every one with that characteristic is the same, as everyone is an individual and sharing the same... as another person or group does not mean that they will all act in a similar manner.. . Everybody has them, but people that know what theirs are can mask them better.

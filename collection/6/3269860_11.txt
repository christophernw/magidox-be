I don't think anyone except Rangel actually wants to see a draft. . . He's an idiot.  . . That has nothing to do with being a liberal, it's a quality totally unrelated to politics.  He's just an idiot. . . Being an idiot and being for the draft are not necessarily synonymous. I am not saying all people who favor a draft are idiots.  Some are merely totally ignorant of the purpose of the military and the effect a draft will have on the ability to achieve that purpose.  Rangel, however, is not merely ignorant, because his position has put him where there is no excuse for lacking this information.  In fact, he seems very much aware of the effect it will have on the military, and this is apparently part of his intended purpose. . . The only way to explain this is that he's an idiot.

Well I think you need to be direct with him, passive agressive not answering the phone is stressful to you and not fair to him.  Next time he calls, just say "Look, I know we kissed, and I don't want to hurt you, but there was no chemistry between us because I'm a lesbian.  I'm sorry, and I would still like to be friends, but I understand if you don't".  It is unpleasant to say, but it will take you less then a minute to clear this up if you just bite the bullet and do it.

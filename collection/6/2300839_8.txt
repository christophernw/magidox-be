APOSTLE PAUL GIVES YOU THE ANSWER AT:  HEBREWS 10:23,24,25. . . 23 Let us hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful that promised. 24 And let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, 25 not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as YOU behold the day drawing near.

Unfortunately that will never happen.There (historically) has been little tolerances among religions ever.In today's society things like religious tolerances like racial acceptance has to be taught in the home,we must allow children to find their OWN paths to God-no matter what God that is.By not allowing children to do so,or not letting them research other religious beliefs we make them intolerant of others beliefs.example-Have you ever heard a "Christian" preacher say it was a beautiful thing to be a Muslim? Or Wiccan? or Jewish?  My point exactly if you have then it was a rare occasion.

State Law varies....... . A burglar is someone who enters a residence or building without the permission of the owner. You don't necessarily have to make it out of the door with any bounty to be charged with burglary. (culpability). . Theft is when someone steals your lawnmower out of your back yard,  you gnome out of your garden, ect.. . If you invite someone over to your house and they steal your money out of your purse, that is theft.. . *the difference between a thief and a burglar depends on their offense, both are stealing.

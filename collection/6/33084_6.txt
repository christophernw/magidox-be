Well if you continue to do nothing it will take care of itself and you.  The clot can break loose and lodge in your lung (pulmonary emboli), in your heart (heart attack) or in your brain (stroke).  It can also lodge in any of your other organs or eyes.  You cannot make it go away on your own without medical help.  You need blood thinners that will prevent it from growing further and meds that will help to dissolve it.  No insurance or not... is it worth dying over?  That is the chance you are taking.

President Bush has referred to a new world order on more than one occasion - where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind: peace and security,freedom and the rule of law.. However,mankind has had centuries to establish a world of peace and security.Doubtless, many have been very sincere in their endeavours.Regardless of the structure of governments conceived by men to fulfill such objectives,however,the Bible's words have proved true:"It does not belong to man who is walking to direct his step"-Jer.10:23.. gordo burns is correct because the same inspired Word of God provides assurance that there will be a new world.After foretelling the end of an  old system of things,the apostle Peter declared-"there are new heavens and new earth that we are awaiting,according to His promise,and in these righteousness is to dwell."2Peter3:10-13.. Our Heavenly Father will be ushering in a new world order in which righteous people will be able to live together in peace and unity.There will be no more wars,sicknesses,death,pain,suffering -Rev.21:4.. The wicked will have been done away with and those righteous ones that remain will have the opportunity of everlasting life

Very good question and I'll just stick to American history for my answer.  Actually i think that there were four battles that deserve equal importance..      1. Antietam <AKA Sharpsburg>  Sept 1862.. Allowed Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation and ended all hope of European help to the Confederacy..     .      2. Gettysburg and Vicksburg...July 1863...Ended all hope of a military victory being acheived by the Confederacy.  Never again would the Confederacy be able to field such large Armies in the field..      .      3. Battles around Atlanta...Summer of 1864... Ended in a Cofederacte loss of Atlanta and ended all hope of Union war weariness forcing a negotiated peace and ensured Lincoln's re-election.. .      Each of these battles settled once and for all a specific reason that the Confederates could hope for a victory.  No other war with another nation could have changed America more than a seperate Confederacy.

The US does use the Metric System, we have liter bottles of soda, liters of water.  Many tools are in metric.  Many manufacturing processes are measured in metric.  Almost all scientific studies and work is done in Metric. Most of our cars show both KPH and MPH on the speedometer. . . But you're correct, it is not the standard of the USA.  But probably should be.  Switching would be difficult, but would benefit the USA greatly.  It's an easier system to learn, and it's an international standard.

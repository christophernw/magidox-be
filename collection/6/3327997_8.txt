Go back to school and get certified. You won't need to take any other classes other than those in the field of education to do elementary ed. If you go secondary ed., you may need to find a subject area which may recquire aditional schooling. The first thing I would do is check with the school's eduaction dept. and talk to a counselor.  Good Luck!

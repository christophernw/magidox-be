If you are speaking about actual philosophical terms, then it is a realist, although there are a few branches of realism.  There is representative realism, the view that we cannot directly experience the world, so all we see is actual representations of things, it allows for personal differences in perceptions.  The second branch of realism is naive realism, which is basically what you see is what you get, a table is a table, if you watch a film there is no further analysis needed.  There is another branch of philosophy to do with perception which is phenomenalism, if you are familiar with idealism it attempts to solve the problems of idealism, whereas instead of completely eradicating the physical world, it says that there is a permanent possibilty of somethings existence once it is experienced.

go to your doctor and get some anti biotics quick. i had a nasty bladder infection, i dont know if sex caused it but it usually become more painful after sex. it got to the point where i had 103 fever and my body would not stop shaking for an entire day. the pain gets unbearable too. go to your doctor asap i dont think it will go away on its own.

Because they are loonier than a hill of beans...which they will eat at a drop of a pin...don't stand down wind from vegatarians..can be unpleasant at times. And if you really want to have fun with them, grab a big old hunk of US Prime T-bone and fry it up, eat it when you serve them that hill of beans...always good for diner conversation. But, be prepared for a real run at trial conversion...sort of like the Christian thing, only plugging carrots, not Christ. Vegans are malnourished, are easy prey to meat jokes, and, in all, can be very entertaining. ... the life of the garden, so to speak.

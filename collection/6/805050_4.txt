first you need somewhere to park.  if you dont have anywhere to park then they wouldnt get any business.  sometimes bars in a strip mall type location and the parking there is for all businesses not just one and getting rid of that will decrease business in all the businesses.  plus not everyone that goes to a bar plans on drinking, even some people go to a bar to have a few beers which is ok too, but its not ok to drink yourself silly then drive, one day they will pay for it either by accident or by police.

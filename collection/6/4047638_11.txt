I am religious. Sometimes I feel sorry for atheists as they must feel lonely at times. Other than that, they are much better than those religious fanatics who don't mind killing in the name of God.. . Second point, I have recently been to a devil's abode... I mean they pray to God every single day but all their creativity is directed towards making other's lives miserable. They lie, cheat, steal... in fact they are all the sins personified. What's more, when it suits them, they make fun of God-fearing people and at other occassions they flaunt their religious ways. They even misguide others about religious rituals and put them in harm's way.. . My mom was never a staunch believer but some events strengthened her faith. My father, on the other hand, is an atheist. Still I prefer people like them who may be atheists, may not flaunt their faith but are scared of doing something wrong. God! Please grant that we always follow your ways.

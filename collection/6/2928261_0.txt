Fibromyalgia (pronounced "fie-bro-my-al-jia") is not a disease but a collection of symptoms (referred to as a syndrome) characterized by widespread musculoskeletal aches and pains, stiffness, fatigue and muscle spasms. The exact etiology of FS has not been identified although a myriad of mechanisms have been proposed, including inability to acquire appropriate sleep, micro-circulation disturbances, hormonal changes and others.

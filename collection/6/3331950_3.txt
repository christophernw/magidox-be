Our trainer told us that as the dominant pack member, we are to decide when it is time to play and when it's time to be done.  As the dominant in the home, your dog needs to learn to respect this.. . So when your done, pick a key word, like enough, to say and then be done playing.  When your dog attempts to lure you in again, say enough.  It should also be you that initiates play time, again with a key word or phrase, like "let's play".  . . If your dog is still wanting to play, and your arm has had enuf, maybe consider working on some basic obedience training at this time.  It will be physically easy on you, and still give your dog a focus and you'll be teaching your dog too!

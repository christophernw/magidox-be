Okay, Hoover did have a passive stance when it came to handling the depression... but really, he just handled it poorly. Hoover used the federal budget to give aid to those in need, FDR, on the other hand, created jobs. (I'm not religious, but the proverb is true: give a man a fish hge can eat for the day, teach him how to fish and he can eat forever...) FDR created public works, which employed people and those people in turn spent the money they earned on goods and services. Yes, WWII helped get us out of the Depression, wars stimulate economies, but anyone who says it wasn't FDR who brought us out of the Depression is plain wrong (beyond the fact that he led us into WWII and was the guiding force behind our victory)... Hope that helps... This is the Smart Guy, and you can Trust ME...

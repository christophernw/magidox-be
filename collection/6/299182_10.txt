Get a humane trap (live trap) and put something really smelly in there-- tuna works great.  Set the trap in an area where the cats are known to travel.  You might want to disguise it with bracnes, a blanket, etc.  Now, some cats might be wise to traps so you'll have to use something nearly irresistible as bait.  The way the traps work is this... there's a door on one end that you prop open.  You place the bait at the opposite end.  In the middle of the trap is a trip pad that makes the gate snap shut when the cat steps on it.  The cat will HAVE to step on it at some point, and CLANG!  He's caught.  At that point, it's just like being in a carrier.  Be sure, however, to check the trap frequently several times a day and include some water in a "rabbit bottle" or spill-proof dish as part of the bait.  Once you have a customer, take him to a shelter or the pound.. . You can also use Pine-sol (diluted-- for smell only) or citrus like lemon in the areas where the cats hang out.  They hate those smells!

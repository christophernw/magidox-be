Catholic (the word means universal) Church : Holds that you or I cannot approach God personaly, we must go through a priest. Mankind cannot approach Jesus, the mediator (according to Roman Catholicism) except through Mary.. They expect to see many thrones, one with God one with Jesus and a multitude with various saints.. This is very far from the First Commandment, worship God and Him only. Most of the RCC ceremonies come from the pagan people that were conquered by the Jesuits and other missionary armies of the Pope. The accepted Baptism is for confirmation of membership in the RCC and is done by sprinkling.. . The Christian Church: Broke away from the restrictive government of the RCC mainly in that the RCC restricted the people from reading the Bible. The reformists established other 'churches' and began printing Bibles. BUT most of the practices of the RCC and the form of church government was used to build these Christian sects (ie, Trinity [3 gods], and sprinkling, priests, ceremonies, etc.). . The Baptists: Differ only in the form of Baptism (fully submerged) and who can be baptised (no children).. . The True church of the Apostles, from 33A.D. to 300A.D., worshipped One God, who came in flesh to the earth, lived as we live, suffered and joyed as we suffer and have joy, that He would know what we go through, He understands. They baptised full immersion to those who understood that a relationship with God is uppermost in their lives.. Today, this church is called Apostolic Pentecostal, and is the fastest growing church in America because people want to know the truth.

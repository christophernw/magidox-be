In my area we have Toys for Tots and Angel Trees.  They will provide infant through teen gifts. The Fire and Police Departments are who you contact here. You might try that. Also, try shopping clearance and discount. There are many online stores with clearance (circuit city, Toys R Us, wal-mart, collections ETC). You could also make things. The main thing is to provide them with love. Good Luck & Merry Christmas!!!

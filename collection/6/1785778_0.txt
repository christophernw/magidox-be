The body when alseep turns off the bit of the brain that tells it to move.  However every now and then it flickers back into life and you move as you are in your dream.  Its very natural and if you watch dogs sleep they chase things and sometimes even bark.  Very odd, but the brain has to stop you acting out your dreams, otherwise youd be knackered.

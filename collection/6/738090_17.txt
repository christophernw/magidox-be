First, you have to certain that you are who you think you are.  Having an older sibling make such a claim could have implanted in your subconscious.  You are 16, take time to be certain, you are talking about something that will affect you and others around you for the rest of your life. . . Second, when you are certain that of the person that you are, find strength in that.  Unless you are strong your mind will be easily swayed and your mother may find herself well justified in sending you to therapy.. . Do not let what this guy or pastor may think of you rush your thought process, No one should dictate your life except yourself.. . You have to find strength in yourself, no matter what you are, and no matter what the decision.  But your brother has gone through this, don't be scared to seek his help.. . I think that since I have given you my advice it is only fair that you should know where I stand so that you could really evaluated my response.  I am not gay, nor do I approve of the gay lifestyle, but I do accept people for who they are, and understand we all walk a different path.

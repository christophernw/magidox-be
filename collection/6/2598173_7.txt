um yea ! american citizens won't be turned down for jobs because they can't speak SPANISH ! hell maybe all the products i purchase will stop printing stuff inspanish because some dumb ass gave their child tylenol and it killed them because they didn't know how to read english. lawsuits like that will stop because they have no precedence. I like my hair smooth and sleek not liso y sedoso, okay ?

Note that the ham, Christmas & Easter been here way before the Messiah so when the apostle said that people would preach of a different Messaih could this be the one? Why do we have these things to remember the Messiah when he gave us his own memorial the day before the Passover,Luke 22:19 this is the evening meal that he had with his diciples.

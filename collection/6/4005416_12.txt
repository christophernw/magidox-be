Salt is added ato butter to keep it from spoiling as fast.  Each manufacturer of butter adds different amounts.  Usually the amount is not enough to make much of a difference...especially if it is a spiced cookie.   I have never had a problem using salted butter instead on unsalted in any recipe except for bread as salt inhibits the growth of yeast.

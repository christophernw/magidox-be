I heard a story from a society that had no writing system.  A rich man had 6 sheep which he ask a young man to take up the mountain for the summer.  How could the rich man and the young man both know if the young man brought back the right number of sheep? (Not counting new-born lambs - they are a bonus).  Before he left, both the rich man and the young man made notches on sticks, one notch for each sheep.  At the end of the summer, the young man brings back his stick, with the sheep to match.  An early example of a balance sheet.

The only state that has legalized it is Massachusetts. . Most people believe it is wrong because of -personal- beliefs that only pertain to them and other that subscribe to similar belief system.. . there is ultimately no candid argument against same-sex marriage which makes the fact people are attempting to ban it illegal, immoral, and unconstitutional.. . . ----------------. Teagen is an example of such people. . . the incest argument has long been fallacious. people who believe gay marriage would legalize incest haven't pursued the subject much then at face value. . . If the parents of a child were to marry someone for sexual purposes why wouldn't they just do it regardless of marriage?. . the argument doesn't stand. . . Furthermore traditional is in terms of ethics. in society ethics are a belief system. what you believe may not be what i may believe. In just attempting to force those traditional value on others is unconstitutional. its what our country was built on. the basic concept of freedom of expression. . . People like this are only attempting to abate the merit of the constitution and the values from which it was created.

Dear Theresno,. . If you thought the Christian (above) was rude, I apologize to you on his behalf. If he thought you were rude to him, I would encourage him to not let his chagrin keep him from sharing Christ with others.. . I am a Christian, and I invite you to come into relationship with the God of the Universe (based on what Jesus Christ did for you and for me on the cross). For a brief explanation of how to come into relationship with the God of the Universe, see http://www.godsci.org/gs/new/essence.html. . I have nothing to gain by your accepting or rejecting my invitation. I invite you to come to Christ, purely out of obedience to Jesus Christ (and I would also like to see you in heaven one day).... . I used to be an atheist. Over a period of time however, I grew convinced of the existence of the Christian God, and ultimately committed my life to Christ. For a draft-version of my journey from atheism to Christ, see http://www.godsci.org/gs/chri/testimony/seek.html. . Cordially,. John

An important feature of cell lines is that they have to come from a source that will continue to divide.  If you take most adult cells and culture them, they will only divide a few times and then stop.  Most often, cell lines that can propigate for years come from tumors (since they divide uncontrollably), embryonic cells (since they have great potential to divide), or from adult cells that are transformed with oncogenic virus.

Smart or knowledgeable?  There is a difference you know.  Smart is simply put as things coming together quickly to make sense.  Knowledge is reading up on things to make you more up to date-kind of like having to download something into your computer to make it work better.    Most people are knowledgeable.  They have to read up to get the right idea first.   And there's nothing wrong with that.  But there are those that can piece things together all on their own and quickly.  Perhaps it's a gift to be smart.  But it isn't shameful to be knowledgeable either.  Both work well-especially together.

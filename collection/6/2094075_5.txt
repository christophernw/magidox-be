I would assume that it's from laziness.  We (people who speak english) are lazier and lazier in speaking, grammar or writing skills.  It seems that almost every word has been broken down to make it easier to speak (example Ain't or even more so can't which is really cannot).  Yo' I believe is from the word "You" and the last letter was dropped.

Costco is one of the highest paying companies in the "retail" market.  According to Time magazine, the AVERAGE income of a person working in a Costco store is US $17/hour.  Many of my friends have worked there (at Canadian locations) and enjoyed it, although most started out as temporary seasonal employees and were only kept on as regular employees if they worked harder than they socialized!

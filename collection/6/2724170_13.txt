Your dog is most likely barking at nothing. Dogs can hear at a higher and lower frequency than humans can so when it hears a weird noise your dog will start to bark to tell you he/she heard something weird. It may seem like he/she is barking at nothing because you may not have heard it due to the frequency may be out of human's range.

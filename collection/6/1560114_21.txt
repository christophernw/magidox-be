I'm a smoker too.  I ask myself this question over and over as well.  Why should you quit smoking?  I could answer the same as everyone else for all the health benefits etc. yadda yadda yadda but let's face it...you only live once and that really doesn't deter anyone from giving up a vice.  Look how many people drink alcohol?  Certainly not for their health or the safety of others!  I would love to hear as much preaching against drinking as there is for smoking lately...sheesh.  But anyway..back to the question.... . I don't sleep around, I don't drink, I don't do drugs...smoking is my only vice!  So the only reason I can offer is the same reason that I am going to use to quit smoking..... . It costs toooooo darn much!  When I think of all the shoesssssss I could buy with that money, or the clothes, or really cool craft thingamabobs I could afford if I didn't smoke...dang...and here I'm wasting all my money on ciggarettes that I don't really like the taste of and I never get that cool headrush from anymore.  That is reason enough for me!. . When you do decide to quit...try the 7 day Smoke Away program.  It worked for me and my mom a few years ago quite easily and with little withdrawal symptoms.  It made quitting easy.  Thats the one I'm going to use again.  I had quit for 5 months, her for 8, but then I started smoking again cause...silly me...thought that I could control it and only smoke one occassionally....fatal mistake  LOL.  . . Good luck with quitting!!!

A novel that puts forth a hypothesis about the Holy Grail and a secret society of men (including Da Vinci who is said to have left clues in his art) who have guarded it's location/identity.  It's not meant to be taken literally but it's a good read if you like thrillers and aren't likely to be offended by a twist on a basic tenet of Christianity.

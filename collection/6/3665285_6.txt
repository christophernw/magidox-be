It's because of poverty, simply it. "Freedom", "government repression"... bullshit, Mexico is a democracy. But people above are too ignorant to know what is going on in another countries. I see some people complaining that they have to be bilingual, as if it such a terrible thing. Look, here in Brazil if you want a good job you must know english, and I have lived all my life in Brazil, how unfair! oh!

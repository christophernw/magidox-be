The arguement that I learned in one of my classes was that it was bad to eat meat because in order to raise an animal for humans to eat we must feed the animal and that is food which we could be eating ourselves.  In terms of calories, it takes x calories to feed a cow, and then y calories to feed a human so x+y=#calories for a meateater where x calories could go for a vegitarian.. . Don't forget also that cows burping causes gasses to be released which harm the ozone layer and so if we had less cows we'd have less cow gas and more ozone.

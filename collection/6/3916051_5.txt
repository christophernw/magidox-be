A hurricane is a tropical cyclone, originating over tropical or subtropical waters with a closed surface wind circulation about a well-defined center(eye). Also, a hurricane is formed without a front (where warm air and cold air meet), whereas a regular storm is usually formed at a front and doesn't have an eye.

Well look, just because I person decides to have sex with a person of the same gender doesnt mean they need to be killed.  although I dont agree with being gay, I see that everyone has a right to live, and a right to be how they want to be.  I may not like kissing a man or anything like that, but gays are still people.  Who has a right to take away a god given right?  Just like you have a right to live, why shouldnt they?  I mean they probably oppose you watching porno movies, and downloading kiddy porn but they dont come out and call for your execution...

Unfortunatly, theres not a whole lot that you can do from keeping them from divorce. My dad did the same thing to my mother when I was young, and they ended up in divorce. The one thing to rememeber, and my parents made sure I knew this, was that none of it was my fault. And it is important for you to know that too. Good Luck

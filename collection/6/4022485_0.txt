" A humble person is generally thought to be unpretentious and modest: someone who does not think that he or she is better or more important than others...In essence, humility is obviously not thinking highly of yourself nor is it thinking lowly of yourself. For both of these are pride. Humility is simply not thinking of yourself at all." <1>. . People need to humble themselves to remove pride, envy, gluttony, slothiness, vanity, greed, lust, avarice, and wrath. For example, when people are overly "Prideful" is when they invoke envy on the people around them.  Say a person buys a Ferrari and is boastful to his neighborhood that they have this Ferrari.  This will lead to the people around them to try and get <earn, steel, or damage> what they have <envy>.  Should they accomplish this then the owner of the Ferrari may lash back to get revenge <wrath>.  If however, the Ferrari owner was not prideful and shared their Ferrari with the neighbors, then this whole dramatic show would have been avoided.

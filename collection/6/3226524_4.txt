Someone told me, in the olden days they would burn people for being witches.  One of the signs of being a witch was sneezing 3 times consecutively. That is because they believe the heart stops when someone sneezes.  To save someone from being burned as a witch you would God bless them. Terrible choice, die from the sneeze, or die burning. Serious they were to God Bless.

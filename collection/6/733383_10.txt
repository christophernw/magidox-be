Most of the Christiansns who know the Bible well, know that each and every person is a gift of God. Created by God in his image and likeness. One should accept people from other religions irrespecivet of them being muslims/hindus, as your brother and sister. But sometimes there are people may be Christians/hindus and muslims who are themselves very restless and disturbed due to personal reasons and thus they get angry with themselves as well as with the people around them. . God says that we cannot say that we love him (when we have not seen him) if we hate the person who we can see.. . I am a Christian myself and I am proud to be one. But I donot discriminate poeple from other religions. I have a lot of muslim friends and I love them all.

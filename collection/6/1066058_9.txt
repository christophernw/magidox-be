"If you're going through Hell, keep going." - Winston Churchill.. . I think we let ourselves get bogged down in the bad stuff so much sometimes that we refuse to see that we can wait it out, or even be proactive towards ending whatever it is that is troubling us.  It's very important to try to keep your wits about you, even if everything seems bad at the moment.

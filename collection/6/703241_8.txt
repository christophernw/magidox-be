Someone who lives in the US, the freest and most prosperous nation in the world and is broke and poor and then expects things that they do not earn.  You have people like me who earn a living by earning it and working hard and smart.  Then you have the losers who want to seize it via taxes and give it to those who have not earned it.   They do so in the doctrine of fairness.  Yet ask them if they will give their money and they hem and haw.  . . Anyone who lives in the US and is poor and complains without doing anything about it qualifies.

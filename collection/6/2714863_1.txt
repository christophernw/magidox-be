If you don't get it rinsed off quickly before it dries, the paint will be damaged to the extent that it needs to be repainted.  Once it dries, the damage is done.  . . As eggs dry out they start to rot and generate sulphur dioxide.  When mixed with water, this forms sulphuric acid.  This etches the paint permanently.  It needs to be taken down to the bare metal, primed, and repainted.. . If someone did this as a "prank", they owe you for the damage to your car.  File in small claims court for reimbursement if they refuse to pay.  File a police report and press charges.  That will wake them up QUICKLY!. . This isn't a joke or prank, it's criminal damage.  These are NOT friends.  As the old saying goes, "With friends like that, who needs enemies?". . I can't overstress the importance of getting the damage repaired quickly.  If the damaged paint isn't removed down to the bare metal and repainted, the sulphuric acid will continue to eat through the paint and eventually attack the metal, causing it to rust through.  This happened to my Dad's car back in the 1960s and about a year after the egging, we had holes appearing all over the car.  It was so bad he had to buy a new car.

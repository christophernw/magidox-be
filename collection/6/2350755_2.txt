Its all to do with string theory and all the calculations seem to work only with 11 dimensions. Its a tricky concept. We know the 4 dimensions, they are the three spacial dimensions (x , y, z) and the one dimension of time ( t ). The others we cannot see and is imposible for us to even visulise properly, but are throught of as dimensions which are wraped around one another and curled up. A really good program explaines all this in some detail. Check out "The Elegant Universe" on the Nova Science website.

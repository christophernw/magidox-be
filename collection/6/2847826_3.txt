it means he wasn't introduced to them at a proper time (birth-5mo) or was abused. do stop this behavior make  those stuff=good. have someone work wih you on this. have somebody hold the leash(w/ ur dog on it) as soon as u take out the mop, broom, or vacuum, have ur friend distract ur dog by making it perform tricks and feeding special treats. repeat this until ur dog is comfortable w/ u just taking it out. maybe try giving a command like calm once it gets the idea. then do this while u actually use the mop, broom, and vacuum. give the command as soon as she shuts up(stiull need a friend for this). *dont move on until ur dog is completely comfortable

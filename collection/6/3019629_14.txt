I know nicotine is not more addictive than heroin, maybe  just snorting coke, not heroin. Just more government propaganda that the masses willingly follow like lost sheep. And illegal is just a sick bird anyway. Why aren't they unlawful? Money mostly the buzz is not that good the only way it really affects someones judgment is to make them smoke more. You really don't hear about to many crimes being spurred from nicotine addiction.

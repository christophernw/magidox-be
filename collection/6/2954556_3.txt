In boiler, the coal is heated.  The coal heats water passing through the boiler, creating high-temperature, high pressure steam.. In a turbine, the high-temperature, high pressure steam is further compressed by the turbine nozzle, turning the turbine rotor.  The turbine rotor shaft speed is limited to a specific RPM by a valve upstream of the turbine.  The turbine shaft has magnets connected to it, which create an electric field, generating 3-phase AC.. The steam leaves the turbine, goes through a condenser (using cooling water), the condensate (water) leaves the condenser.. A pump adds energy to the water, moving it back to the boiler.

Before Christ came and died on the cross to atone for our disobedience, God brought judgment upon his people, as you have stated.   But Christ is the new covenant... meaning judgment will happen on Judgment Day and not before.  . . Thankfully, Christians have the security of knowing their disobedience is covered by the cross.

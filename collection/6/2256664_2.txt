If you're asking about travel arrangements - a one-way trip gets you from location A to location B. A roundtrip gets you from locationn A to location B and back again. If you are taking a trip from location A to B to C and back again to location A that is refered to by travel agents as an "open jaw" trip or travel. I have no idea where the expression came from.

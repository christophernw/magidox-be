Nobody can answer that question because nobody really knows. If somebody tries to give you an answer, that person has to be giving you an opinion, or someone else's opinion. Personally, I hope to find that answer after I die. But for now, I have many other more important things to ponder....like what I can do to make this life better for me, my family, and my country.

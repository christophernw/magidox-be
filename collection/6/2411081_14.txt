Forgiven: . . It is unfortunate to see that you have been visiting anti-mormon web pages.. . The quote that you have provided is quite out of context. The plates were about the size mentioned as stated in Articles of Faith. Yet your misleading premise leads people to believe that they actually weighed 230 lbs., rather than state that if they had they been made of pure Gold, they would have weighed over 200 lbs.. . However, the plates were described to have the appearance of Gold and most likely were not pure gold as gold is quite malleable. Furthermore, it was not a solid block of gold. They were metalic sheets, like pages, and therefore, cannot be compared to the mass of pure solid gold block of the same size. Most scholars think that the metal was Tumbaga, which is a common gold alloy used in Mesoamerica. Those who hefted the plates gave 50lbs as the approximate weight, which makes more sense. . . Perhaps you should concern yourself more with Exodus 20:16: Thou shalt not bear false witness. When you intentially mislead people, you are bearing false witness. Did you even look up the quote in Articles of Faith to make sure it was accurate?. . Mathew 7:1-3 states: Judge not that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. I really don't think that you have the right or enough information to make any judgement of Joseph Smith's character.. . If you have any real questions, feel free to contact me.

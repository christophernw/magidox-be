A lifeguard is a great one. You have to get certified, but your employer will normally pay for that if they decide to hire you. It's really easy. Just a couple of tests. It's one of the easiest jobs too because people don't typically need that much help when they swim. You normally just end up playing pool games with the kids. Another plus, you get a GREAT tan!!

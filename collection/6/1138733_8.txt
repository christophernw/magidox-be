Get on a healthy meal plan, and start exercising regulary. Only eat 3 meals a day with several small snacks, dont sit around the house and snack all day, when you want the snickers got for a nutragrain bar instead!! :) Cut down the Coke and stuff, even though its "diet" there have been tests run people stop drinking cokes and carbonated drinks and loose anywhere from 3-7bls in a week. And if Starbucks is part of yoour everyday diet.. SCRATCH THAT :)

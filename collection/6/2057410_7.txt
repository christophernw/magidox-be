u see, when u start cooling water, u get to a temp of 0 celcius. . then water starts getting converted to ice, but the temp remains at 0 . . after all the water has been connverted to ice, the temp falls furthur. . but ice is always "cooler" than water becoz when ice melts it takes "latent heat" from the surroundings ( our hand) and thus it feels colder

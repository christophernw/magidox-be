Hi Matty,. Approach them with respect because they are real people created in God's image. With humility, because we too are learners and do not have all the answers. With faith, because it is contageous. With love, because God is working his love through you. With prayer, because you need more than your own smarts. With persistence, because you will be rejected many times and your responsibility is to remain obedient to the Father. May God bless your efforts.

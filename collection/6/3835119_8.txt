Whenever you are between arousal and non you tend to itch.  Its not that its "itchy" it just feels good to massage in a different way.  The penis also gets a lot of buildup in your pants.  Make sure he isn't wearing too tight underwear and I would probably switch to boxers if not boxer briefs.. . Also applying cream is very important.  Keep it moisturized because it might start to flake skin off which will make sex painful.

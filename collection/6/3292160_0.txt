Mostly hereditary reasons. I too had the same situation, and found it out only when I was trying to conceive and my periods were irregular. I had got off the pill at that time, so thought it was the after effect of all those contraceptives, not realizing that actually it was PCOS or PCOD. . . If you're trying to have a baby, visit your gynaec. He/she may suggest medication to overcome PCOS and become pregnant. It worked for me. My baby is 3 years old now.. . Good luck and don't let this affect you mentally. Lots of women have it. It's just that they don't discuss it.

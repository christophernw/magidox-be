This is because the people who run your school are conservative fascists who are mean and like to control you. They want you to conform to rules that are stupid and meaningless. They are old boring people and they think they have a good reason for not letting you wear a hat but the real reason is because they want to control you. It is a rule that they use to make you do what they want. But we also do not wear hats inside as a way of being polite. It is very polite to remove your hat when you go inside a person's houes and rude to wear one at the dinner table. If you want to be polite then you should not wear ahat inside.

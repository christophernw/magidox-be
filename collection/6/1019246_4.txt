Actually, most trials allow video taping by the press UNLESS there is motion made by either sides in the case to prohibit video taping or the judge decides that no cameras are going to be allowed. The reason you don't see many videos of famous cases is because the lawyers made a motion and the judge ruled in their favor, or the judge decided him/herself not to allow it. The Constitution says that each person is gauranteed a public trial; no ifs, ands or buts, you just have to go in person.

Are you sure you mean geologist? If so, then probably the layers of rock. There needs to be a drastic change in format. Once geologists spot that, a new change happened. They name the era/period after the format of the rock or something that likely happened during that period by looking at the format of the rock.. If you mean HISTORIAN, then they divide Earth's existance into eras and periods by seeing drastic changes in human behavior or technology and stuff.

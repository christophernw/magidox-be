Get yor're crankshaft precision balenced (or buy one that already is), use lighter oil, better bearings (all of them), better cooling, "shorter" piston heads (racing heads), better rings, more durrable vavle springs, precision cam... if you want more power on the top end, you could add a turbo (fairly easy to do), but that's pricey, but then again, most of the other things I mentioned are... but since it's only doing 5K, it probably is due for a rebuild.

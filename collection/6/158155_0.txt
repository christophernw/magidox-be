Typical blown head gasket sign is white exhaust, because water leaks past the gasket.  Have you visually examined around the cylinder head for signs of leaks?  You could also do a compression check on the cylinders, to see if you are getting any leaks.  Also, you can do a pressure check on the cooling system to see if there are any leaks from the head.. . I have had cars overheat.  As long as you catch it before a few minutes have gone by, there is usually no major damage.

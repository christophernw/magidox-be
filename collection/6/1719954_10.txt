I think you should talk about it to your superiors. Also those evaluations might be a code? For example in germany "great teamwork" might actually mean "she chatted all the time with her colleagues instead of doing any work", and "good" is only average. You have a right to get a good reference in Germany, perhaps it is the same in the US.

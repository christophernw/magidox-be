Go to the pet store and get a grooming brush that is called a "rake" what that brush does is  brush out the under coat which is what your dog is shedding. Brush the dog with that everyday outside and it ends the shedding process faster. You could also take the dog to a pet groomer and get it's hair  shaved depending on what type of dog.

There could be several reasons.  Not being familiar with you situation I'll just throw some things out there.. . Perhaps you weren't invited because..... ..the invitation got lost in the mail. ..you've turned them down before, so they made the assumption that you wouldn't come anyway, so no more inviations. ..they forgot your name/address and are too embarrassed to ask you for it again. ..you did something that rubbed the inviter the wrong way, and you ticked them off. . Who know's?  But what ever you do, don't let it get you down!  I have a mother in law who likes to invite the whole rest of the family to stuff and leave out our branch of the family.  I just think, "well, sucks to be them...they're missing out on all of our charm ;)"

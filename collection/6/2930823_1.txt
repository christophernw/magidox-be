You should listen to other people first before you make a remark.  Think about what you are saying and would you like the comment told to yourself.  Say polite comments if you disagree like "I'm not interested, but thank you."  "Maybe next time."  "I wish I could, but I must catch my flight."  Remeber to smile!!!!  It's hard to get angry with someone when they are smiling.  Also, being sarcastic really turns alot of people off automatically..even if the intention was to be funny.  Lean in to people when they are talking, make eye contact so you appear interested and smile.. even if you don't want to.

Well I have a Rottweiler and she is great! (NOT) She has a bad attitude. I mean she is good with the family but as soon as anyone comes over she tends to get mean. I don't know why she was never trained to be mean. But don't get me wrong I love my dog to death but if you were asking if you should get one don't. Unless you have time to train the dog.

Often you can tell someone is lying by simple facial expressions or movements, For example if someone looks to the bottom left, they are remembering, if they look to the bottom right they are creating something. If they fidget, cant look you in the eyes or touch their face or body at the moment of the statement, these are tells. Biting lip, nervous gestures, stumbling speech, etc.. are also possibilities.

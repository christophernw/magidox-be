I agree with you 100%...it bothers me to hear Jesus name in vane. It is wrong, but I suppose some people don't stop to think about it being blasphemy.. It seems that lots of things that are not Christian, are somehow accepted in this country, including using Jesus name in vane. We need to correct any of these behaviors, if we are to be respected as Christians...

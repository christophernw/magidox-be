First of all 'Devil' is the proper term, which is 'Satan' the Angel thrown out of Heaven for trying to take over the throne of God. Demons are Satan's followers, the only ones stupid enough to follow him, knowing that in the end  time Satan will loose the battle and bow down to Jesus and ask forgiveness and Jesus will say 'sorry but you are to late' and cast Satan and his followers into the pits of fire for eternity.

If your zebra has bald patches, there are really several possible sources of the trouble.. . 1.  He could be getting plucked by other birds in the cage.  I've seen this happen sometimes.. . 2.  He could be doing it himself - plucking or self mutilation does happen as well.. . 3.  You could be looking at a serious health problem such as a vitamin definincy as well.. . I would suggest a couple of things...  . . 1. watchful waiting, watch your cage.  Is it being picked on and bullied?  . . 2. If it is, you can remove either the offender or the victim.  (I would suggest the victim, often there is a problem that the others are aware of that you aren't.) . . 3.  look at the droppings from your bird.  Are they normal or are they too tight or too loose.  Good info to bring to your vet.. . 4.  Bring the bird in to a good avian vet.

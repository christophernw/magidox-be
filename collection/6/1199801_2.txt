I was taught a lot by someone Else's experiences, ie, never put your house in when borrowing money, find other collateral, or go elsewhere. . When borrowing money, always have a second source to allow for foreclosure, by  the first.. We all need to make our own mistakes, in order to make our own experience, . Experience the bad times, so when the good times come, you know they have arrived.. The power of accurate observation is called Cynicism !. There is no shortcut, but observation of others, helps.

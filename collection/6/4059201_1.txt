YES!  Been there done that and still do from time to time!  Get the counseling, get the medications to balance the chemicals that are out of order - and realize that you can't make them understand - not now and not ever - they simply have to choose to accept - they either will or they won't - but you have to take care of you mentally - and that's what is important!

The Jesus in the bible could be a composite of many people, he could have been a very well known preacher with a good following, he could have been a work of fiction. I guess that there were many men called Jesus at that time. . Some people have faith that the stories in the bible are true, some don't.. Personally, I don't believe there was one Jesus, son of god, saviour of mankind and so on.

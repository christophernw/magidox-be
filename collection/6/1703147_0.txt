The signals to sneeze come from a primitive part of the brain called the medulla oblongata in the brain stem.  A sneeze is a kind of bodywide reflex in which a lot of muscles contract, not just in the nose and throat but also those in the diaphragm, the abdomen, thighs, back, even sphincters.. Why people sneeze is not understood, and yes, some animals do sneeze as well.

call an army base, get an address to a unit overseas and write a letter to Single American Fighting Man, or something like that, enclose your letter, a self addressed envelope and a couple blank pieces of paper. or call a recruiter in your area they could probalby help you out. guys love getting mail, so i think you should be ok. good luck :)

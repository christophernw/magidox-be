Neutral is a position the transmission is in that does NOT allow engine power to be transmitted to the wheels.  Engine is running but wheels do not rotate.  Same as PARK, but without the brakes applied, vehicle will move freely...ie, roll away.. . Neutral is used usually when vehicle is being towed.  . . Now that I have probably confused you, have a good day.

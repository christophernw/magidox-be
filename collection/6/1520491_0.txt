The motion of Snake is So called the classical Physics. and the motion of the frog is quantum physics.. I mean, when you take the discrete values, then you are taking quantum leap.. Take another example, water from the closer look contains droplets while the river seems like a continous flow. So its up to u how closer do u go in to the understanding of the physical system.

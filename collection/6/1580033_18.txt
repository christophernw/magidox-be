It isn't just the xstians.  Everyone with a strong belief in something, especially something that is intertwined with their beliefs in life and who they are, will think they are right and everyone else is wrong.  To question their beliefs causes them uncertainty and hence fear and then, in reaction, anger.  Hence wars caused by religion.  Don't get phased by other people's support mechanisms infringing on you.  Just accept that's what they need to get by, politely ignore them and forgive them. ;)

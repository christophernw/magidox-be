i think the key might be in the slow cooking...... as far as the skin is concerned, i like to rub the potato in olive oil and cover with seasonings (anything you like, or just seasoned salt is okay) and then poke all over with a fork or icepick and wrap in tin foil.  i cook on 350 for a long time....checking every once in a while....but it does take 45-60 minutes.

huh, I do not recomend you learning painting from a book.. a blood and flesh teacher is definitely a better choice. Many, most of art teaching books are really horrible and you will not fall into trapp of making kitchy things. Besides a teacher can communicate with you, understand you, lead you, share his wisdom with you.

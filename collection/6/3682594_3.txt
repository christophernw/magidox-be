for most orchids that are grown in the wild, orchids look for a variety of light intensities, so in tropical trees, they will be found at various heights, each height representing a different light intensity.  Orchids actually require a fungus that can grow in knooks and crannies of a tree.  the orchids get a growing medium and water from the fungus and the orchids supply sugar to the fungus for it to grow on.

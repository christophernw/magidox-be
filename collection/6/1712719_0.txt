Valtrex is an antiviral medication that blocks the ability of the Herpes virus to reproduce.  Though it does not kill the virus, it can help it from spreading.  Since it only blocks the virus, once the medication is out of the system, the virus can once again reproduce and spread, therefore it must be taken on a daily basis for prevention to be effective.

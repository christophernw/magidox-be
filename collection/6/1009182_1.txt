You can always attempt to attach a read receipt to the e-mail.  If it's staying within the same email client, you'll probably get notification on when that person read your e-mail.  If it's going to a different e-mail client (i.e., Yahoo to Comcast)... you can probably have it tell you when it was delivered to that person's e-mail... but that'd be it.. . My guess anyways...good luck!

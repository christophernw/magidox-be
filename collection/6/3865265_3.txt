When you sing high notes, you should be in your falsetto voice which is in your head and wiggly.  When you are in your falsetto, sing softer.   Once you go lower, you'll be singing from your gut, and not your nose hopefully.  If you sing through your nose all the time, it's a hard habit to break, so get a good vocal coach to help you with that.

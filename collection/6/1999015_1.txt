Scrap prices are up high right now if you want to sell it to a crusher.  The catalytic converter will bring between $50 and $275 depending on size, aluminum wheels bring about $15 each, and by weight here cars bring $4 per hundred pounds which would bring about $100-150 depending on size of your car.  You can also take pics of it and sell it locally or on ebay and most likely get decent money out of it no matter what its condition.  Lots of people out there would buy junk before they would take a good car at the same price.

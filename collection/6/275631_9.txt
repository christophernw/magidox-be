Is this a joke?  . . Go take a class in economics.  Then think just a bit.  The entire world economy depends on petroleum.  We use it for fuel in transportation and power generation.  It's the raw material for making plastic, fertilizer, and explosives.  Hundreds of thousands of people, maybe millions, are directly employed in the drilling, extracting, refining, transportation, and selling of oil products.  . . How would you get to work without gas?  You couldn't drive your car, you couldn't take the train or bus.  Are you close enough to ride a bike to work?  Are you willing to do that 2 months from now?. . Without modern fertilizers, crop production would plummet.  But that wouldn't matter, because what was left would rot in the field because the farmers couldn't harvest it.

People get emotional over religion for the same reason they get emotional over politics and sports.. . None of these positions are generally arrived at through reason, so no reasonable defense is possible.  These are positions arrived at through emotion (aka faith), and can only be supported in that manner as a result.. . You can always tell when someone has no grounds to their position, because they will become angry or defensive if you question it, rather than explaining why they hold it.

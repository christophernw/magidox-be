White spots can be caused by sun but I've noticed in several people that they get them pretty bad by eating lots of salty things, Lemons, pickles, twang.....Eating these things or salty items on a regular basis (everyday) can be the cause. Once you stop they kind of fade away and disappear..but if you aren't eating those things then yes you should see a doc. as soon as you can.

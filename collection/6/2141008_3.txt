Yeah, right, use The Bible for your convenience and interpret it as you want... well, there are also poison plants, Would you make brownies out of them? God also gave us reason, logic and intelligence and free will, if you want to have marijuana brownies there's nothing we can do but don't come and say "The Bible says this or that" because you want to justify the illegal use of drugs.

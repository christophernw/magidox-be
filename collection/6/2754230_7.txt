***First of all limit lawsuits***. Excuse me, while there are a lot of lawsuits that get ridiculous sums, sometimes the amounts are completely justified. Say some doctor got drunk and left a scalpel inside you during a appendectomy that then cut you up so bad that you are in pain for the rest of your life. Or how about if your kid goes to the clinic for a tetanus shot and the nurse give him something else and he dies waiting for help. How do you put a price on those?. . I agree the system needs help, but the doctors, lawyers, lobbyists and hospitals are making all the money and the ones with the money are in charge. It is one of the flaws in capitalism.

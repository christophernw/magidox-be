Well, you simply have to read on and it says "You shall not bow down to them or serve them". Have you seen Christians bowing down to a cross and serving a cross? Or a crucifix (which has the statue of Christ on it) for that matter? But if you target is the Roman Catholics, then I will let them answer for themselves to you.

In the Washington state Governor election, Dino Rossi won by a slim margin, so the Dems sued. Here is the stink, They had 3 times the margin of victory in uncounted absent ballots,  the ballots were not signed. So they called the people and asked if they were Dem's or republicans, then if they were Dem's they asked if they would come and sign the ballots.  they stole the election.

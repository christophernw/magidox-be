I'd have to say it is a combination of what TomKat152 and Tim P stated and a little extra.  . . It was not our objective at that time.  We had a treaty with Kuwait and getting them out of there and protecting them was the main objective at the time.  We also had to consider the U.N., but I'll have to disagree with Tim P.  We didn't follow their rules to the letter.  We were pretty much the driving force then and everyone followed our lead, but we had to consider how other countries would react to what we did and they would not have reacted well if we went in at that time.  I'll agree it would have been easier to target Saddam at the time, but there are certain rules to war.  One rule is you don't target a nation's leadership in most cases. You have to have someone in charge to negotiate with. (Surrender, demands, etc.).  Also, you want the countryâ€™s leadership as stable as possible to minimize civilian casualties and suffering that comes about if a country is at war and looses it leadership. (Riots, thefts, starvation, etc).  Basically, if you take out the leadership it would wreak havoc.  It would be a lot worse than what is happening there now.  Yeah, I can hear you saying... Dang we should have done it and sometimes I feel that way myself, but the United States wants to keep things somewhat ethical.

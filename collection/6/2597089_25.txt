I think many Bibles that you find in churches are black due to tradition. You may also find church pew Bibles in navy blue.. However, I have a couple of different Bibles - a brown and black one, a white one, and a black one.. I bought a green and purple one with a flower on it last year as a gift for my teenage Sunday School helper.. If you are interested in a funky colored Bible, try your local Christian book store. Also, I believe the Family Christian Stores may have a website that you can order from.

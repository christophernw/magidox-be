The people I love keep me going. The desire to learn and see new things keeps me going. The sheer fact that each day is new and will bring new things and people into my life keeps me going. Doing good things for other people keeps me going..  . . But no. The sheer thought of God does not keep me going. Worshipping in a church most certainly does not keep me going.  Wouldn't your God, who apparently had a hand or two in creating this planet (according to legend), want you to go out and enjoy everything out there? Why does enjoying life all come back to believing in some words in a book? That is really all that is missing when you're an atheist - the book and the little group of people who meet once a week to review the book. (As an aside: not all atheist are bad. In fact, I've yet to meet a 'bad' one. They're people just like you. It's silly to think otherwise).

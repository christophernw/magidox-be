The most important thing you can do is always pay your bills on time. Set up automatic payment online if you have to, but always pay them.. . The second thing you can do it not have too much debt. If you have any credit card debt, you should pay it off. This is good financial management in any case, because credit card companies charge you way too much to lend you money.. . You can also get a copy of your credit report to check to see if it is accurate. If there are bogus entries on there that look bad, you should challange them. You can try challanging them even if they are correct, but usually creditors will document their claims.. . Over time, if you pay all your bills and don't run up too much debt, your credit will get better. I know, because I used to have terrible credit, but over time it has gotten much better. It takes seven years for bad entries to come off your record. I know this is a long time, but don't give up hope!

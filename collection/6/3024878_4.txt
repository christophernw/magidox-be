Eucalyptus, genus of trees and some shrubs of the myrtle family. This genus, which includes over 800 species, forms the preponderant vegetation and most valuable timber trees of western Australian forests. Eucalyptus trees are characterized by leathery, whitish leaves that hang vertically, their edges facing the sun, and their ragged bark and peculiar aroma. Some trees in the genus are among the tallest trees known. One specimen of mountain ash with a height of at least 97 m (at least 318 ft) was found near Melbourne, Australia.. . Many species are known as gum trees because of their resinous exudations. Among these are the blue gum and the cider gum, the lumber of which is widely used. Other species are known as stringybarks because of their fibrous inner bark. The peppermint trees, black peppermint and Sydney peppermint, are also included in this group. The ironbarks have hard gray bark and yield good timber. Botany Bay kino, a dark red, odorless gum employed as an astringent and a hemostatic drug and for tanning and dyeing, is derived from the ironbarks. The bloodwoods have reddish wood and also yield Botany Bay kino. Dragon's blood, tannin, oils, dyes, tars, and acids are yielded by other species of eucalyptus. . . Scientific classification: The genus Eucalyptus belongs to the family Myrtaceae. The mountain ash is classified as Eucalyptus regnans, the blue gum as Eucalyptus globulus, and the cider gum as Eucalyptus gunnii. Black peppermint is classified as Eucalyptus amygdalina and Sydney peppermint as Eucalyptus piperata.

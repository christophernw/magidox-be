A charismatic leader found a certain group of people he could blame all of the country's troubles on, basically scaring an entire nation's population into hating this group of people.  Anything this leader wanted to do, he could justify through the use of this fear.  His ego led him to believe that the entire world should follow his personal belief system and that he was divinely chosen to spread these beliefs through invasive war.

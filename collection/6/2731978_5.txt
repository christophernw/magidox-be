you really need eight hours a day of sleep. your body needs to go into deep sleep in order for you to feel truly rested. if you have bags under your eyes then you aren't achieving this deep sleep. this sounds crazy, but putting hemorrhoid creme, like preperation H, on the bags under your eyes before you go to sleep helps. don't get it in/on your actual eye, though. if you do this every night, you will notice a big difference.

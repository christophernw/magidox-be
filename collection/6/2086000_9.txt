it is like an area 51 site, just on water, and more mysterious. There are documents(undated) that state back to when Columbus was making the crossing into America, and he was forced into storms (supposedly in the bermuda triangle) by a strange flying object. Also, it could be a thing to do with gravity, I think. basically, there is a gravitational pull there, caused by the americas and the line of the equator pulling at each other, causing a pull near the middle and inner area. Yet another is that a huge mass of raw iron is under the ocean floor there, and so it causes all radios, compasses, and any other electric devices to go bad while over the whole area, which, of course would cause many types of air or water vehicles to simply stop working over the bermuda triangle

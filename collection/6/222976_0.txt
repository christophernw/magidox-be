It is a lobe-finned fish; the evolutionary relationships of the coelacanths to the other two living groups of lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii), the lungfish (Dipnoi), and the land vertebrates (Tetrapoda) remain debated until today. Since its discovery, many comparative morphologists and paleontologists considered the coelacanth to be the closest living relative of the land vertebrates, although the lungfish were historically thought, and continued to be thought by some researchers, to hold that claim. More recently, however, several analyses began to challenge the sistergroup relationship between the coelacanth and the tetrapods, first on morphological and paleontological grounds and later based on molecular phylogenetic analyses.

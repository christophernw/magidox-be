The condition you are describing is referred to as kwashiorker.. . In simple terms, the blood contains proteins whose sole function is to absorb water. The role of those proteins is to drag excess water out of the bodies tissues and back into the bloodstream for redistribution.. . If someone has a shortage of protein in their diet, or more usually a lack of some essential amino acids, the body can't make those water absorbing proteins. As a result when water leaks out of the bloodstream it stays there.. . That excess water in the tissues causes the tissues to become swollen. In most parts of the body the swelling is limited because the skin and tissues have limited capacity to expand. But the skin over the abdominal cavity, especially in children, is very expansible. When the fluid leaks into the abdominal cavity it keeps leaking, leading to a vastly distended gut. . . That is further aggravated by the inability of the blood to pull fluid out of the gut itself, resulting in bloating of the gut, and an inability of the body to produce digestive enzymes which results in bacterial overgrowth and gas buildup.

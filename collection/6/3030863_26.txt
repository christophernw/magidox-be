As a Brit who's lived in the US for the last 8 years I can assure you we're not jealous - we may feel a little sorry for you for your lack of history, ancient monuments, culture etc but that's ok, you can't help it. The only reason any European may hate you is because of the ignorant and rude attitude you have! Fortunately having lived here so long I know that it's only a minority that are like you, and I'm pleased to see so many other Americans taking the same view. As for "saving our butts" you actually sat on yours, TWICE, doing nothing while Europe was being destroyed, until US citizens got hurt, THEN you joined in! By that time, the greatest danger was already over, the Germans were already nearly beaten by the time you joined in the First War, and we Brits had stopped Hitler's plans for an invasion of England on our own before you joined the Second - if we hadn't done that how would you have helped us invade France? From where exactly? Just because you were late for the first 2 doesn't mean you have to start the next one!

Generally, the female lays eggs directly into the water.  This is usually done at same time as all other fish of the same species so overwhelming the egg preditors by shear volume of eggs available (more than they can eat in one go) so ensuring some eggs survive.  In other species individual females will lay eggs on stems of weed or on / under rocks.. . The males spray sperm into the water among the eggs so fertilising as many as possible, as quickly as possible.

It is a type of stew/soup. Instead of making it with broth, or tomatoes. Most people brown their meats Seafood (shrimp/crab) other seafood can be used. Chicken sausage. then make the rue. It is a gravy based soup. You burn the flour to make it dark and add flavor. (RUE). Gumbo file, garlic, onions, all types of seasonings. Making this a spicy tasty filling entree. New Orleans has the best. it is served over rice, or has rice in it also. Okra and tomatoes too. Someone served me tomato based gumbo before. I never saw such a thing and don't recommend that (what ever it was). It usually is a brown gravy color. Vegetables in it are usually okra and tomatoes. The rue is so thick you don't taste the slime on the okra. It is delicious. I am from the south.

There's NO such thing as to be rich easily and quickly. The real thing to become rich is, you work very hard and save all your earnings in your bank. Once you are promoted, you are rich....cos all your subordinates respect you and you do not need to pay for certain things! Therefore, you save your money...I tell you, when you retire, all the earnings you have saved, you count them all, YOU ARE RICH!!

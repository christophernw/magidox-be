i dont know anything else exept staying inside or putting n insect repelent spray.  but when i went to india  when those bumps came on my skin( which barelely happened cause i put the spray) i put hydrocortizone cream on the affected area. it is an anti--iflamatory agent. i know this cause my dad rreccomended this and hes a pharmacist.

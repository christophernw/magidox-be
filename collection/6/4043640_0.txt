make a new Friend.. you never know god probably didn't want a sweet and emotional person like you to be in a relationship which was in a way.. slightly one sided... nothing special and beautiful can come onto our lives without the old things making way for it... and when that special someone comes into your life.. who knows you may thank this person for going away and letting you find someone else.. but most importantly.. i would suggest you start enjoying your own company rather than anyone Else's as you can be alone but not lonely and no body is or should be made indispensable.. for you only you should be indispensable.. and once you realize that.. it won't be long before others do too.. so take care and best of luck!!

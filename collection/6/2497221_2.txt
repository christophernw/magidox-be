If you crush your chips up, then weigh out an equal amount of each (say 10 grams), put the crushed chips in some acid solution (say 100mls of 10% hydrochloric acid) and shake them up good, the iron should come out into solution.. . Then you could measure it using whatever you have access to.. AA, some kind of colorimeter...

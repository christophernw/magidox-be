I've been there honey. Lavender oils on your pillow works well - just a few drops. Before you go to sleep, take a few minutes without any TV or book and just be quiet. Take a facecloth and soak it in iced water put it just above your neck on the back of your head. Leave it there for a couple of minutes and repeat in your head "Cold and Heavy" when you're done snuggle into bed.

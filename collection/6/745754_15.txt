I went through Army basic.. . Saturday was no different from any other day.  You train.  You do PT.  You still work a long day just like any other.. . Sundays are pretty much your time.  All sorts of church services are offered, and if your religion is not there, then find one other trainee who is your religion and you two can meet with the chaplain solo.  Or, you can have your battle buddy go with you (always with the b.b., never ever be caught away from them).. Then, after church services, and even during (for those who didn't go), you clean.  Clean your room, clean the halls, the floors, shining the floors, your uniforms, your boots, you turn in and get new sheets, you take care of personal problems, write letters, listen to headphones (if your that far advanced and your drill allows it), work out, or do whatever your drill says.  Just hope he doesn't think you need some PT, or you'll be doing that instead.. . Good times.  Hey, if you wanna do it, definately do, it was an incredible experience, I wish I could go back.

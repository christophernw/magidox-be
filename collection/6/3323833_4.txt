It's fiction, and meant to be regarded as such.  For example, here are a few notes I took of the things wrong with the DaVinci Code, derived from a speech made by an Apologetic, Charlie Campbell:. .    Corruption of the Scriptures.             This is proven false because of-. 1.Manuscript (MS) evidence.   There survives some 24,000 partial and complete MSS of the NT, not to mention hundreds of OT MSS.  The Bible we have today is the same that the early Church had 2000 years ago.. 2. The Writings of Church Fathers (leaders of the Church in the first three centuries A.D., following the original disciples).  Even if we had no Biblical MSS today, scholars would be able to reproduce 98.86% of the NT, excluding only eleven verses.. . Isaiah 40:8, Mathew 24:35, 2 Peter 1. .  The origin of the Deity of Christ.            Dan Brown states that the Council of Nicea, in a close vote, established the deity of Christ.  In reality, however, the council was in modern day Turkey; a gathering of 318 church leaders from all over in 325 A.D. to discuss the doctrines related to the person of Jesus.  The knowledge that Jesus was the Son of God, and WAS God, was already firmly in place.  The real reason was a man named Arius, who was causing disputes on the Roman Empire as it related to the person of Jesus.  He denied the eternality of Jesus, and taught that He was a created being.  The council was called to condemn Arius’ teachings, and to reaffirm was the Bible said about what the CD said about Jesus having the same nature as God (Hebrews 1:3).  As for the close vote, of the 318 leaders that attended, only 5 disagreed with the previously established knowledge.  Of those 5, only 2 refused to sign the documents stating what was reaffirmed in the meeting, now known as the Nicean Creed.  Thus, this vote that Dan Brown calls a close vote is 316 to 2 (pg. 233 of “The DaVinci Code).  The fact the Jesus was God was already a prevailing fact.  He is called so in John 20:28 and Titus 2:13, among other places.  He Himself actually takes the name of God in Exodus 3:14, I AM, and applied it to Himself in John 8:58.  On top of this, for the skeptics who don’t take seriously ancient writings, in November of 2005, archeologists discovered in Megiddo, future location of Armageddon, the oldest Christian church ever discovered.  Evidence reveals that this church dates as for back as second or third century A.D.  Inscriptions of the floor call Jesus Christ God.  Not only does this further confirm the existence of Jesus, but established the fact that the early church believed in Jesus as God, long before Constantine in the fourth century, or even the Council of Nicea, which, the DaVinci Code states, decided on His deity, whereas in reality, it only affirmed previously known facts.. .  The development of Sunday Worship.   .                             Dan Brown states that Christians met on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, but Constantine shifted it to Sunday, the day of pagan sun veneration.  Thus, most churchgoers attend without the knowledge that they are there on account of Sun-day.  This is false.  All available evidence shows that Christians met on Sundays long before Constantine, like Acts 20:7, 1 Corinthians 16:2, both of which were written at least 200 years before Constantine was born.  Both passages talk of believers coming together on the first day of the week.  Sunday.  The Lord’s day.  Gathering on the first day of the week had nothing to do with Constantine, he wasn’t even born yet!. . Sorry that this answer is so long, but there is so much wrong with this thing that I could fill up MUCH more space than this.  These are only some of the minor issues, by the way.  Hope this helps, and God bless!

You have asked a second most fundamentally important question. The first one would have been the meaning of life. Just kidding . . The force is fictitious? Why don’t you exert some force on your teacher and when the teacher complains ask to explain why the force fictitious. However let us try something else first.. . The Sir Isaac Newton and Dr. Albert Einstein what do these men have in common? Both of them pondered the concept of gravity. Newton said that any masses will exert force upon each other and a very real force it will be F=G*M1*M2/R^2. As he said that he forgot to explain how it works and what gravity is. . . Then came Albert and introduced a concept of distorted space. The space distorted by mass of the objects and still did not explain GRAVITY.  With that notion gravitational force became notionally fictitious since it is not the force between objects that FORCES them together but the distortion in space these objects create. . .

My family. They are my life and without them i wouldn't be alive. They are my support system,my friends,my partners in crime,my life. My mother is what keeps me together and supports me through everything. My father is the bright side of my day, he makes me laugh and helps me realize how great life is. My little sister,my best friend. She is always there for me no matter what,she is the partner in crime i referred to. My older sister, we don't talk much any more...but because of her i realize how the real world is, and what lies ahead for me, the good and the bad. They are my glue and they hold me together. They mean the most to me than anything else in my life.

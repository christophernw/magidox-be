Hey honey, it`s true, some one somewhere actually did a study where a bunch of women did IQ tests and they figured out the average for each natural haircolor. Brunettes came in first, followed by black-haired women, redheads came in the third and blondes came in dead last. That`s just the way it is. but if you are not a NATURAL blonde (only 11% of women are) don`t worry about it.

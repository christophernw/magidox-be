By "statistics", what exactly do you mean?  How many marriages occured in a given state?  If you are looking for information about a specific marriage (i.e. date, names, etc), you'll need to go to the website of the county recorder's office (sometimes called the county clerk) for the county in which the marriage occured.  Sometimes this information is available online for free, usually it is not.

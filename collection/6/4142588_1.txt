Like pauliegone said, the lithosphere does in a way seperate the crust from the mantle.  The tectonis plates (crust) are supported by this semisolid layer.  However, the lithosphere is considered, by some scientists, part of the mantle.  So, it depends on which scientists you believe, although I believe that pauliegone is correct.

Human rights and the catholic church... that's cute.. . They voluntarily give up things like that, it's a sacrifice that's to be made to be in the service of God.. . Things like sex and marriage are inconsequential things in the greater scheme of God's plan, but us being human, we aren't above wanting them, which is why it's a sacrifice in the first place. Giving that up is a sign of commitment to the Church.

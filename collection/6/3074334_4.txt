It's a privacy issue.  Unless intent can be proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, then an IP address cannot be reported.  Secondly, law enforcement community would become innundated with many leads that would not secure enough convictions to justify such a heavy financial investment.  Now, this is my personal opinion; based on my own genius mind.  If people are so concerned about reporting/curbing such activity they should start an initiative designed to combat this.  I think Yahoo! would be more-than-willing to undertake such a move, provided their financial burden was minimal, if not non-existent, all-together.. Masking an IP address is not difficult, therefore, the IP address being indicative of a perpetrator's location would not necessarily mean it's his IP address.  This guy might be routing his signal through someone else's personal computer he infected with a virus.  This stuff is very costly to investigate!  I, personally, think it should be made a priority, but you know what they say:  "Money makes the world go 'round!". There are some volunteer-based organizations which center on battling such people, but the problem is that often a conviction cannot be secured until a crime, or an intent to commit a crime has taken place.. If some old troll where to approach an underage girl, in, say, a shopping mall, and this activity was reported, the most they could charge this guy with would POSSIBLY be something like lude and lascivious behavior in a public place, or harrassment.  . Keep in mind that most people on these boards do live in countries where one is innocent until proven guilty, not a Minority Report-type world.

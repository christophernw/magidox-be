Try peeling back and cutting off a corner of the tint first so you can still drive if necessary. Then try different solvents or soap to dissolve the adhesive. Once you find something that works, peel the tint from the entire windshield. It should just peel off, but it may come off in many small pieces and it will leave the adhesive on the window. I have found that a solution of Joy Concentrated Dishwashing liquid and water works best to dissolve the adhesive. Use a strong solution and keep it wet. Try applying the solution with a spray bottle, let it sit for a few seconds and use a razor blade to scratch it off.

The Catholic Church is opposed to anything and everything that is NOT of their religious belief.  It threatens to destroy them and their power.  Don't forget that the Catholic Church and the Vatican are a power unto themselves.  If such a thing were true, and I believe much of it to be truth, this of course is personal belief thru research etc, then the Catholic Church would have NO THING to declare itself as the ONLY entity that is truly in touch with God thru Christ..... . Ridiculous perhaps, but then again the reasons for religions' existences are purely to control man thru fear.

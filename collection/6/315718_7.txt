i get your point though most people are asking for personal experience on the questions that are medical,  as i have, my husband cannot eat lettuce and i was wondering if anyone has had this problem so maybe i could get some good suggestions so i could look them up and see if we could pin point his problem, though we feel as it is not medically necessary for him to see a doctor as it only happens with lettuce, some people,yes, are stupid and ask crazy questions and yes can be misleaded though i hope that they are smart enough to check the response

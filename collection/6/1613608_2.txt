Sure it's graphite, with lead you cannot write on paper (and actually it is toxic). Graphite is a form of coal and however its structure is tough enough not to become powder at first use, there are layers in it, which can be transferred to the paper (this procedure is what many calls writing).. Graphite is mixed with clay which determines the softness or hardness (in Europe names like: HB, 2B, 4H - H for hard).. From this mixture they make a long thin rod, they burn it out and... then they slice them and put the pieces into the HALVED wood coat. Then the two wood half will simply glued together.

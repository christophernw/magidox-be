We have, in the past 40 years, spent enough money on poverty to be able to give $100,000.00 to every poor person in the USA.. . If you could "cure" poverty by giving people money then we would already be done with the poverty problem. . . Governments can't do it.  It takes a healthy, growing economy, coupled with a desire by the poor person top take responsibility for his/her own success in life.

because you chose to. I know a lot of guys who pop in and out of gay status. Its up to you. I honestly don't believe it by birth or genetics or whatever, because of those I have seen and interacted with, and even common sense whould tell you that sexual orientation has nothing to do with birth as some claim. My answer is that because you chose to. You may change if you want to. Just like smoking, quit when you want to and serious about it.

Well chicken eggs like you buy in the store are just eggs that haven't been fertilised. They technically had the potential to become a baby chick, but didn't because there was no exposure to the male reproductive cells.. . And by the way, other birds DO sometimes lay eggs without babies in them. One of songbirds in my front yard had a nest with about four eggs in them, but only three hatched.. . *answer to addtion*. . The baby may have died before hatching, but there's no telling. The birds themselves can't tell if the eggs have babies in them or not. Some birds can't even tell the difference between their offspring and the offspring of others (Some deadbeat birds have capitalized on this, and lay their eggs in the nests of smaller songbirds, and letting a good mommy bird raise their kids for them!)

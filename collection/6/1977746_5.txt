Sounds like acid reflux to me.  When you lay down the acids in your stomach can sorta back up into your throat causing irritation.  Unfortunately this is pretty common and can be a very serious problem, leading to throat and/or esophagus cancer over time.  Two things you can do right away and see results are: (1) Don't eat or drink soon before you go to bed, except for maybe water, and (2) you can elevate the head of your bed even just a little bit by puttin squares of wood or something that will keep the digestive juices from backing up into your throat.  If this problem continues, of course, tell your doctor and have him/her check you out.

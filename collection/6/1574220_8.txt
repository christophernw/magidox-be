That was one of the most stupid answers ive ever heard "If we were to use their logic, then the Aztecs and the Mayans have the right to boot the Mexicans out of Mexico...". what happened to America was a colonization, that means european people went there and killed almost everyone, so americans are 100% european. what happened to Mexico was a conquer, that means european people did not kill aztecs or mayan, they just went there and had sex with all women, so now almost all mexicans are a mixture of spanish with aztecs or mayan or whatever

The easy answer to this is, there isn't. Until recently the american press just wrote whatever they were being shoveled from the white house press secretary, Scot McClellen. For example the reasons for war, the profiteering in Iraq and the ineptitude of the appointees of the current administration.. . Recently the faults of the people in charge have come to light in such dramatic ways that they can't be ignored. The people in power have become corrupt, as absolute power has a tendency to do (republican or democrat). Examples again, Tom Delay acceting bribes, the "Duke Stir" buying the 700k house, Brown's handling of the Katrina disaster.. . Now the media seems biased because there is no good new to report on the right side of the isle.. . Remeber too that just a few months ago a Republican activist was appointed to watch for leftist bias in Nation Public Radio which was such an unconstitutional scandal that he was immediately removed from his position for Right wing bias.

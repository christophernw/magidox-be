Well, I am not sure whether you are talking about your left or right hand (there is a difference between them).  About the redness on that line, I do not think it means anything special.  The redness has more to do with how light your skin is and what were you doing before you notice the line being red.  Well my best advice is that you go to the fallowing website which will give you a free palm reading.  There they will ask you more specific questions.  How accurate is it?  Well I have tried it.  Not sure if it is 100% accurate but it is fun!  http://www.greetingsamerica.net/PalmReadings.asp

This is a classic false proof.. . First, assume that a = b. a=b. . Next, multiply both sides by a. a^2 = a*b. . Then, subtract b^2 from both sides. a^2-b^2 = a*b-b^2. . Now, apply the distributive law to both sides. (a+b)(a-b) = b(a-b) . . * Followed by dividing both sides by (a-b) *. (a+b) = b. . Substitute all a's for b's (remember, if a = b you can do this). a+a = a. . Regroup the two a's in the left side, and rename it 2a. 2a = a. . Finally, divide both sides by a. 2 = 1. . The point which I asterisked is where you would have to divide each side of . . (a+b)(a-b)=b(a-b) . . by (a-b) to get. . (a+b)=b. . But you will notice that if the first part of the proof (a=b) is true, then (a-b) would equal 0. . . And, as we know, we can't divide by 0, so from that point on this "proof" that 1=2 is relegated to the non-valid, but interestingly, heap of other things which people try to use to prove things which are also false.

In simple terms the Open sky Policy basically means allowing foreign Airlines into the country to operate their flights to and from the destinations in the country without any restrictions. I think the advantages the country will derive are a competitive and consumer-oriented market and convenience to the consumers.I think the main beneficiaries will be the travellers who will benefit from the competition.

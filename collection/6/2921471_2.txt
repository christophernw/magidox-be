Was this an alarm that was added to the car after it was new? If it is, there should be a valet switch under the dash board( Driver side) near the fire wall. Its a small toggle switch that lets you disarm the alarm but allows the locks to still function. If you have one, turn the ignition to "on" but don't start the car. Move the toggle switch to the opposite position, your disarm light should light. up at this time. If you have two buttons on your remote,turn the ignition to "on" but don't start the car, keep the drivers door open,.  press and hold the #1 button for 3 seconds, release it and press and hold the #2 button for 3 seconds and release it,  finally press and hold the # 1 button again for another 3 seconds and release it. That should cause the red disarm light to stay lit. Do the same to re-arm the alarm . That was the basic instruction for both my car alarms from two different manufactures.. . Good luck...

its less economical for airlines because so few people travel single way, airlines expect 99.99% of passengers to return with them at some point, plus if you travel single they might think your desparate to get out there and won't buy a return because your unsure of your return date, ( good example would be a death in the family ) travel out there but they'll be complications so you may not know when to return, So airlines take advantage of them.

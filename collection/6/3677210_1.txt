The "greatest thinkers in history" who got RECOGNITION were men...it is impossible to know what great female minds were repressed because of unfair male dominance. Women weren't even able to vote in the United States, the supposed land of the free, until 1920. Do you think it is a coincidence that almost all of the "greatest thinkers" were WHITE MEN? It doesn't mean white men are any more intelligent than any other segment of society; it just means that white men have been the major power players.

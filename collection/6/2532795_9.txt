tell them of gods promise to do away with pain and suffering........However, those distressing effects that we inherited from our first parents will soon be a thing of the past. Do you remember what Jesus demonstrated regarding health while he was on earth? The Bible relates: "Great crowds approached him, having along with them people that were lame, maimed, blind, dumb, and many otherwise, and they fairly threw them at his feet, and he cured them; so that the crowd felt amazement as they saw the dumb speaking and the lame walking and the blind seeing."—Matthew 15:30, 31.. . What great happiness will come in the new world as all our ills are eliminated! The suffering that results from poor health will never again torment us. "No resident will say: 'I am sick.'" "At that time the eyes of the blind ones will be opened, and the very ears of the deaf ones will be unstopped. At that time the lame one will climb up just as a stag does, and the tongue of the speechless one will cry out in gladness."—Isaiah 33:24; 35:5, 6.

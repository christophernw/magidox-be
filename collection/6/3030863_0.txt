The quality of life in the UK doesnt even compare to the US. The UK is just as multicultural (except 4 the population of latinos) as the US. Also, there is not such a big barrier when dating and marrying other races. People are alot less ignorant there, they have a richer culture, they are in a better location (you can travel all over europe 4 cheap), they have better food products in the supermarket, waaaaay better transportation system and excellent education. So, basically, the US DOESNT EVEN COME TO THE UK'S ANKLES. USA SUX

Hindsight is 20/20, isn't it a joy to have for you.  If we went into Korea before they got "the bomb" leftists would be screaming that Korea has done nothing wrong and that we should be involved elsewhere, staying out of the way of the Korea's right to progress, like with Iran now.  And going into Iraq was to remove a threat, not to relieve the poor of the world, our military isn't some giant "Arsenal of Welfare".  FDR isn't our president anymore and we're a capitalist nation, the poor can survive, although Darwin says they shouldn't.

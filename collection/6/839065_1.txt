In genetics, complementary DNA (cDNA) is DNA synthesized from a mature mRNA template. cDNA is often used to clone eukaryotic genes in prokaryotes.. . . Overview. The central dogma of molecular biology outlines that in synthesizing proteins, DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is translated into protein. One difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic mRNA is that eukaryotic mRNA can contain introns (intervening sequences), which are not coding sequences, per se, and must be spliced out of the mRNA before it is translated into protein. Prokaryotic mRNA has no introns, so it is not subject to splicing.

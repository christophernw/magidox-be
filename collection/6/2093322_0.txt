My exhusband Anthony, he was very organized on how he stalked me, in the morning, afternoon and evening. When I walked out of the house in the morning he would be sitting on the porch, he would be at my job outside on my lunch breaks and he would just so happened to be driving down the street when I maded home from work. Now tell me that is not organized stalking, he had to organize his day around me. That is why I organized the divorce papers and filed then.

There's a problem here.... . Does the one who believes in a supreme being accept the possibility that this is the only life they will have, etc.?. . Does someone who doesn't believe in a supreme being or miracles, not believe its possible that a supreme being exists, or miracles could occur?. . I conclude they are both equal in their mindedness, given the fact that they both hold open the possibility of the other being right, but don't think it likely.. . Cases of logically impossible events (square circles, burning ice, etc.) are rejected by both for valid reasons.. . So throwing in the "accepts everything is possible" is loading the question at the start and a blatant lie.

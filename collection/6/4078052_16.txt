Currently 13 is considered to be an unlucky number. However, I am told it used to be--and in some earth-worshipping, i.e.,      , religions still is--a lucky and magical number. Consequently there were 13 months and 13 zodiac signs (the Gemini twins had separate identities). Knowing how Christianity and other god-as-a-man-based religions were prone to say that what the      s (Earth-and-god-as-a-woman) considered good was bad. So really the number 13 is lucky, but in some places its unlucky for some odd reason, so 13 is not unlucky at all!

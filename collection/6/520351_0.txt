My mother described suffering an affair like losing a loved one in death.   Really painful.  You have to morn and greive over the experience, but at some point (for your own sake) you have to let go or hatred and anger will eat you up inside and change you into a different person.  And no one, not even your husband of 9 years should have that kind of power over you.

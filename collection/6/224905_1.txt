Have plenty of munchies and drinkies!. Good music, and a good MIX of people help a lot.. Have some games to play, like Taboo, Win lose or Draw, Balderdash, Trivial Pursuit, or even Twister!!. . Circulate, and make everyone feel at home, introduce those who don't know each other.. . I wish you luck & fun!

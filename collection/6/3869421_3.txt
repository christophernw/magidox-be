I don't belong to an organized religion but I believe in God. I believe in the trinity. I am born again believer. I believe that religion is man-made and some people in that religion use it as a crutch with no sound knowledge of the bible. Why I believe in God because He has always been there for me in the worst times. God saved my life several times even from birth. I am a God given miracle and my 1 yr old son is too.

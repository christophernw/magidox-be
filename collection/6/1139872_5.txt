Does it really have to be a fight or could it just a bunch of ordinary people sitting at a table talking about Gay rights. I think it would made better history for our country than fighting and killing people. Why can't we just sit and talk. Maybe we could learn a few things by listening what they have to say. For the government I am sure it is considered  waste of time. Can't we do anything for our future generation that are already growing?

In anthropology, polygamy is the practice of marriage to more than one partner at the same time. Polygamy comes mainly in two forms: Polyandry (one wife, several husbands) is rather rare and mostly covers relationships where several men share a wife; on the other hand there is the far more common polygyny (one husband, several wifes).. In everyday language polygamy is used when people are cactually talking about polygyny.

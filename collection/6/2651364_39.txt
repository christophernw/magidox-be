yeah, it was rude, but that doesn't mean you're in the wrong. Christians are notorious for being disrespectful. So many of them push their snake-oil religion on the rest of the world with the attitude that they are doing mankind some great service, when in fact they are driving the rest of the world mad. . . I don't put up with it anymore, but I don't tell them to F-off. I sugar coat it. Try "no thanks" and if that doesn't work, "Don't make me repeat myself", and if that doesn't work, "Look pal! Get lost", and if that doesn't work, well, you just might have to resort to violence.. . -After reading the numerous posts on this question, I find it incredible how many Christians are using the "open your mind" approach. Really??? Think about it. Christians have ALREADY made up their minds. They ALREADY think they have the answers. How can they possibly tell a non-Christian to have an "open mind" with a straight face??? It's kinda like a Klansman telling you not to act like a racist.

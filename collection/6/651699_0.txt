If you think you get a bad deal, feel free to commit a crime and spend your time in prison, clothed, fed, doctored (poorly), confined, censored, beaten, extorted and raped.. . Or try this answer:  you ask why does the US Government have to follow the law, and isn't free to do whatever it wants, to criminals? Maybe because if it doesn't have to follow the law, it doesn't have to when it deals with those who aren't criminals either.

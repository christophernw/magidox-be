you have an problem called: Anger explosive disorder. It is something that is new in the world well at least the therapist just named it and found out they could invent something new after years of talking of anger and fear.  I think someone to speak too would be a great idea for you. Go see a counsellor of somekind that listens not talks the whole session. Talk to your parents or a friend too is good. Try to realize when it is triggered and why, is the first step. Good luck to you.

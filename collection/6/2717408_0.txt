You need to conduct exit interviews before employees leave to find out the reasons why. Are they underpaid? Over worked? Feel un appreciated? Does your competition offer a work/life balance or other benefits you dont? Is the commute too far? Does your competitor have a nicer facility or a more open communication policy? . . You cant fix the problem if you dont know what it is. Part of employee retention is communicating with your employee teams to get a better idea of what morale is like, if your employees are happy and be open to suggestion from your employees. . . Also, you must shop your competitor and see what it is that they offer that you arent and consider making similar changes.. . Im not sure if you are a small business owner or part of a large corp. I could probably be more help if i knew more about the set up of your company and why you think your employee is leaving, etc.

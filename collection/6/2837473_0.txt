"Eating grass is basically a normal behavior for dogs, one which experts have given varying theories as to why they do this. Some believe that since dogs commonly vomit after eating grass, they eat grass in order to vomit. They may have an upset stomach or have eaten something bad and thus feel compelled to induce vomiting. Those who believe this think then that it's important that you not discourage your dog from eating grass when he feels so inclined. Another theory is that, in the wild, the normal diet of canids like wolves and foxes includes grass, whether they're actively seeking it out or eating herbivores. Because of this then, grass can also be considered a normal part of a dog's diet. And yet another theory is a rather simple one. Dogs eat grass simply because they like it. In fact, there may be certain species of plants and grasses that are particularly appealing to dogs. Unless your dog is eating grass excessively, it's really not a concern and you needn't be worried about it. "

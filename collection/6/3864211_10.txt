I know there is a lot of stuff out there you can purchase from your Vet or pet store. None of it ever worked for me. . . Some dogs do it and some don't. We had a dog that would only eat poop out of the kitty litter box. We had one dog that didn't care, dog or cat poop, he ate it. . .  I now have a Maltese. He hates poop of any kind. He is trained to piddle pads. When he has a bowel movement, he walks way around the pad. He doesn't want anything to do with it. He wants me to get rid of it as soon as possible. SOOOOOOOO, figure that one out.................. . The thing that I learned with the others was, clean it up immediately. When mine would go outside, I went behind them with a pooper scooper and got rid of it. Which you should do anyway. . . My dogs have always been fed the best food, up  to date on all shots, take vitamins, they are treated like people treat their kids. (the good parents) And as I said, nothing has helped. . . I guess the moral to this story is, once a poop eater, always a poop eater...........I know that is not funny, but I couldn't help it.

Some people take their politics and views on the economy VERY serious.  Such as the republican trickle down theory.  I believe it is not right because I feel human greed will make the CEOs pocket the money and no reinvesting will occur.  However someone who believes that economic philosophy, they would argue until we were both blue in the face saying how the trickle down theory is the epitome of economic growth because reinvestment capitol is how businesses creat new jobs for the economy.  By the way, I believe that easing the tax burden on the lower and middle class give the spending power to the regular people who can then decide how the market should flow by creating the demands to let the companies know what to start producing.. . That is just one example of how true beliefs of what path the country needs to follow can lead to intense debate.  Because on economic paths, it effects the whole nation.  The path we take will determine prosperity or ruin and with stakes that high for so many people, people generaly will stand by and defend what they say vigorously.. . Also, there are some who have been victims of political attack.  Both parties are capable of stong arming compition.  To those who have been on the recieving end of this, it really is personal when issues come up.

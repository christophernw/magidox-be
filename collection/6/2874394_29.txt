Are you kidding?!!!! maybe you should ask your child if he/she could give up eating and clothes. SHAME ON YOU . your child did not ask to be born it is your responsibility to take care of your child. It makes me sick how many people out there have kids and do not take care of them. Perhaps you think it is the states problem and tax payer's should pay for your child.....WHAT!!!!!

My advice.....Dont work at the stip club! It's not worth selling your dignity for a few measly dollars. You will receive much more satisfaction working at a grocery store or a gas station, not to mention the peace of mind. If you need a career advice, then become a nurse...we don't have enough of them -- you will be helping a lot of people (other than the perverts at the strip club)

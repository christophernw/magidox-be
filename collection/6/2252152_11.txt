You invested youself and your emotions and it didn't work out, that hurts and you have every right to cry.. . About the crying. Do it when you need to  Give yourself permission to just cry and cry for a set amount of time. When the time is up get a pillow and let out one final good long loud scream and then take some slow deep breaths and then splash some cold water on your face and drink some cold water.

God created "Elements" first.Three elements carbon,hydrogen,and oxygen interacted to produce "Organic matter" next.More complex organic matter came next.A "single cell" came next.It was totipotent (capable of producing-like a STEM CELL- anything).Egg is one such "Big cell".Egg produced both a male anf female version of "chicken".(as twins).If chicken came first where is the question of having an egg without a partner of opposite sex?

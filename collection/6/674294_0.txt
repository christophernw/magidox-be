Im an auzzie, and Ive never heard the phrase, but I will tell you, if you want to feed a kangaroo, particularly a big red fella, prepare to get the thrashing of your life. They are not cute as they are depicted, little ones are mild mannered, but ALL have long razor claws on front and back feet, and massive muscles designed to kick each other with. The red ones can be 8ft tall or more, so yeah, auzzies know, you dont feed kangaroos...we usually shoot em and eat em!

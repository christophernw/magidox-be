All i know is the path of blood flow. Blood in veins are blue and blood in arteries are red. The blood is pumped from the inferior vena cave and superior vena cava to the right atrium. Then it is pushed to the right ventricle. After that it passez through the pulmonary artery and out. Then it comes back through the pulmonary veins and is now red. It passes through the left atrium into the left ventricle. After passing through the mitral valve it gets pumped out of the heart and everything starts all over again. Thanks, hope I helped!

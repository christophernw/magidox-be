you make your destiny...I believe it is all set out, but you have to do it!! I don't know if this makes sense, but if you go out tomorrow and decide to move to a different country and marry the first person who will marry you the it was destiny but it wouldn't have happened if you didn't DO it, so don't stay in a situation because you think it's your destiny!!

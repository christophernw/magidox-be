I can't understand what your feeling right now . But you need to know that God did NOT kill your friend. She made a choice to take the drugs. It's true that people might learn from this but God never wants to cause us pain. He loves us too much. I know it doesn't make sense now, we might never understand the plans or ways that the Lord does things. But you can know that God did not plan this but we all make descisions that lead us to were we end up in life.  I hope this helped but if you need anything you can email me at eamane4@yahoo.com

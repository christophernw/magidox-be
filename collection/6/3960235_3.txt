First off...why in god's name would you even think of putting flea medication that is made for DOGS on a cat? What's perfectly fine for a dog, can kill a feline. They're a different species, in case you have not noticed. You're not even supposed to give a cat dog food.....are you too cheap or naive to buy a flea killer/preventive that is made for cats?. . Second, get the cat to a vet ASAP.It's in danger of dying because of your goof-up. If you're serious about keeping this cat, learn how to properly care for them.

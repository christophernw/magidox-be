I think it's good to pray out loud in church, so that everyone can pray together for each other's personal troubles.. Watching for what prayers "don't come true" means tempting God: is He doing His job or what? It means also judging the prayer of other people, who might do a better job if they prayed differently. In church we pray, we don't judge.

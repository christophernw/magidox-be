Hinduism, because I have studied many religions and have found in Hinduism the teachings that make the most sense to me.  I have found it to be the path that works for me effectively to reach my fullest potential.  I also like Buddhism and other eastern religions, as well as Judaism.  I actually find a lot in EVERY religion I've ever studied that I can learn from.  All are beautiful in their own way.. . I see religions as different paths to the same Ultimate Goal or Eternal Truth.  We may call it different names, but it is the same.  We just see it from different angles.  Hinduism recognizes this.

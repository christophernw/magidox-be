They do in Nevada.  However, no, it would not bring down the rape rate.  I also don't support the government becoming a pimp.  We have gone downhill enough with our morals already.  It also would spread HIV, no matter how much you test.  I really don't want to raise my kids in a society where prostitution is acceptable, either.

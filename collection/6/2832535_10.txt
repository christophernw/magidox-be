They have to put a placebo (sugar pill) in a controlled test, because some people feel better when they are taking anything. So, if they do a test and 40% of the people felt better taking the pill, the controlled group is the placebo group. They will ask them the same question, and it's usually between 5% and 10% will say it helped them. So, they have to subtract that from the main group. Example, 40% minus 5% means that it only helped 35% of the people. . . Hope that makes sense, it's kind of strange that people have that much faith in pills that it will help them taking sugar. I guess that says something for positive thinking.

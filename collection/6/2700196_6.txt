Did your vet give you any recommendations? You don't want to just start over feeding it. If you haven't table fed it might not be a good idea to start now - but my dog will come up and sit next to us while we're eating and it kinda gets annoying - but we do give into her. You can try giving her some cooked chicken or meat... just check with your vet before just stuffing her with food. Good luck.

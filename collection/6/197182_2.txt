having a kid is very expensive but necessary, traveling is expensive too.  i have my wages direct deposited to my checking acount, and then i have an automatic deposit from checking to my online savings account every pay period.  it is not much but it adds up and you earn interest.  by the way you should definitely have savings, especially with a child.

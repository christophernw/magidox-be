Is it normal for you to skip periods?  Some women go a long time without menstrating natuarally but if you're not one of them something is definitely wrong.  Are you extremely underweight?  Could you be pregnant?  Have you just recovered from an illness?  Are you nursing?  Are you on birth control?  If you answered yes to any of these you might be ok.  Otherwise, please take a day off work and go to the doctor.  You probably have a hormonal problem that can be easily corrected with medication.  Stress can cause your period to be a few days or weeks late, but never 6 months.  Take care.

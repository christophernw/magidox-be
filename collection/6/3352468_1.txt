It's a matter of physics. Just as 2 objects can not occupy the same space at the same time, a single object can not occupy more than one space at the same time. Therefore, your cake can not occupy your stomach and the plate at the same time. However, it is possible for half an object to occupy one space while the other half occupies a totally different space, so you could cut the cake in half and you could have half a cake and eat half a cake too.. And you were right to put this question in the mental health category, because mentally you want to eat the cake, but cake has a lot of fat and sugar, so it isn't healthy.

I spent two years knocking on doors sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ. My church did not require me to do it, I wanted to do it and have never regreted it. I did it because I knew that God wanted me to, and I felt that I ought to give everyone the chance to at least hear what I knew. . So don't let anybody knocking on your door anoy you, they're just doing what they believe is right, and if you really don't want to talk to them just yell through the door that no one is home. They'll laugh and keep going :-)

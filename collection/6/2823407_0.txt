Hi there...if a cat is sleeping more than it generally has been in the past as well as not eating nor drinking  consider ringing your vet first thing in the morning to discuss your cat's condition and they can determine if it's necesary to have your kitty come in and be  evaluated.    A dry nose doesn't necessary mean anything as cats can have both dry and wet noses when they are well.

If you are trying to pull water out of gas, ammonia wouldnt be a good idea, you would likely have an explosion, or some kind of reaction that you wouldnt want. get yourself some anhydrous sodium sulfate, and mix it in the gasoline, it should absorb any water in the gas, because the water with hydrate the sodium sulfate crystals, and remain solid. I hope this answers your question! And dont worry about the sodium sulfate dissolving in the gas, its not soluble in gas, it will fall to the bottom of the gas, then you can carefully pour the gas out into another container, leaving the water and sodium sulfate behind in the first container.

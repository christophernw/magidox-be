the eggs help bind the mix together. But if you have already started to bake them and they have cooked less than about 5 min. you can try remixing in a fresh bowl, and clean and regrease the pan before pouring back.. but if you are just baking for yourself and not anyone that matters ... finish as is .. they might be ok. But if for a bake sale or a way to your sweeties heart, I'd dump it and start over...

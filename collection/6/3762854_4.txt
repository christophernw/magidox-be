sound is created when air ( or any gas ) contracts and expands.  it is NOT the vibrating object that actually creates sound but the air vibrations hitting your ear that causes you to percieve sound.. . unlike the other answers given, the vocal cords vibrate at the same degree when helium is present, but the helium "vibrates at a faster rate because it is lighter.  this results in an increased percieved pitch which you hear as your voice rising.

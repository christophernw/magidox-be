Thats like saying why are people tall? Not all people ate tall, not all churches touch little boys.  I think some ministers are not allowed to have a wife, it depends on the church, and that causes sexual frustration, which causes some people to turn into paedophilles. I don't condone this, nor do I condone the idea that ministers (or pastors/fathers...whatever you want to call them) are not allowed to be married.

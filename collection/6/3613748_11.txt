Seph, did ya read that other story? The one about the Male and female Ho_okers who drew a plan of the White House bedrooms for the FBI? Pretty funny stuff, also kinda scary, it's Halloween.. BTW, it is a bare face lie that we are fighting terrorist in Iraq. A terrorist will not stand and fight. Terrorist are cowards they do the dirty work behind your back. Just like in Nam. The Republicans love the liar and embrace the lie as the truth. I also do not agree that Republicans were wise putting how to build a bomb on the Internet. Sorry Neocons Clinton had nothing to do with sept. 11th. that was on Bush's watch. Bush got a PDB warning him about Sept.11th. called "terrorist determined to attack America". Bush was also told in this PDB that they would use hi jacked comm. planes to blow up buildings and that they were already in this country. Only a Idiot would blame Clinton for Bush's actions. It was Bush and Rice who called that PDB a "historical document", Get a clue.

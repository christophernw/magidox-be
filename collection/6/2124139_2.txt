jboysmom has a good answer. I too associate "laying on of hands" with faith healing or faith-based therapy. . . Reiki, cranial-sacro therapy, and energy healing are based around the idea that the body has an electrical field that can become "blocked" or somehow "misaligned." The practitioner "manipulates" this energy to effect a cure.. . I don't buy it. I'm not particularly religious, but I think I'd trust faith-based healing more than paying someone to massage my "aura."

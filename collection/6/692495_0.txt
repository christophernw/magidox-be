It most likely means that you have either a "U.T.I." (urinary tract infection) or a bladder infection. Either way, they can be painful and are easily treatable with antibiotics. Go to your doctor as soon as possible- they can test a urine sample and diagnose you within 24 hours- the test and treatment are pain free, so don't wait any longer than necessary! Hope you are feeling better soon!

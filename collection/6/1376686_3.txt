its said that there is a biological clock in every organism.just like hair turning grey in humans,trees shed their leaves during winter. trees respond to climatic conditions like decreased light intensity & temperature by releasing protiens.this can be traced to genes.. also ,with time, production of certain protiens in the body might decrease .this is the main cause of ageing. in few organisms with abnormal protien release ,there might be chances of early early ageing.. genes contain these informations .the information is transfered to the next generation as they inherit genes from their parents.

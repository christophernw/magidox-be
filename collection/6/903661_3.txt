Because they choose to lie to win a case even though they know they are lying.  Also it's because they are after money made off anothers bad fortune.  Why do they have to charge 33% in lawsuits. That's outrageous!  I really don't know what to think of Public Defenders though.  I think they make a salary and don't get rich one way or the other.

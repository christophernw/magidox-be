You shouldn't. Not at first anyway. Wittgenstein spent a lot of time, arguing or disagreeing with people, so read other first.. Like Tolstoy, or Descartes, or Dostoevsky. . Perhaps, Plato if you want the basis for most of western Philosophy. Descartes for the re-animation of Philosophical thought. Perhaps Heraclitus, for some real old-school Pre-Socratian Philosophy. A J Ayer, & the Gettier counter-examples, the basis for modern thought into knowledge itself (well worth a read, espeacially the Gettier counter-examples to Justified True Belief. Not hard to find, it's the only paper he ever published).... . The list is endless. Just don't start off with Wittgenstein. If you start with him, & he becomes your basis for philosophical writing, you'll find it hard motivating yourself to read philosophy.

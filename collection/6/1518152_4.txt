to speak in tounges means that the holy spirit has taken over your body and is inpowering you to do this.but a true toung talker with a message from god comes it twos a speaker and a interperter.if their is no inteperter its propply not from god or the holy spirit.but if a person know aramaic they can pray to the lord in toung but not in a group because anyone can clam to talk in toungs but a real toung talker from god he also sends someine to relay this message to everyone.  flipflopme1973@YAHOO.COM

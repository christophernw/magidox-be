While the other posters are correct that a Pardon will free a person from punishment for a crime, it is not the only document that will achieve this result.. . Any "judgment" or "order" issued by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, which sets aside/vacates a person's prior conviction of a crime, necessarily frees that person from any further punishment.. . Generally, a criminal judgment may be set aside on grounds of fraud, duress, mistake, illegality, or newly discovered evidence which could not have previously been found through diligent use of the legal discovery process.

Well yr question seems very complicated. What i can recommened is that dont take any medicine continiously..         Emptying stomach dont need any medicine for lifelong period..         Try some natural things. For example when u wake up in the morning drink hot water with some lime juice in it. Eat more fruit pulps and drink lots of water throughout the day. I hope as u r a swimmer u will get fine in few days..       Iam a pro fitness trainer , If u need furthur guide u can contact me on tutul_chakraborti@yahoo.com. . Best of luck buddy!

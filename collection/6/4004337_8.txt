Every nation on earth has a basic design for a nuclear weapon . If they had the ability to make one they would . Also they all know about biological weapons and chemical bombs . What do you want to do ?  Turn back the clock to a time when we had no knowledge of these things .. It is what a nation does with this knowledge or does not do .. Take Switzerland for instance . Leaving people alone and going about its own business it is the worlds only nation that has eliminated poverty . It has a medical treatment system that is at the leading edge of medicine and surgical treatments . By determining not to waste its resources on war and allowing people to decide for themselves if they will use drugs or not and by letting freedom of choice lead the people it is a shining example of true democracy and freedom .

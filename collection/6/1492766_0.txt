I think the parties' focuses are quite different. Dems usually focus on the policies and because of that they tend to have loosely centralized structure with skilled specialists in each subject areas.  By contrast, the republicans tend think of more of how they look rather than focusing on specifics of policies.  As a result, they tend to produce a master-minded, centralized figure such as Rove.

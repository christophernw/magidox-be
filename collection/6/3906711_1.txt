Hi! . I am a University admissions advisor and a licensed real estate broker. The previous answers are completely incorrect. This is the truth. In order to succeed in real estate, you need to achieve certain things in your life before you start your career. First, high school graduation, then at least an associates degree with some business, finance and marketing courses. Next, you need to find pre-licensing classes (preferably through a large broker, like Coldwell Banker, ReMax etc.) since they offer an accelerated practical approach to licensing that includes real world experience. The instructor will most likely be a broker with ample experience in the business. Then you need to take a state licensing test to be a real estate agent. At that point, you may want to work as a licensed real estate assistant for a year or so to get some experience in the field. Then, I believe you will be prepared to start a SUCCESSFUL career in real estate. Some states are starting to require a college degree (at least undergrad) so by the time you are ready to do this, it will most likely be a requirement. Good luck to you. I am impressed that you are thinking of a career already.

Well, I'm not sure. The Bible doesn't seem to tell about everything that ever existed. God probably made them, but they came at an earlier time. I've noticed that the Bible says that it took God six days to create the Earth, and then took a day of rest. But scientists say dinosaurs lived much before us. My logic is that the "days" were much longer periods of time than what we call "days" now. Idk...

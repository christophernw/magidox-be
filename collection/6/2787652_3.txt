well it's like in fishing. If you know there is a great fish in the water that you really want because you know it's a biggie, and you know that you would have your picture taken with it and published in every fishermans magazine because it's a beauty, invariably, this is the fish you can't catch or hook. That fish is so good it's off the hook. It's too good to be caught. It's too beautiful to be reeled in.. . Not a bad answer for someone who has no idea about fishing !

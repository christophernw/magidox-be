At the bottom of your question,after you select the catagory its under right below that it has a little box and it has a mark in it,you can click it so it doesnt have a mark in it and that eliminates the emails everytime you get an answer.. Mark=Emails everytime you get an answer to your question. No Mark=no emails everytime you get an answer . Good Luck!

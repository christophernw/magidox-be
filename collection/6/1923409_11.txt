Honestly I think you should show you some interest but dont try to hard because that really is a turn off. And be her friend and nice and caring and all the qualities we want in a man and she will see through you, dont beg thats nasty and dont pose and dont come on to hard. Make her feel like in the end you will come out, because she is worth more than that. And if you want her that bad, just keep your head high and keep trying and ONE MAIN thing is wait for her and sometimes the longest closest friends work out longer in the long run anyways! GOOD LUCK HUN!! my prays with you. Bre :)

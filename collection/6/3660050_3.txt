I ordered 3 Bettas from Thailand and they were packed in double plastic bags with heat packs designed to travel with fish. Pretty ingenious. All 3 got here just fine and they are *lovely*.. Most sellers on Aquabid explain how they ship fish and also have feedback ratings so you can see how they've done in the past.

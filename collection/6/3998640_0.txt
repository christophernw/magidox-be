Surprisingly, it was started as a 'mom-and-pop' family practice by Dr. William Worrall Mayo and his two sons in the late 1800s.  In fact, Dr. William Mayo, Jr. said "We came along in medicine like farm boys do on a farm."  And to think their clinic would become one of the most prestigious medical centers in the world a century later.  Pretty amazing.

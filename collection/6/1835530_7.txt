It is not just low skill jobs that are being outsourced.  I know of a few large corporations that have recently opened extremely large research facilities in China.  These corporations are recruiting chinese nationals at universities to fill these labs, all the while not hiring American born scientists because the  US research facilities are either stagnant or shrinking.. . What scares me the most is that one of these companies has many government military contracts.  How much of our national security is going to depend on research conducted in china?. . I have no answers on how to stop it.

if you look at the nose area (cere) just above the beak you will see that is will most likely be either blue or pink in color depending on whether it is mating season or not. if it is blue in color it is a boy (male) if it is pink it is a girl (female) during mating season, it might turn a brownish color or become lighter in color. This is the best way to tell without having a dna test done. Hope this helps and enjoy those parakeets.

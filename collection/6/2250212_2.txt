Once you've scraped all the old growth off it, an automotive buffing wheel with a polishing compound does a great job, just keep it moving. Once it's clean, add about 3-4 coats of a good hard automotive wax, such as carnuba. Below the water line, lightly hand sand, wash with Dawn or some other grease remover, rinse and let dry thoroughly. Then mask off your water line, and give it two coats of a good marine bottom paint. Do not wax into this area!! A good bottom paint also reduces drag, and increases hull speed.. Regular fresh water washdowns after every use will maintain it in prime condition.

Satin is the master of deception.He has deceived .  multitudes in following the wide path.Just like he.  told" Eve SURLY YOU WON"T DIE " he continues to tell  mankind "Surly there is not a God look at the world and the mess it is in,Surly you can please God by doing good works and God will let you in heaven",man you are like a dog when you die you just cease to be SO eat drink and be merry for tomorrow you might die"  and on and on and on.Man . keeps on believing the devil and marching to hell..  Pro 14:12  There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. .     The reason most people don't like the Bible is that it exposes that we are sinful by nature (Adam and Eve are our blood relatives all mankind has Adams blood in our veins.King David described this in Psa 51:5  Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. Life starts at conception and that person is of Adams Blood a sinner.We naturally love to dabble in sin..    The Bible is a SPIRITUAL BOOK!Unless God has saved us we CAN NOT UNDERSTAND IT. 1Co 2:14  But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. The only way natural man will understand the Bible is for God to open his understanding and give lost man the Grace to be saved.. 1Co 2:12  Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God..   When you are Born of God the Bible becomes a Love. Letter to mankind. 1Jo 4:10  Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.1Jo 4:19  We love him, because he first loved us. .    I personally believe the last words a lost person hears as they drop off into hell is from God. and he says I LOVED YOU AND DID ALL I COULD DO TO. KEEP YOU OUT OF THIS PLACE!!  Have you trusted Jesus yet?I pray that today will be the day of salvation for whosoever will believe Jesus was born of a virgin,Jesus shed his Blood to take your punishment,Jesus was bodily resurrected the third day according to scriptures.Receive by Faith Jesus as Lord and follow Jesus Word..                In Christ in Love,.                    TJ57

In the Bible, it says that God gave us the animals of the earth for food. This was a while after he had told Adam and Eve that they could only eat vegetables, so maybe your friends have drawn their conclusions from that?. . I personally am extremely grateful that we can eat meat. I got scare put my wits when I read that people could only eat vegetables (before i read we can eat meat also)

Blend the colors together.... . ex:. ** white/ fair skin tone - flesh and a little pink and a little white. ** brown / tan skin tone - brown and white. ** dark skin tone - dark brown and a little black. ** yellow skin tone - a little yellow and flesh. . well it's all up to your preference what color you want them to be. Just test in a scratch paper and see if it's right. Trial and error...

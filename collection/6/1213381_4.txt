The klan was after black people and were cowards that covered their faces so as not to be identified.  Terrorists also cover their faces for the same reason.  This is a different kind of war with a different kind of enemy and although there are racists in the USA the USA is NOT racist  I am a Democrat but do not defame Republicans as they want the same things we want they just pursue it different ways  The Bible says an eye for an eye, therefore anything the USA has done there is child's play compared to them.  I am a liberal and I think you are too but PLEASE get your priorities right.

I personally never get upset when someone questions my religious beliefs.  They have a right to do so.  You do realize that not all atheists word their questions as respectfully as you have.  I have been called a fool, stupid, redneck, delusional, and some other things I can't repeat because I do have faith.   So, it comes down to some people are disrespectful and others are not, regardless of their beliefs.

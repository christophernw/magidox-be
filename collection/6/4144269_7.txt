because they dont like . 1. the idea of harry potter. 2. harry's publicity. 3. j.k. row. 4. the book. 5. magic. 6....and so on and so on. Its like asking why people are always saying bad stuff about rap music, or why people say trash about rock music, or perhaps country.. I dont really like Harry's character in the book (too much of a hero to me, whats his flaw? Is he gay? Does he masturbate???) and I would love to read about Hermione dying, but hey, I like the series.

When Jesus commanded his disciples to call no man Father, he meant none of the religious leaders of his day, especially the Pharisees. In time, Paul will refer to himself as Timothy's "spiritual father". This tradition has stuck.. . The Gospel clearly teaches that "all generations will call [Mary] blessed".. . When the wise men bent the knee to Jesus in adoration, they would have looked up to see what is commonly depicted as a statue in many Catholic churches... a young woman with a child in her arms. Catholics wish to recall that sacred image.

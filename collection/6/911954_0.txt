no intrapreneurship is a word as well - it's when a person starts a new business/division within an already established company.. . Usually this happens because a particularly bright or creative executive comes up with a new idea and then gets buy in from the higher ups to start his own thing within the company. the good thing about this is that the person is not investing his/her own money so the risks are not as high as entrapreneurship but the downside is that if it's a success they don't get all the rewards because it is still owned by the company.. . "An intrapreneur is a person within a large corporation who takes direct responsibility for turning an idea into a profitable, finished product through assertive risk taking and innovation."

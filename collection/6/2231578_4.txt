awesome... got a lot of landscaping done...got rid of things I didn't need.. found a chaise I like  ,but didn't want to pay alot for it...have been searching for a few years.. found one for $30.00 the same exact color & style as  my favorite chair !!.  Oh and someone gave me new curatins they didn't fell like exchanging... exactly what I was looking for..and they had just washed them and all folded neatly.

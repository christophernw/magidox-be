Lets see favorite yugioh monster? I like alot of them like man eater bug. I have to say Jinzo because it completely revolutionized the game and made people think twice before loading their decks with traps. And I like the art too. Dark magician of chaos is cool also. I love its effect. It makes me wonder it isn't so popular. The effect could change the outcome of the game quickly.

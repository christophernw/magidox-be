Both wars (war traditional always) boast the economy. But we didn't go to war to boast the economy. Here is a thought read, study what happened and form an your own opinion instead of listing to alot of people who instead of studying the facts formed their opinion based on what someone else told them. Alot of people have died so you would have the wright to learn the truth an form an opinion. In a communist country they just tell you what your opinion is.

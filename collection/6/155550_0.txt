You would list the entire balance of what is still owed at the date of the balance sheet.. . The balance sheet is a snapshot in time of the company assets, liabilities, and equity.. . The amount of the monthly payment would be deducted from the total balance of what is owed each time...but in the balance sheet you list all of what is still owed.. . However, if you are doing a classified balance sheet, you would list only what is owed within a year in the "current assets" section, and the rest in the "long term liabilities" section.

Sounds to me like you're asking about what's known as "vacuum energy" or "zero-point energy." Normal space seems featureless and without any variations, but if we could examine a chunk of space that's about 10^minus 20 times smaller than a proton we'd find that it's like a constantly seething kind of foam filled with peaks and valleys of energy. It's in this quantum realm that subatomic particles appear from what seems to be empty space. These so-called virtual particles almost instantly self-annihilate so there's no true violation of the laws of conservation.. . The bottom line is that the vacuum of space is a whole lot more than it seems.

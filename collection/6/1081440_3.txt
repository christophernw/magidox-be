In the 20's the USA tried Isolationism and it did help the situation that resulted in WWII.  BUT, it was also because the US got tired of constantly dealing with the world's problems.. . Once again, we are at the extreme opposite of isolationism.  I for one am not as concerned about those other countries as I am about my own.  I would much prefer to have a good justification for MY people being killed in Iraq so we can "bring freedom and democracy there"??  It will NEVER happen.  So my friends die because we stuck our nose in a beehive thinking the bees would be thrilled to be freed from an oppressive regime (which it was).. . We cannot police the world and should not try.  Nor should be bury our heads in the sand.  BUT yeah, let's try to give the job to the world sometimes.  When Saddam went into Kuwait, we acted - stopped him from being able to do a Hitler.  But if the country won't deal with their leader internally, I don't think we should.. . (I am not a liberal, but am by your question's definition - maybe you can not be so over generalizing next time?)

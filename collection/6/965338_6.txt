Some differences in doctrine are: Catholics exalt Mary. pray to her, praise her, claim she remains a virgin forever.. other Christians do not exalt her, and know she was only a virgin when she concieved Jesus and had other children (the normal way) after Him.. . Catholics use idols to inspire prayer, statues, rosaries, candles dedicated to saints or specific prayers... other Christians do not... Catholics follow the Pope.. other Christians do not.... Catholics do not use only the Bible for doctrine...other Christians do (or at least try to). . The list is even longer but you get the drift.

Put an ad. in Hemmings Motor News, -- They deal with antique and collectable autos nation wide.  And there are some hotrods there too.  Buy one (and read), - available at your local "book store"  Find in auto magazines, has brown paper cover (like old paper bags were)..  Costs me around $6 at "Hasings" (book store) here!  Some of the big "chain grocery stores" have it in their magazine section (wal mart too)!

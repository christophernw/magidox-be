YES! Send me the FREE book on "Why are people so Gullible?" I enclose $29.95 for shipping and handling and will allow ten weeks for shipping before I start to worry and complain to the better business bureau.. . Better you should ask, why do people try to take advantage of others' gullibility? . . A question for you: do you think the questions on Yahoo answers are real, or are they just generated by some program for the purpose of taking a survey, or gathering information about people's illegal and/or immoral activities by tricking them into giving up their right against self-incrimination? Comments welcome.. . What are YOU doing asking questions here...?

A guy told you this... fantasies are usually unavoidable even violent ones, but I'd be very concerned if someone told me this, because the most rational people would be to ashamed to admit such an awful thought had entered their mind. Someone openly talking about it is either seeking help or about to do it...In My own opinion. I'd be speaking up right now you might just be saving his or someone else's life. nd would really want to live the rest of your life wishing you had.

Dogs were not invented, but evolved together with humans for mutual benefit. Dogs gave early warning of predators or enemies because of their keen noses and hearing. They were fed the leftovers, which meant they ate better than on their own and humans didn't have to worry about carrion-eaters like vultures and hyenas, not to mention the smell of rotting leftovers (not that there a lot of left-overs).

Maybe you used detergents lately and didn't wash your hand enough! Then, your skin was agressed and is now peeling.. The other possiblity is simply that you're changing skin as it happens all the time with more or less effects. . Don't worry (unless there are secretions) but think about moisturizing them. Lotions and creams are not only for girls' hands.

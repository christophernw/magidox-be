To me the best evidence that there is not one true religion is the vibrant existence of all the others.  When I realized how many billions of people TRULY believed other faiths I was humbled and realized how silly the whole thing was.  . . Do we all seriously think we're going up to heaven and God or St Peter will say to us all:  Ok. are you ready to find out which religion gets into heaven?  Are you ready? . . Oooo.  I'm sorry the correct answer is Mormons.  That's right, Mormons.  Thanks to everyone who played.

There was a long history of anti-semitism (jew hatred) in Europe going back at least 1,000 years. There were very few Mexicans or Puerto Ricans in Europe at the time of WWII. However Hitler didn't like Gypsies, homosexuals, Slavs, or blacks either. He thought that Germans ("Aryans") were superior to everyone else and were destined to rule the world.

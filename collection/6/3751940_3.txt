Wow, I'm very impressed such a genuine question coming from a young person,considering society. I guess just practice what we learn from the Bible. Talk to your friends about your concerns and your beliefs. Volunteer with youth organizations in your area and schools. Thank you for taking such an active role in education. What a wonderful breath of fresh air from all the other questions. God bless you!

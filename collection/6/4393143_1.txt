Beginning in the New Kingdom, Amun's divinity was enhanced by suggesting that he was an incarnation or manifestation of the ancient sun god (Re/Ra) of Heliopolis.  Amun had long been a deity associated with Thebes and already had status as a preemininent deity.  He was further associated with the sun with the addition of the epithet "eldest of the gods of the eastern sky". There is also a stela dating the reign of Amenhotep II from Luxor Temple the equation of the two gods is furthered by the beginning of hymn which says "Amun, when he rises as Harakhti" - Harakhti being yet another name of the sun god, referring to a specific incarnation of the sun god (the rising sun), and futher associated with the deity Horus.

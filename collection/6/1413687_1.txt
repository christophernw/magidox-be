I just had one today. It really depends what course you're in..but basically read through all the rules. If you see one you really don't understand, do some of the questions related to the question. If there's a review at the end of your book, do that.. . Also, you can search online. If, for example, you're in Geometry (that was a random guess) you could search (in Yahoo! of course) "Geometry final" or "geometry review". . good luck!

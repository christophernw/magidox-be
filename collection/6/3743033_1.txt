First try not to expose yourself to too much of that - follow your gut. If someone seems like an insensitive a$$hole, don't bother with them.  Secondly, remember that "taking offense" is a verb. The offense isn't created when they speak, it's done only after you reach out and take it in. DON'T! Just let that sh*t hang there in there air and do not take it in as a fact. Just do not accept that sh*t. I am sorry you've been hurt.

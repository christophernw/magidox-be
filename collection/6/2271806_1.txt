I have never heard of emigrantdirect, but I have used ING Direct for about 6 years now and have never had a problem with them.  They have a promo right now where the rate is 4.75% until 4/15/2006, after that it goes back to the regular rate of 3.8%.  They have no minimums, no fees, and always transfer money quickly and without a hassle.

white acting black is when a white person dresses in clothes that you typically see blacks wearing. I live NYC and i can pick them out quickly. They also TRY to use the same slang and even jewelry.  When I see that, two things run through my head.# Why cant they just be themselves? #2 Do they know how ridiculous it looks. This goes vice versa black acting white is just as ridiculous.

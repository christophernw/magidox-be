try not to worry about your weight, u are only young and most kids your age have a bit of wot they call 'puppy fat'. u will loose it as u get older. just eat a healthy, low fat diet and get plenty of exercise but dont deprive yourself because u are still growing. try to think about the your good points and work on those. im sure u are a great kid! best wishes.

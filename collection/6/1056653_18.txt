Butterfinger is the name of a candy bar made by Nestlé. It has a firm, orange-colored center similar in texture and taste to peanut brittle (without the peanuts), that is coated in milk chocolate. The filling has a peanut butter taste, hence the name. When eaten, it tends to crumble and then take on a peanut buttery consistency.. Butterfinger was invented by the Curtiss Candy Company of Chicago, Illinois in 1923. The company held a public contest to choose the name of the candy bar. The name is a slang term used to describe a clumsy person, often in sporting events to describe an athlete who can't hold onto the ball. As an early publicity stunt and marketing ploy, the company dropped Butterfinger and Baby Ruth candy bars from airplanes in cities across the United States which helped increase its popularity.. One of the slogans currently used to advertise the candy bar is "Break out of the ordinary!" Prior to that, Bart Simpson and other characters from The Simpsons appeared in numerous advertisements for the product from 1989 to 2001, with the slogan "Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!". Butterfinger was withdrawn from German shops due to consumer rejection when it was one of the first products to be labeled as containing genetically modified ingredients from corn.. After a series of mergers and acquisitions, the candy bar is now produced by Nestlé.

handing out the 'say no to cigarettes!' shirts to public, as if it works that way. There should be more scary videos on the state of smokers' lungs on TV. some boys i know develop other interests that will  use up their pocket money so they won't have a cent to buy cigarettes. Honestly, there's lot of ways to enjoy life, and smoking is just cutting the time u have to enable u to do so.

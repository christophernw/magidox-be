I truely hope that we are on the same page. I right now have the Testement of Truth set before me. Many things to understand and give thanks for. I also give thanks to the Light Keepers for giving us this chance to speak with true spirit. Logos is alive in all of us if we open our minds to everthing, and to go and try and live these words. This is where I am the tears of truth have already poured from my heart, now I must find a better way to practice this. . Bright Blessings

First, don't starve your dog for no reason. Take your dog to the Vet, you might want to bring a fecal sample with you. They might suggest putting your dog on a bland diet. Boiled chicken and white rice is the best, or your Vet might carry a canned product similar to that if you don't have time to cook a meal for your dog. .  My dog has all ways had a problem with soft stools, and when I know that is all it is I give him 2 Pepsid AC tablets. But before you give your dog any meds please ok it with your dog's doctor first.

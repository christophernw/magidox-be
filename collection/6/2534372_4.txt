You may not be able to prevent it but you can let them know they will be acountable for it. First you make the managment aware of the situation and that you are uncomfortable IN WRITING!. Once aware of the situation they are resonsible for correcting it. If they do nothing about it you can contact the local labor board or even osha depending on the type of hostilty you are experencing. If there has been physical contact you could even call the police. . Been through this before even a pat on the back can get someone taken away in handcuffs!

The pilgrims in the Plymouth Colony made thru all the harsh winters because of...THE AMERICAN INDIAN....wow! Isnt that wonderful?  The American Indian was the one that showed these people how to plant corn and other veggies....and then later on the white man started war with the indians to take their land....Thats what those Poor Indians got for being Neighborly

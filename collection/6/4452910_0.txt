Gandhi was a spritual leader who other leaders of the world like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. got their ideas from with the nonviolent protest. People around the world was inspired by his work that they want to take that non-violent acts into their own community/country. I guess Gandhi was an inspirational leader too.

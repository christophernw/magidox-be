My theory of the lack of relation between dinosaurs and God is that God put the dinosaur bones on Earth to test our faith in him so that he could be sure he knew who would believe in him in the event of a faith diversion. I mean, God would still be all powerful without their belief, but it would be a shame if no one were to belive in him, and thus everyone would eternally suffer.

Good vodka doesn't really taste like anything. In mixed drinks, it's the addition of other ingredients that make the drink special. Of course, there are flavored vodkas if you're interested in Lemon, etc. Good chilled or on the rocks.. . If it tastes like rubbing alcohol, it's a cheap liquor that will make you wish you've never swallowed it.

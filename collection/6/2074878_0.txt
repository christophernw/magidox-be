Okay here is the US Army field medics solution to this idiotic situation, its cheaper than the emergency room and close to some of you other suggestions. avoid the tweezers unless truly visible without any flashlight etc. use a couple drops of oil, mineral or olive preferably warm let it settle all over by laying on your opposite side for a minute or two than switch side so the ear with the cotton is facing down after five or six minute have passed your going to flush you ear canal with warm water the warmer the better but not hot se a thermometer if you have to, but don't go higher than 99 degrees. keeping bad ear facing down go over sink full of warmed water and take new baby bulb syringe, (found at any Pharmacy) they are light blue for sucking noses and ears and mouths of babies, any way squeeze and fill with warm water. slowly flush the ear with water being careful not to blast your eardrum intensely repeat until cotton comes out.  You can put as much pressure as you can stand without breaking your ear drum you will feel when it gets uncomfortable.  i hope this helps this kind of thing happens int the field and we have no ER so we have to know these types of things.

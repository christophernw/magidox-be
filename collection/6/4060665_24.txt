I was baptized and brought up Catholic, but I never really was interested in learning about it or getting really into it.  I do know that as a Catholic, you also go through your First Communion, and later on your Confirmation.  The Confirmation, if I remember, was the part where you yourself are old enough and make the decision to follow and accept the Catholic religion.  It just reaffirms what was done at Baptism, but you are speaking for yourself this time.

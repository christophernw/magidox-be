first of all, if it causes me to have a nightmare later, it was almost certainly 'violence'. Violence doesn't necessarily cause everyone to have nightmares, though. Violence is the result of extreme emotion that results in bodily injury, property damage, infringement- it's the forcing of one person or group of people upon someone (or their property) against the will of the other person.

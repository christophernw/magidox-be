I really can't add much more.  I agree with Meli (thanks for the post!) though -- there are so many misconceptions about bipolar- particularly the frequency of mood swings.. . Rapid Cycling, as she mentioned, is fairly uncommon.  To illustrate- you are described as a rapid cycler if you have more than 3 episodes a year...so it's not as "up and down and up and down etc etc" as you would think.  Each "cycle" could last a week or two.. . As I said, I can't add much more as far as symptoms go.  There are many resources online to answer that question.. . My experience sounds quite similar to Meli. Symptoms of mania (for me)- shopping, very careless w/ money, start tons of new projects, jobs around the house -- but get nothing done, talk constantly-call everyone I know!, make really impulsive decisions (sometimes risky sometimes not)- like I once chopped all my hair off and dyed it bright red, NO sleep.   It may sound fun at first, but running and running is so hard...on no sleep.  Eventually, it turns to paranoia and extreme confusion.. . Depression-harder to define for me personally because I have not had really long lasting episodes.  usually really tired, feeling helpless or weak, lowered self esteem, nightmares and anxiety, just an overall feeling of doom and worthlessness, paranoia, not feeling like myself or doing anything- it's a struggle to get any little thing done.

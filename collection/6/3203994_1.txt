you need to modify the phone jack receptacle on the tv, so that it does not break the circuit to the speakers. since the phone jack receptacle includes a break make, switch function. so you can add a hard wire between both sides of the phone jack switch function, if your not concerned about a small loss in impedance matching. but unless you add an additional switch feature, you will lose the ability to mute the sound in the tv speakers, when the headphones are plugged in.. . and i might add there are potential leathal high voltages in a tv. so do more than just turn it off to work on the inside. by unplugging or the removal of batteries, if it is a portable. and still work in the inside with due respect. since there are still capacitors that may retain a charge.

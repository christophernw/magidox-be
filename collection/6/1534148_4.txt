You're describing "mental fatigue". Your brain is gearing up for a battle with the exam. My guess is you are more artistically minded and one of those people who "don't test well" but aren't necessarily stupid. Your brain just doesn't like logic and nuts and bolts thought. Or, you simply haven't studied.. . Afterwards, you don't feel tired because of the release from stress, and mental relief you feel. Make sure your teachers/parents/professors know that you're struggling in some areas- you don't want preferrential treatment, but you're also willing to take an oral exam. Some people deal with information better verbally than written. They do this for some dyslexic kids.

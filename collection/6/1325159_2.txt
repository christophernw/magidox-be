One of the ways to make a million dollars in the next five years is to own your own business. More people have made more money by owning the place where they work than any other way.  How? By coming up with an idea! Not just any idea, rather, making something out of nothing and having it be used by millions of people.. For the fourth time I am saying; today many of the credit card machines are modem devices. A million dollar idea is to turn that machine into an IP device. Now that's an idea that can be used by millions of people each day.

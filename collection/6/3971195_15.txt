I really hope you don't want an aggressive dog.  I am sure you have a loyal dog and had you been there and he felt your life was in danger or you were hit he would have defended you even if it was to his death.  I am sure that is what you want.  Once a dog is trained to be aggressive he is not safe to be around.  My sister had bull dogs and thought they should be aggressive and thought it was funny that everyone was scared of them.  She fell and broke her hip and then her dogs were not safe around her as they know they could overpower her.  After one of the 5 attacked her she had to give them to a bull dog rescue.

Sunnis and Shhites are two groups in islam.they differ in thier beliefs regarding the descendents after PROPHET MUHAMMAD (P.B.U.H).              Sunnis say that there are no descendts after PROPHET (P.B.U.H)and shiaz viceversa and shhites believe that HAZRAT ALI (K.M.T.W) is the descendent after PROPHET(P.B.U.H) and shiaz still believe that the descendents still exist.other differences include difference in methodology of offerin prayers(NAMAAZ),keepin beard etc..              Regarding the KURDS they are a race of muslims or we may say subcaste like syed, ahmadi etc that has vastly deviated from the main subject.

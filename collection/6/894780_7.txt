It's not the priest who gives you forgiveness.. You go into the little box, and tell the priest what you did. The priest turns around and says "okay, God will forgive you, but you have to pray to him x number of times.". God already knows your sins. All the priest really does is tell you how many "hail Mary"s will make up for what you did.. . . (PS - I'm an athiest)

Absolutely they get along.  There are heaps of Kiwis that live in Australia and vice versa (although more kiwis in Oz). . We just like to give each other a good ribbing!. . Q.  How can you tell when a Kiwi has been in your fridge?. A.  There are love bites on the lamb roast. . See what I mean.....we love our Antipodean friends.....but they must be punished!

For one, many of them had Post Tramadic Stress Disorder, a disease not taken seriously up until this war to be quite frank, and were so paranoid, or so spaced out they would scare off any help, or the people trying to help them had no idea how serious this disease was.. Second, many of them had drug addictions, thanks to good old uncle sam who tested new halucinegens out on many of the troops.. and 3rd, many of the soldiers were pressured into performing horrendus acts of violence against civilians (unfortunatly as they do now) and the citizens did not have the paranoia of the vietnameese as the citizens of today have of the iraqies. If the entire society hates the enemy, then the majority of society will be supportive of the troops fighting them. You also have to remember, alot of the troops who went to vietnam were either drafted, or were given a choice of military service or prison, and were not at all happy about fighting for this country, and did everything they could to upset the situation even more.

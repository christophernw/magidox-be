I have found that eating 6 smaller, healthy meals a day instead of the normal 3 (breakfast, lunch & dinner) helped my metabolism a lot.  I usually eat about every 3 hours.  It lets your body know it will be fed again soon so it can release quicker - when you don't eat as often, your body stores fat in fear of not getting more.  Once your body gets used to it you will start noticing the change.  I learned that from a book by Bill Phillips called "Body for Life".  I don't follow everything in the book but the 6 meals a day really helped me.  Good luck!

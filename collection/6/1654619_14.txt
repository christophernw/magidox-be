IRAQ HAD weapons of mass destruction.  Russia flew them out to Syria just days before the Coalition moved in.  Getting rid of Sodamn Insane was just an added benefit.  Now, getting the country free of Islamist terrorists is the next step.  I have spoke to men and women who were over in Iraq.  The Iraqi people actually love Americans and ARE grateful for being rid of Sodamn Insane, except for the Soonies who lost power.

But yet you are proud of a country that was founded by the same kind of people that they are?Let me chance that "FOUNDED" to stolen.. Let me set you straight about something.My people were here when ,Your ancestor immigrants arrived.Before long they killed stole and screwed my people out of their land.They said they had the right to do so because,we were not civilized.But,they were the ones who killed,raped,and stole.. The true "illegals" in this country is the families of the ancestor immigrants.In your bible you read the words that "you reap what you sow"     So in other words what your ancestors have done to my ancestors,will be done again but,this time it will be done to YOU!!!!!!

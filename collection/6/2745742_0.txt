Salt water fish live in the sea.  There is constant circulation and waste management naturally.  Fish in tanks live in what is called a stagnant pool.  You have to reproduce the environment that replenishes oxygen, carries away waste, and prevents stagnation.. . If you want a low maintenance fish, get a bottom feeder.  I have one that I suspect I'll have to take out and shoot on judgment day.

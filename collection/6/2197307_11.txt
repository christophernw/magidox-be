Clean your carpet very thorouhly using a professional-type carpet washer.  If its possib le, take it up and clean the back too, as cat urine soaks through like any other liquid.  If you cant do that,make up a mixture of Ariel washing powder, about one scoop to each pint of hot water, and make sure it has absolutely all dissolved.  Clean your carpet with this instead of the usual basic carpet cleaner fluid..  Let it dry through completely, then  g ive it a really thorough vacuum cleaning, and this should do the job.  Spraying the carpet afterwards with Febreze should  help, too.

Kerry's comment wasn't supposed to be directed at the intelligence level of the troops. It was directed at the booger pickin' moron that's occupying our whitehouse.. . I did not like his comment as much as you.   The sad part is that it's true.. . Generally speaking, if your lucky enough to be born wealthy or at least have the type of homelife that gives you the luxury of two parents and a structured study regimen,  your going to be able to weasel out of serving your country (if you so desire).  The majority of the guys who are really getting shot at are high school grads or less.   . I'm sure there's no shortage of educated military dudes but I'm equally as sure that their "lillie white" butts are very far away from any real danger.   Just look to see how many officers have been hit  so far.. . My grandson is in Kuwait right now.  He's a high school grad who had a "swell" job installing car stereos before he got his girlfriend pregnant.   He was "bangin' down the big bucks"!  Minimum wage and lucky to get forty hours a week.   . . He enlisted nine years ago and thankfully the USN sent him to a non-combative assignment. For this we are relieved.   . . But everyday, we read about the guys who weren't so lucky.  And there are far too many of them.   . . Iraq has started to tell our troops what to do and our president when he will be allowed to withdraw our troops.   Our president, being the oilwhore that he is, is laying down and doing the bidding of Iraq's "new Saddam".    . . I'm totally ashamed of our whitehouse and the Bush administration's destruction of our national inegrity.

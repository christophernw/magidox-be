Ummmm...if by "Hydro" you mean water, it does not shock anything(bird,man,etc.). If you live in some jacked-up country where they call their electrical lines and wires hydro, and birds are "sitting" on them, you need to move. Here in America our birds "stand" on our power lines using and are not shocked because they do not complete an electrical circut.

Under the 1976 'evidence' act, the evidence of your crime has to be produced to you or your solicitor 7 days before the decision of the court is made... its something like that, it was in the news a couple of weeks ago, check back issues...basically coz they say you were speeding therefore pay up, it's wrong, they should produce evidence of you speeding then wait seven days and say pay up....

Without cracking them, place them in a small bowl of water.  I they float they are bad; if they sink to the bottom but stand up they are touch and go and could be used in a cake but if they sink and lie down they are fine.. . Works every time.  I had tried it on borderline (date wise) eggs and been surprised to find they have gone off.

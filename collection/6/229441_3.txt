dude, you are going to get yourself killed.  if you want to try it(which I seriously recommend that you don't), gradually heat your ethanol and gasoline mix.  the gasoline is more volatile so it will evaporate first.  the stuff that is left should be mostly ethanol.  but don't do that, because there is still going to be some gasoline in it and you are going to poison yourself.

Don't paint yourself in a corner.  There's nothing you can do.  Tell them.  Tell them they;ve won.  They can go home and tell their parents how cool they were by refusing to do what the teacher said.  That story'll be good every time they tell it even when they're thirty and still living with mommy and daddy because they didn't even make it through high school which really any moron can do.

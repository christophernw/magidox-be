Yes, I was, and it resulted in numerous problems:  depression, anxiety disorder, & borderline personality disorder (of which a major symptom is self-mutilation, such as "cutting," though I chose bashing my head against a wall over cutting & began showing this symptom at age 4, the first time I was abused).  I am now 25 & have attempted suicide numerous times in my life, but have not done so in the last year & a half.  I am on an anti-depressant which is supposed to also help with the anxiety, and am learning how to retrain myself to deal with the BPD, as I cannot afford "real" cognitive behavioral therapy.

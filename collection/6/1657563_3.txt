in order to replace a factory speaker with an identical speaker all you have to do is remove the speaker trim panel.  unscrew the speaker from it's mount.  unplug the harness at the back, then replace the speaker with the new one.  . . if you are adding a subwoofer, you will have run a signal cable from your head unit to an amp.  then you will connect speaker wire from the amp to the positive and negative terminals of your speaker.

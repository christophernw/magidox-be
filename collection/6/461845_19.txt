Honestly, I think the tradition of putting a person's title on an envelope, if it's a friend, is a little outmoded.  I prefer just to use the person's first name and last name without a title.  And my friends usually address letters to me that way.  If somebody did put a title, I would prefer "Ms."  . . (I am single, by the way, never married.  I prefer "Ms." to "Miss" because "Miss" seems to have lower status these days.  "Ms." is taken a little more seriously.  In my part of the country, it's widely used by single women, not just divorcees.)

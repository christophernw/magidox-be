the term mono comes from "monodic" which means one line of sound.. Mono usually uses the same "stream" to give out all the different layers of sound.. (you have all layers of sound coming from the same place). Stereo breaks up the sound into different groups of these layers and uses a different "stream" for each group.. (you could have the lows comming from one side and the highs from the other side)

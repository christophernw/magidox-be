I have a Boston and she does not stink. I bath her with a sensitive skin Oatmeal shampoo by Hartz.  That has always worked.  She never had any dander.  I think it is the oatmeal that might be helping.  They need to make sure to wash the dogs face as well...if not while bathing (in case of soap in the bulgy eyes) then get them to get pre-moistened pet wipes so they can wipe the crevices, around the eyes and ears.. Farting on the other hand is another issue.  Bostons are prone to flatulence..and mine farts all the time when given a treat or something other than her kibble.

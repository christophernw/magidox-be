i'm going to make it a point to only tip 10% from now on because of your complaining, you think your the only one in the world who works hard for their money, also many people are affected by the economy, utilities and gas prices are high, if your so worried about how much people tip i suggest you get yourself an education and find a more dependable job, and remember-HOSPITALITY is a 2-way street, and lately it seems like i've had nothing but bad waiters/waitresses

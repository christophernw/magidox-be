I expect stocks to be flat or trending down until mid- to late October.  Summer season is bad for stocks unless economic trends are highly positive, and for now we're caught in a cross-fire of inflationary pressures and rising interest rates.  The only way I can see a real turnaround before then is if the Fed clearly stops raising rates.

Photometry can mean several things. On the most basic level it means "Light measurement" (photo = light, metros = measure. in Greek), though most frequently it means the measurement of light INTENSITY. A photometer can be used, for example to check whether you have enough lighting in your reading area (so you don't damage your eyes!), or for several other things. It can also be used to measure the amount of light absorbed by things, by comparing the amount of light shone onto something with the amount that passes through. Different things will absorb different amounts of light and different wavelengths of light, which we perceive as colours.. .. Photometry is frequently used in chemistry and biochemistry, to calculate the concentration of chemicals, proteins or cells in a solution, or to determine their composition. . Some work by passing a beam of light (often visible or UV light) trough the sample in a cuvette, onto a receptor on the other side, which tells you how much light has passed through. By comparing the light passed through the sample with that of other solutions of known concentrations, you can figure out the concentration of the sample.. .. Also, infrared light photometry is used to determine the nature of organic chemicals. In this case, pure compounds need to be used, and by graphing the amount light absorbed by the samples versus the wavelength of light at which it was absorbed. This graph is called the IR spectrum of the compound, and can be used to discover the nature of the compound.. .. Usually, smaller wavelengths than infrared, or larger wavelengths than ultraviolet aren't very useful for photometry, at least in chemistry, but it is possible to detect microwaves or radio-waves as light, too.

Pair bonding for one thing.  Mating is the principle purpose, but sex also is an incentive for the formation of a primary social unit in a cooperative effort to find food and shelter, with or without the prospect of adding children to the unit.  It  of course, offers and affords pleasure as an incentive to cement the bonding process.. . Of course the prospect of pleasure during sex can adversely affect the bond if at some point the event of that pleasure seems more promising outside the bond.. . But such it is with all aspects of animal and human society.

Companies issue shares because they need capital. Shares represent a fraction ownership in the company. If investors think ta share is undervalued they buy the share to sell them at a higher price (when more people have realized the true value of the company).. Now there are factors e.g. interest rates which make the whole stock market move. Higher interest rates e.g. make borrowing money for companies more expensive,  profits are less hence stock prices go down.

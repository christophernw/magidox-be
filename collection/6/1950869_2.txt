Freedom of speech is guaranteed by the constitution which means that govt cannot stop it unless it has an overriding reason.. (can't yell fire in a crowded theatre, the govt's overriding concern is that people would panic and some would get hurt).. . Govt. isn't supposed to stop free speech just because someone is offended (getting called a name or a tasteless joke etc.) and since there are some people who love to hate, their right to their opinion also has to be protected.  SO, freedom of speech does mean that the govt cannot restrict those things without an overriding concern.. . BUT, that does not mean there is NO solution.  harassment, depending on where & how can result in civil law suits where the govt has nothing to do with it. (slander, libel etc.).. . SO, unless there is an overriding govt interest, EVERYTHING is covered by freedom of speech when it comes to the govt shutting someone up, but does NOT give anyone carte blanche to say ANYTHING without ANY repurcussions.

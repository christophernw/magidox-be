Check the pads on his paw to make sure that he didn't step on any glass or anything else sharp, if there is something there remove it...if he'll let you.. If you don't see anything and he seems to be in pain, or if his behaviour changes in any way the best thing you can do for him is take him to the Vet.. . But, DO NOT give your cat over the counter pain medication made for Humans...it is deadly to cats.

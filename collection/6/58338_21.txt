I believe in God and have a reason I use for this.. (1) If their is a God (and their is) you have lost nothing when your time comes, "If you believe in him" . I would choose to believe, then when you  get to the end of the road, and find out that everlasting life was so easy. And was unable to go back and change it...Then I would be thrown into that FIREY PIT for ever...read John 3:16-21

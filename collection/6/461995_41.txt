90 minutes is a very long sermon. Most people do not eat before church, rather thay wait until after and go out as a family. They are probably hungry and that cannot help when you are there for 90 minutes. If I may suggest, cut it down to a main sermon and then have an optional workshop after that for those who wish to stay and hear the word. I am impressed that you take the time to really try and make a difference. I wish you much success!

Housecats CAN and will find ways to get out, they can run out while you have the door open or claw through the window screens, etc. etc. When a cat is in heat it's very annoying anyway, and she will want to get out. I had a cat once who clawed through the screen and came back the next day. Later on...ta da! Kittens!

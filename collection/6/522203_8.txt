just please don't say "i'm sorry " after my mom died people were always saying i'm sorry i wanted to tell them, bitch get the fuck out my face with that shit you know damn well it aint your faulT. then they would also say if there is anything i can do let me know, they don't mean that shit i guess those are just words of comfort

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror. . Basically, mirrors are made of materials (some type of metal, aluminuum, etc...) that have the property of being able to reflect light. Unlike glass, which transmits light through itself, mirrors reflect it, therefore you see the image of the light bouncing off yourself, or whatever object you're looking at in the mirror.

Ford, as stated above, perfected the assembly line as a method of manufacturing cars inexpensively so the masses could afford to buy them.  He also paid his workers a very good wage for the time, so they, again, could afford to buy cars, homes, and travel out of the cities into the country, (a favorite activity of Ford's).

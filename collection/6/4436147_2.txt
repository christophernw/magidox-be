It's a law of science.  It will not be broken.  Of course other laws can supercede its effects, like the law of inertia.  After all, we do have rockets and they have left the earth and travelled to other planets - and even out of the solar system.. . Things are attracted to each other by gravity.  That is as sure as the fact that the sun rises in the east each morning.. . Gravity is considered a "weak" force.  There are other forces which are stronger than gravity.  So, the net force acting on an object might be more greatly influenced by something else rather than gravity.

You could maybe ask her to break it up a bit.  Stick to the stuff that deals with the food you're about to eat ("nourish our bodies and minds" or "give us strength") and then she can pray for all the people she wants to pray for when she goes to bed.  I'm figuring that if she wants to pray that much, she prays at night before she sleeps so she could just incorporate the other stuff then.  My grandfather would always pray for "travelling mercies" for those of us who had to drive a couple of hours when we prayed at dinner but other than that, it was about thanking God for the food.

Static electricity is usually caused when certain materials are rubbed against each other, like wool on plastic or the soles of your shoes on the carpet. The process causes electrons to be pulled from the surface of one material and relocated on the surface of the other material.. . The material that loses electrons ends up with an excess of positive (+) charges. The material that gains electrons ends up an excess of negative (-) charges on its surface.Rubbing certain materials together can cause the buildup of electrical charges on the surfaces. Opposite charges attract and same charges repel. Either charge will be attracted to something of neutral charge. Sparks are an extreme case of electrons being attracted to an object that has a positive charge.

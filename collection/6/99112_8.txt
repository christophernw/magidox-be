This can be the result of what you think others will think of you. You may be afraid to speak, and you might be ashamed of what you say.. . I used to be that way until my mentor was like, "Forget them dude! What do they know anyways? Be bold! Be courageous! Be what a man should be! Don't let others kick you of the picture simply because you're afraid of what they'll think of you.". . It's a hard change but don't let shyness control you. Be who are you and say what you mean.

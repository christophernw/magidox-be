i find that taking 2000 mg of llysine the first day, 1000 mg the second day, and 2000 mg again the third day gets rid of them in about 4 days. during those 4 days i use some topical ointment like zilactin. aveeno just came out with something for cold sores too, i love aveeno lotion, so i'm sure their cold sore treatment works.

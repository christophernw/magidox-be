Correction - it's the English who seem to dislike the French (probably because of ancient disputes over land between the monarchs of the two countries which kept them at war, off and on, for hundreds of years). Scotland and France have been part of "The Auld Alliance" for many hundreds of years and similarly, Ireland and France have historic ties. But anti-French sentiment is most strongly rooted in the towns of the South Coast of England, where generations of men went to sea to fight France (and Spain).. Ultimately tho, land, money and power are at the root of it all and he antipathy between the Crowns of England and France has a lot to answer for.

There are now groups that are prepared to handle these situations to care for the people. I know our city has had a lot of classes and training for emergency response so that counselors, meds, and anyone that can do something useful can help out.  Then on the national level they will go take care of the terrorists that were so chicken they had to discreetly harm innocent citizens.  And i doubt it would go unclaimed because terrorist like to get their glory.

Objects orbit one another because they have a curved trajectory that results from the vector addition of their momentum (in the direction of travel, tangential to the orbit) and the gravitational attraction to the other object (normal to the orbit).. . This vector is constantly changing in direction (but not to any significant degree in magnitude) because of the object's motion, but it always keeps the satellite's acceleration pointed towards the object is it orbiting, resulting in smooth, roughly circular motion.

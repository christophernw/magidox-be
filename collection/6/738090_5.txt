I disagree with those who have said burn in hell, they are just ignorant jersk. Now to your question. Do you feel that way because you want to follow your brother or you have had these feelings? Second if it is true feelings maybe you should wait until you can  move out on your own, and then tell your parents, judgin gfrom your mom's response she might force you to see a psychiatrist, but at 18 years of age, she can not do that. . But maybe you should seek advice from a netural party, maybe you should speak with a therapist about how you feel and how to approach your parents. . . Just remember that you do what makes you happy, if you want to be with someone of the same sex so be it, if you choose to be with someone of the opposite ses so be it.

Wake up earlier every morning so that you are absolutely exhausted each night. Try lighting some lavender incense so that you relax and your thoughts stop racing, if all else fails try reading a really boring book with the lights low, this will tire your thoughts and your eyes pretty quickly. Good luck and pleasant dreams.(I hope)

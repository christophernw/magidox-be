Probably because they're skin is more sensitive. Also  maybe because their bodies have yet to pick up an immunity to whatever is causing the outbreaks. I have 3 children, and 2 of them had bad eczema as children but they outgrew it. I really think it has alot to do with what's in their food. I use to put MSG in almost all my cooking, I seen something about it on TV and quit using it altogether which made the kids skin a little better but I would occasionally give them canned pasta or some such thing and this also has MSG in it, a lot of things actually do. Their skin was still prone to outbreaks. I mentioned this to my doctor at the time and he said there's no such thing as an allergy to MSG but nowadays they say different.

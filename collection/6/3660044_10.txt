To drink, the Belgians often enjoy coffee, hot chocolate, water, or fresh juice with breakfast. . France. In France a typical domestic breakfast will consist of bowls (rather than cups or mugs) of coffee, often café au lait, or hot chocolate with tartines — slices of baguette spread with jam — to be dunked. Croissants are also traditional. . Greece. In Northern Greece a pastry called bugatsa is eaten with Greek coffee. . Italy. The traditional breakfast in Italy is simply Caffè e latte (hot coffee with milk) with bread or rolls, butter, and jam — known as prima colazione. Biscotti (a cookie-like hard bread) is commonly eaten. Children drink hot chocolate, plain milk, or hot milk with very little coffee. If you have your breakfast in a bar (coffee shop) it is made of cappuccino e brioche (frothed hot milk with coffee, and a pastry). It is very common for Italians to have a quick breakfast snack during the morning (typically a panino, or bread roll). . Spain. In Spain the traditional breakfast is chocolate y churros — hot chocolate with Spanish-style fritters, which are extruded sticks of doughnut-like dough with a star-shaped profile covered in sugar. The chocolate drink is made very thick and sweet. In Madrid, churros are somewhat smaller and shaped like a charity ribbon. This meal is normally served in cafeterias, but at home it is more common for breakfast to be a cup of coffee and olive oil or butter toasts, buns or a Spanish bread sandwich, commonly ham and cheese. . .

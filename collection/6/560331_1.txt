Guadalajara has continental climate. At this time of year it will be warm and dry, as summer is starting, very rarely windy. When I go, I usually make sure I have a good sunblock protector, cotton Tshirts and a light jacket, as evenings get a little cold (specially considering all the overheating of day light). I prefer long trusers because of insects but short trousers or skirts could be used perfectly, right now they have 32 grades centigrade, on day light (confirmed first hand not a weather web page).

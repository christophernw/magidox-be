I think a NINE TRILLION DOLLAR national debt, including the 3 largest annual budget deficits (all authored by Bush and his lackies in Congress) is pretty evil. Why can't the so-called "conservatives" of the Republican Party manage a balanced budget like Clinton did? The best they could do was vote recently to raise the ceiling on the national debt.. . ps: NINE TRILLION DOLLARS equals $30,000 apiece for each American.

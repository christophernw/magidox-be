My brother's dog (Who is on a run-line) Red Rovered me and tripped me from behind, and I landed smack on my tailbone.. . . Walk gingerly. Be careful how you sit (The inflatable doughnut does help).. . . I took Three Aleve in the morning, and it helped ease the pain greatly. Good luck, feel better soon. It took me about a month to completely heal, and all I was is bruised.

To make a hangover less, drink alto of water before you go to bed... But getting back to your question Thursday night, I might of had one or two, to many... I do love Bourbon so much... I only felt a little seedy(sick) next day... Luck I had Friday off... Thank God for Good Friday.... . If I drink alot I anyway have Subway the next day... It does help...

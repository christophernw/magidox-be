The best idea would to sit down with a broker and discuss the investment with them. It is also important to note that the company might be selling items at $3000 and they are selling like hotcakes, what is thier markup? If they have a little mark-up (like 2%), it could be better to invest in a company that sells cheaper items, with a higher mark-up and greater volume then the company in question.. . I'm glad you are looking at numbers and sales, but please keep in mind there is a lot of different information that goes into a stock price and their performance in the future.

Of course there's a reason for it!. . Marketing and promotional work.  Harry Potter (and many others) spend millions to promote their books.  And getting your book mention in a magazine or show (Opra will automatically get your book on the best seller list, and I'm not joking).. . Niche writing.  As a rule Nonfiction books sell better than fiction.  Why?  Because more people like nonfiction than fiction.  (Ask about this if you want to know more).. . Good writing.  Plain and simple.  While both of the previous areas will send a book to many readers its breaking through to people who usually DON'T read is where the big bucks lay.  Having a really great written book is the key to this.. . Hope this helps!

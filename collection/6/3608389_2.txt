Well, Speed Racer,.          You didn't say what kind of car,  you're doing this to.  The cars I drove back in the 60's and 70's were pretty tuff, guess that's one of the reasons they were called "Muscle Cars".  What you describe is harder on the power train/ drive train then the clutch itself, slipping the clutch causes more wear.. .                    Ps. It's     " Dumping the clutch" not dropping.

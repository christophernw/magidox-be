dudue take this seriuosly "you'er detoriating!". ok just kidding,you shed dead cells evryday (yes cell are to small to see), here's the catch sometimes our skin just peels as an new layer takes it's place, so hurray you got new skin! ok that was too hype but it's normal, it could be that or an alergic reaction to detergent, dishwashing liquid or any thing, but if it doesn't hurt, itch or bleed then there's nothing to worry about

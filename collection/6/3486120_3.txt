even if famous ppl/stars choose not to be parents,i think they should focus on the agencies that are trying to help abused/neglected children. too many agencies have had the right idea,and there heart in the right spot,the $$ was not there. even every day ppl have a platform,something they believe in and support,but when did trees and animals take 1st place over human life? robin

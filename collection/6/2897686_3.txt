I read its an automatic reaction left over from when humans were still evolving as a species, prior even to caveman days.  Early humans would laugh (sort of) when they encountered something new and strange.  It was a way of telling others that what they had found was not dangerous and that there was nothing to fear. Supposedly, this instinctual behaviour evolved into modern laughter.

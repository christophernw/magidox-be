Depends upon your age, your current state of health, your previous health, your muscular health, your general diet. Fibre can bloat your belly though that does not mix with the constipation.. Is your period due?. I would recommend a programme of healthy detoxing with a review of your current exercise regime- check with doctor first, though please do not think you are going to find a miracle cure because you won't.

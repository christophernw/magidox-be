Architecture has progressed alot. Before, we used to live in houses that fell down easily everything used to be made out of stuff that would fall down from a small hurricane....and we have buildings that are super tall yet can stand up from a hurricane and can now withstand fire (special ceramics for that) electricity too, helped make this come true.

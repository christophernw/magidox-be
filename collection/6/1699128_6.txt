lol. hey bro. you sound like you have been brainwashed by the self rigtheousness of the catholic church. if there is a god(which there is) then he is the one who made sex feel so good, right? it isnt jsut for procreation but for affection and enjoyment. the bible says concerning husbands and wives, "do not deprive yourselves" the cathloics were trying to make themselves rigtheous by there deeds. dont get me wrong I am not hammering catholics but there are many people from that denomination that have NO IDEA what the bible is all about. i dont care who you are, you let christ into your life and he WILL change you, you will have made the greatest decision of your life.. Jesus said "I came that they may have life, and that more abundantly. God isnt just waiting for you to do wrong so he can throw thunderbolts at you. He isnt worried about you ahving a good time. god isnt about bringing you down he is about building you up!!!!! it is about being a champion and overcoming the garbage we face in our lives, and standing tall in what christ did for us. " whosoever shall call upon the name of the lrod shall be saved"!!! call he's wating for you.

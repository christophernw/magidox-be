South Park reason - to make "it" look bigger.. . Biblical reason - Circumcision was a sign of God's covenant, that the Jews might be circumcised, and the Gentiles (non-Jews) be "filthy" essentially. The Jews had tons of religious laws, one even legislated how you have to clean the bedsheets if you have a naughty dream and soil the bed. When the Jews were attempting to bring the Gospel of Christ to the Gentiles, who did not follow Jewish custom, they decided that circumcision or not does not matter, and that Gentiles don't have to follow all the Jewish custom.

My Mom and Dad almost starved to death when Hoover was President.  It was just like it is now- no jobs, they could not afford gas, and my mom's dad would work all day on the railroad for just a bag of sugar or flour.  They ate a lot of thing out of the woods like dandelion greens, etc.  President Roosevelt brought the country out of the depression and people began to have food and the other things they needed.  Hoover was for the rich and President Roosevelt was for the poor.

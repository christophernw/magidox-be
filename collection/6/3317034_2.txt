Until about 100 years ago, life expectancy at birth [royalty included] was of little more than 40 years. In medieval times, it was even lower, due to widespread poor hygiene, contaminated water and food, and overabundance of disease-carrying animals like rats. Even medical doctors, nurses and midwives didn't have an idea that such a simple thing as hand washing before treating patients made a big difference in cross-contamination, disease and death rates.

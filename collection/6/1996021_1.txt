the team wins just depend on the final score, the pitchers win depends on his role in that victory. If a pitcher pitches 8 innings and the score is tied 1 to 1 and another pitcher comes on in relief the starter is not responsible for the win or loss. if they are up 2-1 and they end up winning He gets the win and the relief P gets the save. If they lose that game the starter gets nothing and the relief P gets the loss

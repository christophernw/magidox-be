The water on earth goes through a cycle when it first exists as vapor in the atmosphere, then, when weather conditions are favorable, it condensates and form clouds which then in turn "break" apart in the form of rain drops.  The liquid water on earth flows in rivers, forms lakes and oceans and eventually becomes either frozen in the ice of the poles or evaporates to form more clouds.

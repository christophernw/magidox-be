I am the adoptive mama to 2 daughters from China. I belive it is VERY ethical and Biblical to adopt..  In James, Jesus even tells us this.  "Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of God is this, to care for orphans and widows in their afflictions".   I have many friends who have adopted and had bio children. They have wonderful blended families and would adopt again without hesitation.

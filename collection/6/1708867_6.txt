it depends what kind of locker it is. If its a combination lock, can't help ya there, but if its a key lock, get a thick piece of paper, but not too thick, or else it won't fit, or get one of those fake Credit Cards or Something, and Swipe it down the locker, and it should unlock it...  do it fast though

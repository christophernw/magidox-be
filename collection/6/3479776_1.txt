rockman's answer is appealing from our reality but wrong. The analogy about inertia and centripetal force is not correct if you really want to know. (It was good enough for me in 7th grade but it depends on your audience). The problem is that classical mechanics (Newtonian physics) does not work at the electron level. New rules apply there.. . The classical problem (and this provided a great deal of debate at the turn of the cenury) is that if an electron is moving like that and continually changing direction in a orbit around the nucleus, it must be accelerating. If a particle accelerates, it has to emit energy. Eventually it will lose energy and then crash into the nucleus.. . Protons and electrons do attract each other, but electrons act as waves and particles because they exist as a diffuse region where the electron is 90% of the time ... in an orbital. And different orbitals have different energies. So it can't just slowly fall to a lower orbital, It's an all or nothing process.

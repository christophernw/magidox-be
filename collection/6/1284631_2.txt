The speed of sound is approximately 760 mph.  When an aircraft approaches this speed sound waves build up on the leading edges of the wings.  When the aircraft exceeds the speed of sound then those sound waves are pushed out of place and travel down the aircraft to the tail where they snap back into place.  A sonic boom is actually two sonic booms only milliseconds apart.  The first is when the waves first are displaced the second is when they snap back into position.

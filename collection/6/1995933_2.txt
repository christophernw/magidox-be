Higher value is a subjective term.  They are higher vs the US $ now than they were a few years ago.  So are a lot of other currencies, as the US $ has been losing value relative to most world currencies.  This has to do with money moving out of the country - out of US investments (our stock market went down) and out of Treasury bonds (the Feds have held the interest rate at close to zero for so long.)  . . People buy stocks, bonds, and currency investments when they think the money is a good value.  Since the Feds started raising the interest rates, more people are investing in US dollars, stocks and bonds and our dollar value is increasing.. . It also has to do with balance of trade - when we buy more (import) than we sell (export), we pay out more dollars than we take in (especially true with China in recent years) and our dollar value goes down.

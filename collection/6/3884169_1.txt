Visit on Sunday ;-). But if you really want to be more proactive, I suggest talking to the pastor - make an appt, just to let him know where you are and to see if the church is a good fit for you. Share what you shared online and what you want for yourself in this "new" direction. Confession is a very healing thing. It's unfortunate that [protestant] churches in general don't do more of it. Get someone to be on your side to walk along with you. Remember, you're not alone.

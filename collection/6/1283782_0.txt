They may be identical or quite different - the title does not distinguish them so much as their own interest and personal experience.  Family Medicine traditionally includes more pediatrics and well visits while Internal Medicine traditionally includes more geriatrics and chronic disease - as well as 'mystery' problems - those which are not easily diagnosed.  Both are basically Primary Care Physicians.  I am boarded in Family but practice Internal Medicine.

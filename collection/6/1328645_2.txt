You can find a broad explanation in Wikipedia. But if you need a quick answer here is one:. A "counsellor" can listen to you and give some general advice about which other professionals you might see. But a counsellor can not give you judgements about your original problem or can not analyse your problem. He or she helps you to define what the possible nature or name(s) of your problem could or cold not be , namely a broad picture of your problem. . A "counsellor psychologist" is an expert who do counselling in the area of psychology. Because counselling is a guidance which could be in many different areas, such as business counsellor, family, education, real estate and you name it. . Those who have expertise in a certain area could be a counsellor, but this is restricted with the general picture, and with the subject area. . For instance a counselling psychologist can tell that a problem is related with psychology or not, and if it is, can advise that which steps could be taken (what type of specialist should be seen), but cannot suggest a solution. Also a counselling psychologist cannot make counselling (cannot "sell" anything if you like) about computers, education or business, unless he or she has a counselling experience in these areas as well as psychology.

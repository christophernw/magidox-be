I'm a third year law student. The reason is because you have to go through discovery. This takes time, money, deliberation, etc. Believe me...if you got a fast med mal case you would NOT win and neither would you be happy! Med mal cases are VERY complicated because lawyers have to take medical information, learn it in depth (remember, most of us went to law school because we don't like science) and then try to convey what they are trying to say to a a lay juror who also didn't go to medical school. There is a lot learning in the process. ONe doctor will say one thing and one another so the lawyer has to cover all basis. BUT I will admit that some lawyers use "delay tactics" in order to buy more time but if you were that lawyer's client, you probably would appreciate that tactic if it would win your case. End point? Be patient. If you have a claim, it will pay off in the long run. Lawyers are trying to cross all ts and dot all "i"s--otherwise you could turn around and sue them for legal malpractice because they DIDN'T do something that would have cost more time. Think about it.

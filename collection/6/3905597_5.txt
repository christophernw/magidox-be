Well, first of all, it doesn't smell like dead humans. It smells that way because it has been sitting in your intestines for a day or two. Think of it as garbage. If you have it in your house for a while, it starts to stink. This is off subject, but how do you know what dead bodies smell like? WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING??!!!

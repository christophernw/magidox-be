I dont think there really is a good way to test your water pump.  My water pump went out during a trip to phoenix... first my friend and I heard this awfull squealing sound (the belt) by the time we got off the highway the belt was gone and the truck started sounding better... but when a mechanic came out to put a new belt on he noticed that my water pump wasnt moving anymore.  I was lucky... I drove an older Toyota pickup so the actual pump only cost about $27.  While the water pump was broken my truck still ran... we had to drive it to the mechanic.  But it was near over heating in about 10 mins.

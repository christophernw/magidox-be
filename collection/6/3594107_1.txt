Really. They/Their are plural.  Too many people don't like to be corrected.  I find it to be helpful.  You're not insulting anyone, just bettering their (I mean, one's) grammar.  Another sample I wish people would learn: Mrs. Jones' diary, not Mrs. Jones's diary.. The group and its members, not the group and it's members.. . Good luck!

PROTECTIVE job of iris muscle to make pupil hole smaller is called CONSTRICTION, and it is designed to keep too strong or too much light from entering the eye.  . . DILATION of pupil hole or iris muscles helps to let maximum light entering.. . All this happens due to light, yes, but these same iris muscle reactions that change the pupil diameter can happen as a result of the fight-flight mechnism (dilation during more stress and epinephrin-adrenalin)  or during drugs. Pot, belladona  (usually eye drops) and cocaine can all make iris muscle respond, the pupil hole dilate.

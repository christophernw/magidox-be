It sounds like your aunt is dealing with her illness very well by continuing to do the things she has been doing.  I don't know how much you want to spend, but do you think she would go for a manicure and/or pedicure?  I would enjoy that.  But not at a nail salon---the smells in those places are really bad for a person's lungs, and it also might make her feel nauseated with the chemo.  A gift certificate to a regular beauty shop that does manicures would be better.. . It's hard to buy for someone who already has everything!  If you like to spend time with her, you could make a fancy page on your computer giving her a coupon for a lunch with you.  Or if you want to spend more, you could make it for dinner at a nice place.  If you don't want to spend the time with her, a gift certificate to a nice restaurant would be fine.  If she has a hobby, a gift card to a store where she could get supplies would be appreciated, I'm sure.  . . I'd try to forget the fact that she is terminal.  She is living life now and I think you should treat her as if everything is normal when it comes to the gift.  You sound like a good niece!

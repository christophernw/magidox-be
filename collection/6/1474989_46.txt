First of all I am sorry for your loss. Secondly part of you question indicated "he kills people as examples" part of your answer is that God does not kill people.Heroin killed her not God, and yes as unfair as it may be, she made that choice not God, and the fact she died when others can do heroin for years is not a provision from God, he does not say this one can be an addict forever, and this on dies on their first attempt,addicts hurt God as well I am sure,God is love and anyone loving a person would not want to see them suffer addiction.If you must blame God for her choices,then perhaps you could just presume God wanted to spare her and the others in her life her impending addiction,maybe she would not have stopped at the first time trial,is as far as saying God killed her for trying heroin, because he did not.Whenever I am faced with situations where I want to blame God and in my limited understanding cannot fathom how he could let something happen that is so painful to me, I am reminded of a scripture that helps me and hopefully will help you "Trust in the lord with all your heart,lean not on your own understanding, but acknowledge him in all ways,and he will make your path straight." This reminds me that because something occurs that seems so unfair or beyond my understanding ,and I may want to blame God, to instead rely on his understanding of the situation,and trust him to help me recover and be a better envoy for him and a better person for me.some things aren't fair but God does not choose what is fair and does not interfere with our choices,he will not alter our choice or consequence, but he will help me through, and he will help me to make better choices,Don't blame God for her demise,blame the person that gave her the dope or helped her get it and blame the people that left her thinking it was something should she give a try, they killed her not God.

zero gravity means that, no gravity at all. . . There is place where there is no gravity at all. . 1. the centre of  the earth..  why?. Because at the centre of the earth the gravtiy of the earth pulls the object from its all sides. Thats why the resultant force on the object will be zero.. . another good example is in the space where there is no gravity at all.. . a book placed on a table is also experiencing the zero gravity. Because the weight of the book acts downward while the reaction force originating from the table acts upward. Thus these two opposite and equal forces cancel each other and the resultant force will be zero.. . wish this helped

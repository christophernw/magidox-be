why should they know if ur responsible. this is horrible advice by the way.. . If you have friends, find a way to sleep over. Then find a way to say you had a sleep over but actually go clubbing, and actually sleep over.. . You'll be truthful halfway at least.. . Clubbings over-rated by the way, but if you want to waste your money that bad, then go for it. You'll probably have more fun putting that money in a savings account tho.

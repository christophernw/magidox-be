First off a person does not always die when their heart stops beating as their heart can be restarted (what defibrilators are for). But if it cannot be restarted blood stops being pumped through the body, so it cannot provide the body with O2 (oxygen). The body needs oxygen to function, so when a person's heart stops they die.

Health is a very long disease with minimal symptoms that accumulate over a lifetime and results in death. It defines what we call "life expectancy" and is the factor that limits how long humans can maximally expect to live. A life of "health" causes one to die from "natural causes" in contrast to disease which decreases the maximal life expectancy and whose processes are superimposed on those of "health" and in which there is a specific cause of death.

Never, never, never, never ever douche - it destroys your natural balance - which is VERY delicate & sensitive to small changes.  Douching was at its height in the 70's + 80's if that tells you anything.  It's widely accepted at this point that it can be more harmful than good.  We are too obsessed with hygeine - whether it's good or bad for us.  Leave the inside alone - it will take care of itself.  Your body knows how to take care of itself.  As far as the outside - never use strong soap - my Dr. recommended Dove soap - it is gentle.  The antibacterial soaps can kill the good bacteria - which can cause infection.  Use a removable shower head if you have one.

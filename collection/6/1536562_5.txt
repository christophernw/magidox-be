Well, i am also trying to precipitate gold using FeSO4, but my results were not very encouraging. The iron(ii)sulphate instead took sometime to dissolve. But I did not neutralise it cause i thought it can preipitate insoluble hydroxides, may be the chemistry teacher is correct, i just don't know. I guess we gotta do more experiments.

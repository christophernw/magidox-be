Sounds like fleas...bathe them all in DAWN DISH DETERGENT, since the youngest is 10 weeks, you cannot use a flea shampoo yet.  Make sure you spray or use flea carpet powder in your home for fleas, wash all the bedding etc.....Vaccuum really well, and immediately throw the bag away from the vaccuum because fleas can live inside the bag.  Two days after you bathe them, go to the vet and purchase a topical flea preventative, Revolution is great, or you can try frontline.  These must be applied once a month, every month for flea prevention.

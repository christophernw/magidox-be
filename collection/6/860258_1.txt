Unfold the worm (corkscrew part) completely and partly open the lever parallel to the worm. Insert the worm into the cork and begin to turn.  As the screw drives into the cork, the notch in the lever should rest on the lip of the bottle.  Keep turning until the worm is completely in the cork.  Make sure the lever is between you and the bottle, and pull back towards you gently.  Once you get the hang of it, you'll never use another fancy device again!

An education gives you freedom to choose.  You get to choose if you want to work as a garbage collector, or a teacher, or a doctor.  (Of course, you have to specialize your education for thoses choices.) An education gives you the power to make your own choices in life, instead of living with other people's leftovers.  I believe this is one of the most priceless things: power over your own life!

Depends on what you're looking for. If you want ease of care with companionship, cats are great! They are pretty easy to take care of, just clean their litter and feed them. And they are very loving despite what people say. Dogs are great if you are looking for something to take with you places and such outdoor things. They are great companions too but a little higher maintenance I think.

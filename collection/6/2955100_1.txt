Fetal development in the mothers womb has a large effect upon the scar we call the 'belly button'. Nutrition, fetal movement, mothers activities, and general health can be factors on whether our navals are formed in or out or whatever.. So, when you see that cute girl with the cute little belly button, you should know she was a beautiful baby! =)

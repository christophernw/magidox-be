There are several reasons...but the 3 most likely are these:. . 1) One gas station is closer to a highway, high traffic shopping center, or some other facility that generates more traffic, and therefore, more customers.. . 2) Even though they are the same company, they may not be owned by the same individual. There might be 2 separate owners, or perhaps one is a franchise and one is company-owned.. . 3) One has been informed of a price increase/decrease, and the other hasn't yet, or just hasn't changed prices yet.. . I live in a medium sized city (4th largest in IL) and it's not uncommon to have as much as a 4-5 cent differential in various parts of town, and cheaper yet across the river where the taxes are slightly less.. . Hope this info helped.

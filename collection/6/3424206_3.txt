I sort of understand what you're going through and may be able to explain.  The sort of people you're dealing with don't truly know you, therefore, only say that they like you.  I suggest confronting them and if they can not supply an answer, search for friends else where.  Start getting involved in group activities. That usually helps thing a lot.  It's really nothing to do with you, it's more to do with them.. . Hope that helps!

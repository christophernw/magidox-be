Because a rainbow is a  spectrum of bright gay colours and the rainbow flag represents a spectrum, the range and diversity of human sexual types. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender.. . Human sexual nature does not come as a neat black & white straight & gay polarity, each of us is unique.. . Straight people are all different to each other just as gays are all different to each other.

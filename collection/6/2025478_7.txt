I am sorry to hear about your friends circumstances. I am a Christian, and the best thing i can tell you is to pray right from you heart, Pray for peace, mercy, and grace. pray that God will be with everyone,that God will give peace that passes all understanding. But before your friends daughter passes away, find out if she is saved and if she has Jesus in her heart, because if she isnt saved and she does pass, she wont be passing to Heaven to be with Jesus, if you know what i am saying. So if possible, i would see your friends daughter and get her to agree in the salvations prayer if she is not saved. I would pray for God's will to be done in this persons life. Its sad when people leave this earth and leave us, but one thing we have to remind ourselves is everyone has a purpose on this earth to do for God and when that purpose is fullfilled then we go home to be with Jesus!

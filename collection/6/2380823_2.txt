Actually, the name of the plant is Lawsonia Inermis, or henna, from which the powder is derived. Mehndi is the term used to describe the artform that is used to apply henna paste to the skin to create a stain in the shape of a design. It is used in marriage rituals in India and other Eastern cultures, but has been adopted here in the west for decoration as well.

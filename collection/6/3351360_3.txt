even heard this question on local radio & surprized to hear mention of my special find when i was looking into major ways to look younger; tend skin* comes in a blue bottle and looks like alcohol but is a lot stronger requiring a few spot applications. it's easy to dry out the spot area your treating; be careful to follow directions.

it was just the better of the two,  God help us if Gore had been in there,  we may have surrendered to Iraq by now. . . It is not that he was a great choice but the only choice that did not mean ruin for america for sure,  both sides need to pick some real choices that want a strong america and will not sell out to self interest groups ( like both parties on immigratrion right now)

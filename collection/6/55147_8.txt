Well Hitler, wanted the master race to claim its natural born super power rights as he believed they had once done.  He thought Germans were originally from Atlantis.. . He took over parts of surrounding country's by saying "Germany is growing and we need more land, i don't want to fight So please give me some land and i will ask for no more".   Well we tried to use diplomacy and said OK.  But he would continue to do this until he had his eyes on Poland.. . Finally the world said OK they are not trying to gain needed land, they are trying to take over the world.  . . Now in the Pacific, Hitlers other half, japan, who believed they were descendants of the sun god, also wanted to take over the world.  So when the USA used sanctions to deprive them of oil, they attacked Pearl Harbor.  Then declared war on the US.. . That's pretty much how it happened.

The walk button has been a lonesome stress-relieving vestige for the weary traveler. While pushing the button a single time activates the signal that someone is waiting, and all other attempts are fruitless, the sheer relief of believing that repeated attempts will make the light change faster is a common occurrence.. . People will curse, pray, cross their fingers, punch the roof of their car, scream, tap their steering wheel, flash their headlights and do just about anything to make traffic move faster...even though none of this is effective in the slightest.. . So push the button in earnest! It at least makes the other people waiting with you feel like you are doing something to further their cause.

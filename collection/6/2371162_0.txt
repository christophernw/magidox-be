On a domestic flight you'll usually be offered free food in first class (although on a flight under 3 hours you probably will only have a choice of snacks).  Both have bigger seats than in coach.  Also, you get to board the plane first in first class, so don't have to wait in line and you don't have the issue of finding room overhead for carry-on luggage.

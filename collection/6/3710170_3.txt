Perhaps it's similar to the avoidance of the name "Voldemort" by the wizarding world in the Harry Potter series - fear.. . But Dumbledore was right (or was it Hermione?); fear of the name only increases fear of the thing itself. I think that was only in the movies, but it doesn't matter.. . Proper names should really be used in place of God, though. When you say "God," no one really knows for sure which one you're talking about, unless they only believe in one god - and even then it might be a different one than the one the author is referring to. Yahweh, Jehovah, Jealous (Exodus 34:14), Allah, Krishna, Zeus, etc. - "God" is a title, not a name. It's as disrespectful as calling someone "Hey, Mister!"

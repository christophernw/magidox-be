Getting to the casting numbers can be difficult... Really the only way to tell, but....  If you can find the numbers on either your carb/throttle body or transmission, you can go to a parts house and have them look them up.  Most of the time they can tell you if they could be put with a 350 or a 400.  That may give you the answer.  In my experience, modifications or new parts have to be bought to put a 400 into a vehicle with a factory 305 or 350 (the tranny/converter fit too tight on a 400).  They are all 8 cylinders and I think that they are all machined from the same basic form.  Maybe someone could help me out here, but doesn't a 400 require a larger oil pan than a 350?  I believe the 305/350s are small blocks and the 400s are bigblocks.  Since it came from a dirt track car, it could be a 350 bored over to a 400.  I'm assuming you don't have it torn down or you could look at the crankshaft.  Something you can also look at the 8th number in your VIN (for the engine size originally in the truck - if it's a GM) and then see if it looks like your engine mounts were modified or the exhaust manifolds look like they fit tight - not an exact answer, but it should give you an idea.

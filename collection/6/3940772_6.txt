In the original version of the story "Snow White" what happened was the evil queen dunked an apple in a magic potion to make it a shiny red and irresistable to Snow White.  When she disguised herself as an old crone and gave the apple to Snow White, a chunk of the apple lodged in Snow White's throat and she fell down as if dead.  The seven dwarves could not bear to bury such beauty so they built a glass coffin and decided one of them would always sit and watch over her on the top of a high hill.  One day, a prince came by and saw the beautiful princess.  He begged and begged the dwarves to let him have the princess in her glass coffin because he could not leave her, he was so deeply in love.  The dwarves finally consented and as they carried the coffin down the hill, one of them tripped and jiggled the coffin, dislodging the chunk of apple from Snow White's throat and she came back to life.  Snow White and the Prince decided to marry and they invited the evil Queen to the wedding.  When the evil Queen saw that the new bride was Snow White, she screamed in a fit of anger and dropped down dead.  The End.

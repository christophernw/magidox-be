In theory, you would need something that would be able to cause the nuclei of the elements in whatever you input to break apart, i.e. fission.  The difficulty is when you have lighter elements... they are more difficult to break apart, as the nuclei are more compact.. . The problem with fission is that you generally need lighter elements for that... and you can't fuse anything with a higher atomic number than iron.  Iron just won't fuse.  That's why the heavier elements are only produced in supernovae.. . The biggest problem you would face would be containing the sheer amount of energy involved... first, you would need a huge amount to get either to start, and then, the amount released would be tremendous.  Secondary would be what to do with the waste products... many might be radioactive.. . It's a big problem, and if you can figure it out, you'll be rich.. . Good luck!

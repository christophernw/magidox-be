Your credit report and crdit score are actually two very different things.. . Your report shows your history, things like how often you apply for credit, how often you've paid late, and how much money you owe in total.. . Your score is an evaluation of your creditworthiness.  It is a quantification of the most important thing from your report: timlieness of payments, how long you've had credit, etc.. . Because your score is computed from the information on your report, it would be a conflict if your score was on the report, and it would also make it difficult to keep up-to-date.

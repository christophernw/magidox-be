Ive always heard English was harder because of different dialects, slang, "proper english", etc.. Im from the South and I sound totally different from someone in Ohio or New York.  I say things with a long vowel (A) where some people use the short vowel (a) but its the same word.   . Honestly, Im not sure which is harder, but Ive always heard English.. . One of my friends I work with, Arvin, hes from Iraq.  He said English is the hardest language hes learned yet  (he speaks 3 different lang)

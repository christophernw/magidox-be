I have been having a similar prob. except that my legs swelled from the knees to the tops of my ankles itched tingled stung and if I put any pressure on them throbbed. I suspected a pair of jogging  pants dye, and evitently was right. I had forgot to wash the pants and the dye evidently was tearing me up. So check for clothes you may have bought and forgot to wash, it could be dyes or some thing you are allergic to like lemon in soap or maybe something you may have sprayed in the yard.

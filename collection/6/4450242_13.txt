It has to do with body mass and volume. Alchohol flows through one's digestive system, like any other beverage. It's contents, both good and bad, are absorbed by the body. Since women are smaller the alcholol travels the system faster. Thus, they feel the effect faster, (drunkeness) . . . Also, since a woman's body is smaller, the alchohol has less time to dilute before reaching the liver and effecting the mind. Therfore, the alchohol reaches the liver,and travels the blood in a more dense, consentrated form than it would a man.. . Physchology and hormones may also play a drastic role. Naturally, a woman's hormones cause inconsistant emotions. These drastic changes can make each mood seem more intense and overwhelming. For this reason, women may experience oppression, (or depression as most say) more frequently than men. Obviously, oppression is often an inspiration to drink.. . For these reasons, women do not only become alchoholic quicker than men, but are addicted to drugs quicker than men also.

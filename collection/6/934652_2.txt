Wash your face when you get up. Than wash your face before you go to bed.  Also if you exerciese or work around greasy food you should wash your face afterwords. . . You can't always prevent but you can redouce the number you get. Also every few years you probably have to change what kind of face wash you use. I know that I used on particular kind on my face and than after awhile it stopped working. I think my skin built up an immunity to it or my skin changed. I use this stuff by Clean and Clear. It's a blackhead scrubbing wash. It has little beads in the face wash and exfoliates my skin.

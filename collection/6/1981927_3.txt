Even when you do push ups, you are working your muscles with resistance of your body weight.  Your chest muscles will get stronger every time you do these and so will your triceps, as you work them big time when you push yourself back up again.  The muscles actually tear (this is what causes them to be sore the next day) and this is why they need 48 hrs to recover, they are healed quickly and become stronger every time this happens.  Without the 48 hr. rest period they stay torn and never quite get healed up.  A good full body workout would be Mon.Wed. & Fri. because of this, hope this helps some.........

it just depends on who you are me i have had two kids and i didnt ever figure out what all the fuss was about my sis in law labored for 36 hr my si labored for 1 hr my second one just seemed like it popped out i was watching guiding light and i was having the baby and telling them move i want to see prev of tom. the key is get the epidural when you get to a 4 if you are progressing rapidly enough but if your are slowly progressing wait till you cant wait no more  good luck girl hope it is good for you as it was 4 me

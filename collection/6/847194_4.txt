Basically you werent the owner of the stock in the first place. You have the responsibility to close the position, if its still open. Chances are that it is still open, so if it is still trading go into the market and buy it back. If you dont buy it back, there maybe a situation where the company reissues shares to past shareholders and you may have to cover that position at the new share price.

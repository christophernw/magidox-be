Beetlejuice is a revolting character from a comedy-horror movie.. . Betelgeuse, (also known as Alpha Orionis) is a highly evolved red supergiant in the Orion constellation, although it appears orange to us. It's name is derived from the Arabic "Ibt al Jauzah" (the Armpit of the Central One)!! . . Both 'beetle' names are supposed to be pronounced BE-ET-ULL. I'm not 100% sure about the 'juice' parts though!!. . So, either you are the shining star in someone's eyes, or you are the walking-corpse with a black and white stripy jacket and teeth like broken gravestones...!!!!

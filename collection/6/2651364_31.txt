I hate when that happens. Every time I go down town in Akron, Ohio, it seems all the religious nuts pick (me) to come up to and address the issue of god. I say: Just leave me the f**k alone, when and if I want god, I know where to look for (it)!!! I don't go and pick them out to rattle on about something, so leave me alone!! Oh by the way, you can't just leave gently, these a** holes are yelling, pushy, won't shut up, ask you a lot of questions real fast and literally walk you into a damn wall with all of them crowding around you talking, and preaching, So NO! I do not think you were rude! I would like to kick them in the teeth! ( the rotten dirty creeps)!!!!!!!! They literally use their chests, getting closer and closer to your face till you are up against a building! The sick bastards! That's one reason I never want to be down town, especially on a Saturday!!!!!!! What these idiots don't realize, is that (they) are the ones who are making me HATE anything about god and all that happy horse sh** !!!!! Yes! When I say: Leave me the f**k alone, I mean it! I would hate to have to stab their guts out, so don't push me too far, the stupid idiots!!! And YES, to all who will complain, I know god is suppose to be capitalized, but who gives a f**k!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's just another word!!!!!!!!!!!!!

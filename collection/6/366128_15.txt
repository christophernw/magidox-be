The point of Victorias Secret stuff is to make women FEEL sexy when they wear the stuff. If we see a sexy woman wearing it, it will make us feel more sexy when we put it on. Its not supposed to make us remember specific styles that the models had on, its just supposed to get us to mentally pair Victoria's secret products with being sexy, so when we want to be sexy, we naturally think of VS.

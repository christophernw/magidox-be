I have no basis for this opinion but.... I think is is the body's way to avoid peeing in your pants. You see, it is very difficult to pee with a hard-on, it may also close the little valve that lets urine or semen out of the bucket, you know, the reason it takes a little while to pee after you have an orgasm?

If you have just a regular Stock stereo system, the only thing you could do is but new speakers with higher watts then the ones you have now.... . If you are working with some subs and an amp or two then make sure your RCA cables are ran separatly then your remote and power wire...the remote wire is better to run down the middle of the car and your power on the side where the battery is and the RCA on the opposite side. This reduces the amount of sound running through the wiresthat can jump from wire to wire when you run them together...

buy them a scratching post or what ever its called . they are pretty cheap . have a look in a pet shop & get some ideas & then go to a cheap shop if money is a problem. I would put some catnap in the cat scratch thingy  because they go ape over catnap . also if that fails squirt a small amount of water at them when you catch them & scold them at the same time. NEVER declaw them !! how cruel is that. good luck

go to http://www.optoutprescreen.com. . This is the only way to remove yourself from the pre-approved or pre-screened credit offers.  You may get non-screened offers still, but you should see your mail cut by 75%, at least with credit offers.. . Rumor has it, you might even see a small increase in your credit scores, since you won't be getting pounded with offers for I believe 3 years.

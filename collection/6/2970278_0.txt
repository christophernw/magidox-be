In legal terms, "common law" refers to legal principles established by judges (in their written opinions) which have the effect of law (and can only be overridden by a higher appellate court or by the Legislature).  In marital terms, "common law" refers to the legal presumption that a man and wife who have cohabitated (lived together) and substantially established a life together are essentially married for all intents and purposes.  This is now the law in only a minority of states.  It was designed to prevent the injustice that occurs when couples disband and the lack of formality causes one party to be cheated out of an equitable share of their joint possessions and assets.

if the cold thing is cold and crystaline, like pyrex or ice, the object cracks because of rapid localised expansion.. . If it is really really cold, the water will crystalise.. . If cold water hits something hot it forms little drops with a protectice steam jacket and they bounce around for ages, a cool experiment for home on a hot frying pan. (only uses drops of water though)

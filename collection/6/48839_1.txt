You might try to connect the the Tivo with RCA wires.  If that doesn't work, you might check with a local electronics store (Radio shack,Best Buy, Etc.  Or the store you bought it all from)  Diagram how you have the wires hooked up then ask them to tell you if it's right or not.  You might also consider an A/V Switch.  The switch allows all the inputs their own space, but only one output, some also have a second output for recording devices  Clear as mud aint it :)  Good luck

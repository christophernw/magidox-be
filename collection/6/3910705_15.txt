There are many, many reasons, many of which are economic.  I will stick with functinal reasons.. . 1) In the event that you would have to bail out, commerical airliners are not configured to allow you to do this safely . . 2) Getting a parachute out from under a seat and onto the bodies of terrified passengers during an emergency is too difficult to contemplate.. . 3) Getting people to put the chutes on right is a huge challenge, much less teach them to deploy them after correctly exiting the aircraft.  . . 4) Ever see a child-sized parachute?. . 5) Would you fly on a commercial aircraft that carried parachutes for its passengers?...not exactly a vote of confidence.. . 6) let's say you bailed out at 30,000 feet at 600 miles per hour (yeah right), how doyou get enough oxygen to avoid blacking out?  Stay warm?  Float in the water one you land?

If you have chronic bad breath it is most likely due to poor oral hygiene.  Brushing your teeth is not enough.  Microscopic bacteria stick between yourteeth and under the gum line where your toothbrush can never reach. These bacteria include highly putrid sulfide compounds which can also stick between the tiny papilla on your tongue.  If these bacteria (plaque biofilm) are not removed, your breath will be deadly!  you need a professional cleaning from a registered dental hygienist or periodontist and then to maintain a clean mouth by flossing every day between the teeth and under the gums and brushing your tongue until it's a nice, bright pink colour (unless you genetically have a white hairy tongue, drink a lot of alcohol or smoke)  If you really want an intelligent/educated answer, check out this site:. www.halimeter.com/touyz1.htm (a scientific perspective on oral malodor)

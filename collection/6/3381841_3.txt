When drying off after your shower or bath you rub dead skin cells off your body onto your towel. . Try getting out of the shower and rubbing your arm or leg vigorously with your towel and you'll see the bits of skin. These accumulate on your towel after each use, so every time you reuse your towel you're rubbing dead skin back onto your body.

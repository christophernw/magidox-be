Morality is basically a set of rules, or a code of conduct that enables civilized people to live together in a society.. It has nothing to do with a 'higher power' but primitive people would be unlikely to accept rules and regulations dictated by just another person, so god was invented to keep a journal of who's doing what to whom.

Try pilates type exercises...my daughter had a baby 3 months ago and is slowly getting back into shape using the pilates system...but realize that it takes time as well as exercise and diet changes to get the shape you want!  You need to consume less calories than what you burn as well as tone up the areas that have been stretched to their limits during the pregnancy!  Don't despair!  I have had 5 children...still have the love handles and earned every inch of them!

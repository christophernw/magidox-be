why not take a more diplomatic approach and try to find ways to get her to run after you begging you for it? Examine your own approach and see what "incentives" would work for her that you could use to your advantage....lots to read between the lines here but the bottom line is do you know what pushes her buttons? if not, then the answer lies within you..just dig in and try to find it.

We're supposed to be in the winter but it's still hot in here (Haifa). I'm not from Jerusalem but I know it's hot during the day and cold during the night. At least this is how the weather has been all week long. Don't wear anything warm during the day but take a jacket or something in case it changes. They say it's going to be a bit colder this weekend.

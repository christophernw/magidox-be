What happen when you freeze meat or fish is that the bacteria already present in or on the food goes into hibernation when it is frozen.. When the product is defrosted, the bacterias wake up and start multiplying again thus producing more of them.. If you freeze the product again and then defrost it after the process will start again producing even more bacterias.. If in doubt throw it away. You don't want to risk food poisoning, trust me!!!

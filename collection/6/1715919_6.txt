You are headed down the right path, you have conquered the first step already, WANTING TO CHANGE!! Congradulations!. Now it is time to set goals for yourself, take baby steps though.  Changing yourself can't happen in one day. Start by writing what you want to change about yourself. Then write a mission statement that you can eaisily put in your wallet/purse, tape to your mirror or put somewhere you will see many times a day.  Example: Today i will eat at least one healthy meal.  or Today i will through out some of my old clothes that i don't want anymore and shop for a few items that i would like to try.  Start with small things, like getting a routine going for yourself day to day, Then work your way up to the bigger things.  Changing yourself takes COMMITMENT and the will to do it.  you cant just start one day and then take a few days off.  It will never work.  Just stick with it and you will succeed.  Good Luck!!

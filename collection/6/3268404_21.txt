My cat drinks from the tap, i run it just a little bit, the vet told me they love running water the best, rather than bowls, i thought it was a bit gross to let him drink at the tap but i always clean it well, he never actually touches the tap itself but drinks the falling water. I dont mind as he's part of the family. Maybe you should try it.

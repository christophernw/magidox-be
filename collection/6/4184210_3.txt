It is certainly not a crime to want peace & quiet in one's own home, but sometimes, as in your case, is next to impossible.  The reason dog barking issues are so difficult to resolve is because barking is a natural thing dogs do.  While some may bark more than others, some can be downright annoying, I know.  The police cannot make the owner muzzle his dog, nor can they make him get rid of it.  They can't "counsel" the dog and make him stop, so what else can be done?  Nothing, as far as the dog is concerned. I once lived outside the city limits and my neighbor that lived behind me had a COW and a ROOSTER in her back yard.  I of course complained to the authorities, but to no avail.  What I did find helpful was keeping music or the T.V. on almost constantly to drown out the noise. Here are some other things you may find helpful..... . Pray that the neighbor moves sometime soon.. Pray that you move sometime soon.. Pray that someone dognaps the dog..  . If your neighbor and you are on good terms (which is probably doubtful)you my suggest this to him. I trained my dog to stop barking by throwing a bucket of water on him.  It took me a few times, but eventually he stopped.  This did not keep him from barking when there was a need to.

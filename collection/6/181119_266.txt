I once worked for a mining corporation and spent the summer on a survey crew in the middle of nowhere, Nevada. They supplied us tents and food and we rode to the job in a Jet ranger helicopter every day. I was like, 21 or so and we couldnt really spend our money, so I had a lot saved up when the job was finished. It was a great summer,  I would do it again !

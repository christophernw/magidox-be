heheeh This is hilarious. When I was little, my grandfa told me that.. A long long time ago, when men didn't have the adams apple on their necks.. They talk as much as women do. Men and women talked and argued too much, therefore God got mad. He stuff a nail (adams apple) between the men throat so the men could not talk as much as the women anymore..   It helped :) Now you only hear they complain about the women, how she nags, complains, whines, and b*tching about life ;) . ...

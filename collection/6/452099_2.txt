put your feet together.  Now raise one foot up off the ground as if it was levitating, and leave the other foot on the ground, except for the heel.  So you are raising one whole foot, and the other you are only raising the heel.  You keep the feet together, and when viewed from certain angles, people will think you are levitating.  Practice it in front of a mirror.  I have done this and totally blew peoples' minds.  It's quite fun!. . The important thing is to keep the heels together at the same level as you raise them.. Also, play it up.  Doing this may make you lose your balance, and that's ok.  Just pretend like you lost your concentration and fell.

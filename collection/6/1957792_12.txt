In the Islamic faith, Muhamed is the first to have proclaimed a belief in a singular god.  One of the pillars of Islam is "There is no god but god, and Muhamed is the prophet of god".  Monotheism was a challenge to the existing multi god religions of his contemparies.  He was not welcomed.  In fact, he was run out of town.  He held fast to his beliefs.. . As a Christian, I do not share those beliefs.  I also do not view Jesus as a prophet.  He is the Messiah, the fullfillment of prophecy (His words, not mine).  In other faith based ideologies, there are other beliefs.  I do not believe their goal is to insult us.. . If you profess to be a Christian, please refer to Bible.  Peter cut off the centurions ear in an effort to defend Jesus.  What did Jesus do?  It is clear that Jesus is here to assist us. He does not need us to be His protector. He is here to protect us.

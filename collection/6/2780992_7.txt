Because we are trying to fix the problems you Democrats have created::9-11.etc.etc . Well now, lets see if we can put a few things in perspective for those among us who are the truly imbecilic, moronic, ignoramuses who think GWB is stupid.. . Shall we compare what a stupid guy has done to what any of you have done - don't worry this will take about a second.. . Here is a guy who, out of of 300 million people, has been selected twice to lead the country and who serves in the most powerful position of anyone in the country.. . The USA is the most powerful, both economically and militarily, country on a planet with over 6 billion people on it. Does that make him the smartest guy on the planet? Probably not. Does it make him smarter than you? Without a doubt. . . But let's continue. Shall we?. . While you might consider him stupid, he was apparently smarter than the 100 million or so democrats who tried to defeat him in his last 8 elections. Plus, he received higher grades in college than the latest 2 liberal candidates threw up against him.. . So, if according to you he is stupid, how has he also accomplished all of these things against people who you must consider smarter than you or why would you vote for them? . . I would challenge you to take a look at your own pathetic, monumentally insignificant and truly worthless life and tell us all what you have accomplished in a way of even the most remote comparison. . . The purpose of the question is to find exactly where YOU must inevitably rank on the intellectual scale in comparison since you have virtually nothing, either in your past or future, which will come close to a single one of gwb's accomplishments?. . Looking at it that way, if you consider him stupid and he has accomplished all of these things, it must kind of make you feel about as insignificant and worthless as a drop of water in the worlds oceans. Or, to put it in terms you can relate to, a piece of cow sh*t in the middle of a 100,000 acre pasture.

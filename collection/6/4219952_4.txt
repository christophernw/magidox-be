thanks for the question, i would advise that if you could email question to askislam@aol.com ( responses will take 1-2 weeks) as you will get answers with refrences that you can check up your self and will get replied by someone that has more understanding abt islam.  . If you would like more info abt islam just for information purposes (dnt worry not telling you to convert here) i think these three websites are preety good. . http://www.islamchannel.tv. http://www.islamalways.com ( this one shows preety good media clips). http://www.watchislam.com

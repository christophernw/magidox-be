Dude, seriously.I was at a church in Alabama in 2004 before the Presidential vote and the preacher told us all to vote against abortion and such (basically telling us to vote Repub).  I am actually disappointed that to get elected in Congress or President you have to be mean and campaign the way these people have this time.  It's ridiculous whoever you vote for.

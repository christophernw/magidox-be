In hypothermia, the body is so cold that it starts directing blood to only the core extremities of the body (heart, trunk) and away from the hands, feet, arms and legs. This directs the heat from the blood to the most important areas of the body. That's why you get frost bitten on the fingers, nose and toes first. Then afterwards, if the body is not able to retain its heat, then the body goes into shock and your organs start failing and etc.. etc..

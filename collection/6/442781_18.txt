because the public school system is a sham and a disgrace...they seek to keep us ignorant so they can imprison us, strip us of our rights, deny our votes and so on and so forth!. . That is where community iniatives come into place...if people would share there experiences with the laws then there would be no excuses...the problem is those in power know that we don't know the laws and subsequently use that to their advantage to bully their will on us....i went to vote last weekin my city which has 41,000 voters and only 3,000 people voted...that is why government can get over on us so much...because we don't use what little power we do have for the little things....they know that they can confuse and discourage us form the "big vote". .

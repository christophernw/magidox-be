What you are hearing is called brake grind..  Brake pads have been long worn out and now there is no friction material left of the pads so the metal backing plates are being ground into your rotors. Most likely, you also have a pedal pulsation under your foot when braking. This means your rotors are completely worn out. They are too thin and are warped..  If left alone, the next thing to be damaged are the calipers..  And this is provided you have not crashed into someone or something first..  Your car is broken, get it fixed or stop driving it until it is fixed. It is a hazard

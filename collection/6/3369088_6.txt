There's a bad element of Islam that should be stopped...Fanatics.. I sometimes wonder about the spread of religion.. Catholicism was strongest in the middle ages when every aspect of the  faith was corrupt.  It could well be that Islam have gained momentum in the past few years because of the negative activities of Islamic Fanatics.. You need not fear the spread of true Islam; fear the fanatics.

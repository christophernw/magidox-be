man oh man...where to start...what makes you think that Hitler invented white supremacy? And why send them back to Germany? Open an American History book to see who started that mess, do not blame it on the Germans or Hitler for that matter...what about the KKK, what about slavery? Get your facts straight! Hitler was not new, original or even very smart. Lots of people before him were racist. By the way Hitler took his model for facism from Mussolini... should we send the racists to Italy?

i dont admit that man is animal ,ALLAH ALMIGHTY has a lot of creations in this world and in  all these HUMAN BEINGS are best ( no doubt )..     Every specie has its own chromosomal number and its own identity so i dont agree with those persons who say that man is animal or man was an animal in begining ,.      as far as similarities are concerned between man and animal ,,, i want to clear that . . every living being has its all responses based on three things . 1-  food. 2- protection. 3- survival ( reproductive potential).   every specie either man or any animal ,wants to satisfy these three basic things .... and due to these some times we have same behavirol responses as those of animals ....     as far as chempensy is concerned this is the animal having LARGEST BRAIN after HUMAN BEINGS.. so he has more thinking power than other animals BUT LESS THAN MAN ,.    then comes the point of EVOLUTION .... evolution can result in the adaptations ( physiological or psychological ) but it can never convert a SPECIE into another one.that can be done only by GENETIC MUTATATIONS ...  i hope u got wt i said ....

I don't know why people are in such a rush to buy the new thing. This is a perfect example. Of all new game systems that come out, the first run of the products usually have flaws in them. Yes you should return it, and hopefully they will give you one that is newer off of the assembly line, because the errors that happened when they first released them should be corrected. I'm waiting till much later this year before I think about getting them.

I think what you meant was the 'Chikungunya' virus, which is an arbovirus found in Asia and Africa. It is spread by the Aedes aegyptii mosquitoes. It is one of the viral hemorrhagic fevers, and the patient can have signs and symptoms like fever of sudden onset, haemorrhagic rash (due to bleeding) joint pains and enlarged Lymph nodes. It has caused epidemics and outbreaks and no vaccine is available for preventing it.

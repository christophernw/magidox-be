You might be been in a sleep state where your mind is awake but your body is paralysed. This is a natural mechanism of the body to prevent you from acting out your dreams. You can get out this state easily by wishing to move a small part of your body eg: a finger or toe.. . If you are strong believer of the paranormal, get a priest, medicne man or a vodoo master to give you some advise.

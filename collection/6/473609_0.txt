You have to concentrate, to know what you are studing, to understand what you are reading, don't think in anything else, don't think in how long you have been studying while studying, bescause the thing is not how long, the thing is how much have you learnt, you have to concentrate, be confortble while studying and READ. I'm very good at maths. You don't really need to study maths, you have to understand maths, you have to read an explanation, there's no need to study maths, you only have to know them.. . Also, when you think you have learnt all, write down what you know, make a questionary and answer it, then read that questionary every day and make those questions to yourself, be sure you know them all, the day of the test read the questionary and check you know it all at the morning, very at the morning, take a bath, and then study again, that will definitely work.

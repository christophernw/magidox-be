Ring Bologna is bologna, kielbasa is sausage. They are both made from animal parts. My adopted grandmother taught me a recipe for eating ring bologna.  Take the casing off and slice into thin strips into a medium size bowl.  Then slice a couple of small sweet, vidalia, or yellow onions into the bowl.  Cover it all with apple cider vinegar then let marinate.  After it has marinated for about a day, you can then eat the bologna slices and onion slices on crackers.  Yummmm!

That's very bad news, always check for tank rust when buying a used bike.. . If the rust is bad, the tank is done. If you are getting flakes of rust that sounds terminal to me, the tank is weak, may be leaking, and your gonna be plugging fuel filters all the time. I'd starting looking for a replacement tank.

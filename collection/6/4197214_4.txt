its jus coz of the pressure exerted on the G-spot, which is located on the upper walls of the vagina. she will probably have a sensation which urges her to piss, but its actually jus the pressure. nothin to worry about and doctor??? lol!!. . u can tune her by giving a G-spot massage with ur fingers.. G spots r located 3-4" inside, so it would be better to use ur middle finger. . insert finger and feel for a hard shell like surface, the size of a coin. apply pressure for nearly 10sec, during which ur chick might find it a bit painful, but it is this that leads to the ultimate & sensational orgasm. plus she will get over the pissin tendency. . for further queries,feel free to mail me. . regards

Get a hold of your local Tech school. They should offer a GED course. It is equal to the diploma and it's easy to get and you can study at your own pace, which is great if you have kids. Usually the only thing you have to pay for is the test itself, which is about $20 - $30 for each subject, and there are about 4 or 5, and you can take one at a time, as you finish them. So you can study say, math, then take the test then move on to the next subject. You should be able to get more information from your local college or tech school. Best of luck!!

In Chapter 13, the Debtor proposes a plan for the repayment of a portion of his or her debt (though sometimes, the portion is 0%).  The plan must be confirmed by the Court before it is effective.  Creditors and the Chapter 13 trustee have an opportunity to object to the plan.  The confirmation hearing is the hearing during which the judge considers any objections and decides whether to accept ("confirm") the plan.

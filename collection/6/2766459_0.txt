A person has to be open to you hypnotizing them. Most hypnotists recieve training in using suggestive language and other techniques to induce deep relaxation, but the receiver has to be willing and ready to be hypnotized. It can't just be done because you want to do it to them. Find a licensed hypnotherapist, and ask them.

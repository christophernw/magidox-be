melaleuca / "tea tree" essential oil. put a little drop on a Q-tip & apply directly to the blemish. (you can get this at a health food store or a natural foods market.). Also - use a moisturizer (a light, non-comedogenic one [non pore clogging]) once a day & it will trick the skin into producing less oil. the skin thinks, "wow. i can quit producing so much oil because i have moisture now!" . And don't OVER WASH your face. it makes your oil glands produce more oil. use a face wash with salicylic acid in it NOT benzoyl peroxide. the salicyclic acid is gentle & reduces the dirt and oil in the blemishes. benzoyl peroxide is too drying and again, makes your skin produce too much oil.. . Tea tree before bed works for me. my zit is gone when i wake up!. . p.s. don't pick at them or squeeze them unless they're ready to blow. try not to anway & put the tea tree directly on them. if you MUST mess with them, try not to piss them off by using two Q-tips to gently squeeze from both sides. if you use your fingers, you're putting bacteria back into them. or you break the skin with your nails. or they just swell up and look worse.

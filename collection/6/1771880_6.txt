you would find him almost at the very beginning of history...supposedly the bible says that it is a mark of Cain, that when he disobeyed god and killed his brother, that he and his descendants were turned black...but it also says a bit later that at the tower of babel god got mad cause they were trying to build a tower to heaven so he made them all different races with different languages....but scientifically, black ,asian and white all arrived on the scene at the same time...my guess would be rapid evolution in wildly different climates caused these cosmetic changes...cause that is all it is, cosmetics.....i dont think that there is any way we could inter-reproduce if we were not genetically the exact same animal.......

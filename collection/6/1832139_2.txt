Relatively new phenomenon, starting only after the spread of handheld GPS devices.. . Essentially a high tech treasure hunt.  Someone places a cache somewhere, typically on public land but in a concealed area off the beaten path so it is unlikely for people to just stumble across it.  Most often, they then post the location of the cache or a clue to it's location on a geocaching site on the Internet.  Caches can include all sorts of cool things or just a logbook to record that you found it.  There are a number of variations of the sport.

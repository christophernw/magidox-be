A mp3 player is basically the same thing except it only  accepts mp3's..  an I pod is very popular.. but i haven't got one because i have a rocken cell phone with mp3 in it..   I would say the ipod is great i think they are neat.. but for convenience I like having my phone and music all in one less junk to carry around..

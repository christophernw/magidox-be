Well, it does make you pee more often. But it won't make you loose weight. It might make you think you do because you loose the weight of the water excreted in urine but your body will quickly produce hormones to retain fluids so you will be back at your normal weight within hours.. . Be careful though! Abusing diuretics can cause dehydration which can cause other medical problems. Take care of yourself!

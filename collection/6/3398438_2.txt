Don't work to hard at it .... Just be yourself.... Know that it's okay to be you what ever that is...Now if you believe you have emotional problems get help!!...If you find your just different and people have made you feel like that's a bad thing ...WRONG you are find being different is okay...Just live the way you want to live and be happy in it....Good Luck....Angel

That isn't normal; you shouldn't need to bathe a Rottie more than once every two months.  I'd take him to the vet right away.  Unfortunately,  some types of cancer cause a very offensive body odor - I hope it's not that.  Sometimes a bad tooth can lead to a dental infection, but you would probably smell that in bad breath, not body odor.  Good luck.

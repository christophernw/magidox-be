Religiously speaking, the conscience is God's presence, the extra pull toward the inclination to do good instead of the simple "fight or flight" and "herd instinct" responses. . Scientifically speaking, we're the only beings on Earth that possess consciences because we're the most developed, and we have created distinctions between right and wrong. . To wit; no other species on the planet has created that disctinction. They may feel any number of things, but they don't know whether it's right or wrong to do so, they are only concerned with survival and the natural order of things. A dog isn't loyal to you because it feels that's the right thing to do, it's loyal to you because you are the alpha, so to speak.

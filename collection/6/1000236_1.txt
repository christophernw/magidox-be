fashions illustrated in magazines are not just "designs" that someone sends in.  they are the fabricated completed designs of established fashion designers (or "houses") that the magazine's fashion editor has selected to be featured.. . if you want to get into the business, you will have to finish your basic education (high school diploma or GED) and study fashion design after high school, either in a junior college, college, university or fashion design school, get a job with a clothing designer or manufacturer, and work your way into the industry.  good luck and best wishes to you!

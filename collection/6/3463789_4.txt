1st let me say that I am NOT picking on one Christian Religion.  I believe that each denomination has a little piece of truth that we all can learn from.  And there are "true gems" in each.  . . However I do feel this is the truth.  1Cr 14:33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.      I truly feel that it is the evil forces in the world trying to keep everybody in strife.   If "they" keep the Christians from agreeing then why would people on the outside want to join in.  . To people on the outside it looks like all the Christians are saying the same thing but are still arguing, and it really looks stupid.   . If you are looking for a church I suggest that you visit several until you find the Pastor, not congregation, that you feel is the most loving.   Once you become a part of that church you will tell the "pew warmers" from the "loving outreach team".. . God says to test the fruit... if the fruit is rotten stay away.

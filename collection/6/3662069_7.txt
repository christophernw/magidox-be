Perfection is, broadly, a state of completeness and flawlessness. . That is perfect:. . 1. which is complete â€” which contains all the requisite parts;. . 2. which is so good that nothing of the kind could be better;. . 3. which has attained its purpose.. . Perfection is unattainable in a spiritual sense, because you can not attain your purpose, and are always improving, until you reach heaven or hell. . . And as a side note, Sex was not commanded. It was given to us, and it was the Gospel of Paul that tells us NOT to have sex, but if we must to marry. Sex was a gift, not a command. Sex is a sin, and should not be done, but if you must get married. Jesus didn't have it because he was sinless, he had no lust to make him want to have sex.

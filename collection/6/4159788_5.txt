In my opinon the best way to break up a jail relationship is to tell the person how much you care for them, but you can no longer live this way. You need someone that will be there for you, someone to hold you, always there when you need them. And him/her being locked up cant help you out with any of your needs. Also make sure to tell the person that when they get out that you MAY be able to restart whatever it was you all were doing before they were sentenced to jail. But you do not have to restart your life with the person if you do not want to. Make sure you make that plain and clear!!!!!!!

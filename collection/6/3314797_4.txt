Energy is not "lost" it is converted to a form that cannot be used.. . Drop a ball from a certain height and the ball does not bounce back to the original height...that is because some of the energy was converted to sound (you hear the ball hitting the floor)...some was converted to heat (the ball and the spot on the floor where it hit are just a teeny bit warmer). . For the most part you can observe this "lost" energy (usually they are in the form of heat, light or sound)

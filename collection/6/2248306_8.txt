Ignore all that mumbo jumbo and listen up.  I don't care if your christian, athiest or if you worship the red guy with black horns.. . Humans scratch, sniff, poop and produce just like anything else on the world we live in.  . . We are animals in a sense but we are human animals.  God created us above all the other species, but he based us off of his first creations.  He took all his favored parts and made a species above all others to rule the planet.. . So when he created us, he made us elite.  We are just based off his other creations.

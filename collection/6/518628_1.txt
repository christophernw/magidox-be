The remaining book value can be from intangible assets like goodwill, trademarks, copyrights, organization costs, non-compete agreements & others. Many of which could be worth considerably less than the carring value on the books. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging usually from 5 to 15 years.. . Hope this helps.

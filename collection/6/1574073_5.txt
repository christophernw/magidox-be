A girl doesn't become a woman simply because she has her period.. Would you consider a 9-12 year old a woman? No.. Same with a boy....ejaculating (around 11) and growing pubic hair do not make you a man.. Neither does turning 18, in my opinion.. A boy becomes a man when he starts to take responsibility for himself and his own actions. Getting a job. Supporting himself. Being accountable for the things he says and does. When they stop whining to mommy about this or that.. Same for a girl becoming a woman.

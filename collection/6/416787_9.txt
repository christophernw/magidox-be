I think that everyone should have a paper attached  to their shirt and also carry a stamper.  Anyone who is caught doing something totally stupid would get stamped by anyone witnessing the stupidity in question ( multiple witnesses for the same offense is only counted as one stamp) If a person get 3 stamps in a 24 hour period, he or she is required to stay at home away from other people for 5 days.

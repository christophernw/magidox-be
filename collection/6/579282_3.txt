it depends where it is from. if it is from the sims 2 game website it is in your sim file on drive c or something like that. but if you get it off a diff site you need to put it in your downloads folder in the sims2,documents, if you dont have a downloads folder make one called "downloads" . open your document downloads then you will have to extract them

Four different leaf shapes can be found on one sassafras tree: three lobed, elliptical, two lobed/right side, and two lobed/left side. The deciduous leaves can grow up to six inches by four inches, and the tree itself may grow up to about 30 feet on Assateague, and even up to 60 feet elsewhere. In the spring, small yellowish green flowers develop with the leaves; oval-shaped, blue fruits of less than half an inch follow.

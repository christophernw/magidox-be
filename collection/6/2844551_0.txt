Frater = brother.  . Soror = sister.  . Men have fraternities. Women have sororities. Masonry is a fraternity.. You would not ask why a woman cant belong to a college fraternity, so why would you ask why a woman cant belong to an independent fraternity?. Honestly, I dont understand why this question keeps coming up.

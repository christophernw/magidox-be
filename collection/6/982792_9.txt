Respect the religion.  Don't respect the people who use it as an excuse to "justify" their decisions/life/opinions.  Seriously, read the 10 commandments & Book of the Law of the Lord - I wouldn't say take all of it to heart, but for the most part, they've got good basic morals in it, just like any other religion.  The Golden Rule exists in all 5 major religions: "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.". . For thousands of years in thousands of cultures, religion has been a way to explain the unexplainable.  Why does it thunder?  Because Thor's pissed off.  . . Religion becomes something else when people use the religion to instill fear to make the followers/believers bend to the "leader"'s will.

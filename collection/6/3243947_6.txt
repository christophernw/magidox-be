Look in an equine reference book such as: Horses and Horsemanship by M.E.Emmesinger.  This book has great descriptions of gaits performed by different breeds.  American Saddlebreds can be trained to do 5 distinct gaits.They will walk, trot, canter naturally, but can also slow gait and rack. The slow gait is a smooth slow, animated gait with extreme motion.  It is sometimes called a singlefoot. The rack is basically a fast slow gait.  Tenn. walkers also have unique gaits

You refer to Capital? (o)?¿ if you refer to that Bolivia doesnt have two Capitals, Bolivia has one Capital (Sucre, where judicial power is) and the other (La Paz, is the seat of the goverment and legislative site).. . But when one asks you where is the Capital of Bolivia you have to say Sucre because Bolivia´s Foundation placed there, and dont say La Paz because its only the seat of two powers of the goverment.. . *Bolivia = Sucre

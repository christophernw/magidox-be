A pagan is anyone that is outside Christianity, Judism, or Islamic in their beliefs of God...i.e. have multiply gods or believe in the God/Goddess or Nature and what not.. Pagan also means "country-dweller" mostly because during the time when Judism was for those that practice Judism, and Christianity either wasn't around or was in its infancy, people saw God however they could understand a Superior Being. . Of course you have Satanist and Luciferians in this mix of paganism, as well as those that practice the "black arts" but for the most part pagans aren't hostile to anyones God, they just try to understand as best as possilbe who God is, and sometimes that doesn't match up with the Christian God, the Jewish God, or the Islamic God.. I suppose that I would be classified as a "pagan" just because I see God as having both male and female energies, i.e. I believe in the God/Goddess; one deity, two entities. But I also believe that Jesus was and is the Christ. . Religion and beliefs are complicated and often lead to hostility and misunderstanding of everyone that isn't of a certain view point. I believe that I am on the right path for me, that doesn't mean that I think everyone should think like me...but some others are not so "understanding". We all have our own paths to take...some "good" some that end "bad...but they are still all our own paths...if you ask Christians a certain question, you might get 50 different answers all for the same thing...it's not because they all aren't Christian, but everyone sees things a different way from another, even if they all go to the same church, and that goes for all religions and dogmas...not just Christians.. We all must respect each other and our choices...no amount of force will change someones beliefs...and that is the way we humans were made.

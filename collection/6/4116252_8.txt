The first answer is inaccurate. The proposed amendment would have amended the constitution to say that marriage had to be between a man and a woman, and this is what was shot down. . . Why do "they" have to have an amendment to ban gay marriages. It depends who "they" is and what you are really asking. Right now, states have the right to choose whether they will or will not honor and recognize same-sex marriage. Apparently our president feels the federal government needs to get involved in this, and apparently the senate disagreed with him.

Doctors give antibiotics for the infection, but you can buy Uristat at Target or Wal*mart and it will eliminate the symptoms while you're waiting for the antibiotics to work.  Just remember that it doesn't cure the infection, so you'll still need to see a doctor.... but at least you'll feel better while you're waiting.

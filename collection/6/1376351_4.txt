It would be best, if young people today, would take a moment of their time, heck take an afternoon of your time, and go talk to your grandparents.. I mean Really Talk to them. Do you have great grandparents still living?. I would urge you, if not beg you, to go and speak to them.. Do more than just "how you doin gramma, Good! I gotta get going now"..... No, PLEASE, Just sit down with them and listen to their answer, when you ask her or him.... "what does America, mean to you?". . They Endured.. They Sacrificed.. They Fought the Wars. They saw the promise . and. They Escaped "the old country" . for what you have now.. Freedom. Freedom to take the time, to sit down and talk. to your Gramma, Grampa, a Veteran of world war 2. A soldiers widow. . . Why do I ask you to speak to them? Because I/you/us/WE have been here so long, that we take all this for granted.. We need to feel, patriotism and devotion to this country.. We need this, for our own sakes and for the sake of the only truly free country on the face of this earth.. . America, is what you see in your great-grandparents eyes when they light up with pride.. . . THIS is the United States of America.

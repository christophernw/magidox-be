Completely normal to smell that way.. . Here is an excerpt from a kids health website that explains the smell:. . "Sweat is also known as perspiration (say: per-spuh-ray-shun), and it is made almost completely of water, with tiny amounts of other chemicals like ammonia (say: uh-mow-nyuh), urea (say: you-ree-uh), salts, and sugar. (Ammonia and urea are left over when your body breaks down protein.)"

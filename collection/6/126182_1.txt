Go to the police station, prepared to turn yourself in and ask them to run it.  If there is one, you have proven you want to face any charges and are not a flight risk, so bail may be reduced considerably.  If there is not one, you need to find out if there is a ticket or charges you need to address.  Find this out at the courthouse.. . Best Wishes,. Sue

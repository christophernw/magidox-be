he Ellipse. Let's get the bad news out of the way right now....          How accurately must I draw an ellipse?. Very accurately! The eye of the viewer can detect any irregularity in a shape that it fully understands. A "square" that does not have sides of equal length, a "circle" that is not circular and an "ellipse" that deviates from perfection is immediately noted as being not what it claims to be - or, more precisely, it is not what the eye expects to see in that situation and is detected as being "foreign". In short, a "circular" circle is accepted in passing and the overall reality of the scene is maintained. The same is true of the ellipse.. . . What is an Ellipse?. An ellipse is simply a circle seen in perspective. This is an important concept to keep in mind.. . An ellipse, therefore, must conform to the same rules as a circle - it consists of arcs, it contains no straight lines and, if divided into quarters, each segment is identical to the other three.. . . Breaking the problem down. . So, as with the circle, an ellipse contains four identical segments. To study this draw an ellipse using an ellipse template. Or use the circle/ellipse tool of a computer graphics programme to draw one (the basic MS Paint programme was used here) then print it out. Now draw a line vertically through the ellipse to divide it equally in half then draw another across it. It becomes immediately apparent that each quarter is identical to the others - just the orientation is different. The top left segment is a mirror image of the top right, which is a vertical mirror image of the bottom right segment below it... You've just reduced the problem by three-quarters - it's getting easier by the minute!. . . Study the geometry . . Now let's draw a box around our ellipse so we can properly study the geometry of one of those segments. If you're righthanded I suggest you concentrate on the top left - using the natural movement of your wrist, this is the first arc you will want to draw. Notice that both ends are "flat" to the sides of the box - an ellipse never comes to a point at the top or bottom. Notice also how the arc, as it travels from top to bottom, gently unwinds from a tight to a gentle curve. It does this smoothly with no hint of a straight section - this is, remember, a circle seen in perspective so only curves are involved.. . . First attempts. . . . . . . Keep your template or computer-drawn examples handy - they'll help you to draw the right curves in the following exercises. In time you'll be able to discard them and draw with understanding but, for now, I'll allow you to use a crib sheet! We'll start by repeating what you've leaned so far but in reverse.. . (1) Draw a square in perspective on a vertical plane (you will probably find it slightly easier to draw vertical ellipses at first). A square about 8cm high by 4cm (3"×1½") will be about right. Keep it small so you don't need to move your arm during the exercise and you can see the result without moving your eyes.. . (2) Divide it vertically in half (theoretically this isn't quite right but it's near enough). Then divide it in half horizontally.. . (3) Now let's get started. We'll begin in the top left segment but, if you're left-handed, you might prefer to start top right. Study again the curve that your template produced then try to repeat the geometry in your top left segment. Starting almost flat to the top line of the square begin to curve down towards the side's halfway point, gently lessening the curve as you go. Aim to meet the side in the same "flat" manner that you started. Getting this first curve right is the main trick - everything that follows is just going to be a copy of it.  Hint: As you draw your curve, it often helps to look at the spot you are aiming for rather than the line you are drawing - look ahead of your

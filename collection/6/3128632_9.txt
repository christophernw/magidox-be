It's not what it eats (it actually eats mostly rotting material), but what it poops.  Earthworms eat rotting material--not bad food for plants, but better after the worms digest and improve it because of microbes in their system.  Many people do composting with worms because they break up rotten stuff fast and well.  You get:  humus, which makes the black fluffy soil plants and gardeners love.  They also break up heavier soil by moving through it.  . Of course, if you asked a bird what a worm's purpose was, you'd get a very different answer ;-)

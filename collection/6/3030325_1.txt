if you can get access to a co2 bottle put your laptop in a plastic trash sack, shoot some gas in and bam! Dead ant.Borax and powdered sugar mixed together supposedly kill em too. Just don't let kids or pets get into it! If i could get any fine mesh filter screen to cover the holes and still allow air flow without the ant flow I would have to give that atry too.Especially if i wasnt ready to go computer shopping!!

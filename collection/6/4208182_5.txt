I think the biggest disadvantage is the sanctimonious holier than thou attitude they have and the scorn and contempt for other people who do not eat the same way they do.  Most of the vegetarians I know have low blood platelet count and I guess that's because they don't have enough protein in them.  Plus, they're not as passionate as people who eat red meat.  So I guess a disadvantage would be wanting to stand in a corner, highbrowing everyone else and growing roots.

i think u got to do some exercises along with  yoga early morning ... drink a lot of water... also take  this thing out of ur mind that u r de-energized or any thing that way... see no doctors can also help u out in this case... they wud only suggest u to take proper diet etc.  try to b cheerful and tension free.. enjoy n b happy .. take care of ur diet ... i think all this wud definitely help.... okay...:)

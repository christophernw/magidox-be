There are no halophilic bacteria. Halophiles are from the kingdom archaea, which is completely different from eubacteria, which is what we think of as bacteria. Halophiles are, on the other hand, much different genetically, so much so that they need their own taxonomic kingdom. Halophiles and bacteria used to all be in the same kingdom because it used to be thought that they were similar. This is known now to not be the case. . . Anyway, halophiles are single celled organisms similar in appearance to bacteria that can live in extremely salty conditions. Halophile actually means 'salt loving'.. . Bacteria are any organisms from the kingdom eubacteria. They have cell walls, no nucleus, reproduce asexually. They come in many shapes and sizes.

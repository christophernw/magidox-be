Sign over a legal document in the presence of the person you are signing the rights over to, a judge, an attorney and our heavenly almighty being.. . But, you better have a good reason other than to get out of child support.  I would suggest that you use this "I don't want to confuse the child by taking the child out of the home and playing ping pong with the child or using the child as a pawn between me and the other person. Right now the child is in a stable environment and has better things going for them and I would just be a barrior to their develeopment."

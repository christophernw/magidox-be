you are right. . . i grew up in a family of 4 boys and 1 girl...me.  toilet seats were always up.  . . my husband, however, likes the actual "lid" down.  for a long time, i didn't take note of that, and never put it down.  then, one of my brothers moved close by, and was out our house frequently, and never put the seat down.... . i realized what a thoughtful person my husband was.  he NEVER does that.  so...if he likes the lid down, so be it...i always remember to put the lid down.

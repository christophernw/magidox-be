I think that the scandal was more like icing on the cake rather than a last straw.  All in all it was the over reaching for power by the Bush administration that turned the tide and brought about the results of this election. We've been fed bull on a fear colored platter. People woke up to that. . It's one thing to have fear of an enemy half way around the world and another to have fear of your own government. This is a fear that the American people can deal with directly at the polls. And we have spoken.

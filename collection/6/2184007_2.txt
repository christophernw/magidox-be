All of the above listed processes involve the oxidation of carbon, hydrogen and other minor elements to produce heat as combustion processes are exothermic i.e. they evolve heat. Paper and wood have cellulose(polysaccharide with C and H), butane is a alkane with 4 C and 10 H and coal is a complex mixture of Hydrocarbons (i.e. compounds of C and H).

Yes.  The vagina can be tightened without surgery.  There is an exercise called kegals that can be done in order to achieve results.  It is very easy to do.  This exercise can be done virtually anywhere.  You can do the kegal exercise when you are sitting in the car, in front of the computer, or where ever you may be.  I am not to sure how others will react when seeing you do this in public.  But the exercise is simple.  The best place to practice is when you are urinating.  Try to stop the flow by tightening your buttocks.  If you can completely pause the stream you are good to go, if not- you have some work to do.  The vagina is one big muscle.  Just work it out with the kegals and do the pee test to determine progress.

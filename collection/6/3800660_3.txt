You took the words right out of my mouth Fawnalyn thanks, you said it all.. . . Let me get this straight you have now STOLEN a wild bird, taking it from it's family and you have the nerve to accuse us of being neglective? Your the a$$ who took the bird and you dont know how to take care of it? You should have thought of that before you Stole it. It is not our responsiablity to tell you how to care for a wild bird, nor will I tell you. . If you want to do right by this bird you will let it lose and it will take care of itself unless you have already mauled it to death tryin to feed it. . . Let the dam bird go free, and go to the store and buy a Parakeet, and stop being a moron. How many people have to tell you that you shouldnt have it? Personally I really dont believe you did catch the bird, because you have been to busy on here pissing people off with all your Mockingbird questions, you haven't had time to go and locate one.. Grow up!

In all actuality all we are are numbers. Nobody really cares what your name is when they are getting money from you and when the government looks at you..   To put yourself out there by helping people, volunteering, spending time with your brother or sister, and/or having a child is when you really have a name. Now think would you rather be a number all your life or be a name?

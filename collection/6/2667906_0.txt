Thie thing is that they can think for themselves, but even more so, when you pull back the layers of the world you see the systems that exist underneath everything we see, and there is just no room in this scientific world for a supernatural being of such magnitude.. . If science found a place where god is then i'd bet they'd be believing in seconds, but science has only served to prove that there isn't. Science has advanced our civilisation, but hindered faith... was it really worth it?

If you mean how to sleep early i would say thinks of something in school or at work you really enjoy doing and cant wait for the next day so just sleep.. . And if you mean waking up i said set ur alarm to ur time and when you wake up think about u being chased by a dog with super speed power with an eqiped axe or dont put ur air on cold!or ull want to sleep more just set  it on warm and also make sure at night when ur sleeping feel really cozy and have bout 8 - 10 hours o' sleep.

Dear Milo when people die, the beauty of the holy spirit is in their presence and only us the ones left behind ask this question.  If someone in your life has pass on to what ever awaits us all after this life, then I would only answer to you is with question.  Life is just borrow time we are born to die and live in everlasting eternal life when it is our time.  The greatest gift we are giving is this body that our lord has let us have to love and appreciate.  We sometimes take it for granted and only realize it when one dies.  The greatest price in life is death, no one wants to die and those who don't want to live have died within themselves only cause the moment came. Most people will let this be cause they did not reach to most comfort of all and that is our lord Jesus Christ.  Through him and only him will you and anybody asking the same question may find what you are looking for and you can never go wrong with the power of our lord.  The only thing I can tell you Milo is every day I wake up I thank my lord for another day at the time being.  And before I go to sleep I thank the lord for that day and ask him to look over me and those I love and if tomorrow never comes I love my lord to give him my soul and if tomorrow never comes I love my life and my family more than ever today.  At any moment you or me can die and another will ask WHY PEOPLE ARE DYING?  Let live and love rest my friend!  Farewell!

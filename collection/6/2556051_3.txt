The chart datum is the level of water that charted depths displayed on nautical charts are measured from.. . Chart datum is height of water at the lowest possible theoretical tide also known as the lowest astronomical tide (commmonly abbreviated to "LAT"). Calulation of the LAT only allows for gravitational effects so lower tides may occur in practice due to other factors (e.g. meterological effects, such as high pressure systems).. . Charted depths and drying heights on nautical charts are given relative to chart datum. Tide tables give the height of the tide above chart datum. This makes it possible to calculate the depth of water at a given point and a given time by adding the charted depth to the height of the tide. To calculate whether an area that dries is under water, subtract the drying height from the height of the tide.

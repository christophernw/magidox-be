Jesus was not "in love", He loves all people good and bad.  You need to read the Bible and quit going to movies because youare getting pretend and reality confused.  Prostitution is a sin because it is either adultery or fornication, which are both sins.  Sex is for marriage, not for mindless entertainment between people who usually don't even know each others middle name.

I want to go to Australia and New Zealand because I have never been there.  I've been to Africa and am glad I went (we did a 'safari camp' over a water hole at a place called 'Treetops' for example) however, it is a long flight and I probably won't end up going back.  The place I most like to go back to is the Greek Islands, for their history.  However, the next trip I plan will probably be to Germany, because my family originally was from there, and I would like my children to see it.

I am shocked to learn that you find endless quotes from the Bible to be boring. But seriously, people who quote from the Bible (very selectively I might add), do so because they are incapable of thinking things through for themselves and simply rehash the same turgid message.. . Whoops, I missed 101's entry above in typing this reply - that's exactly what you can expect - more quotes from the Bible to answer your question, and the belief that they are allowed to inflict this on you because they are only trying to "save" you.. . It's possible to prove just about anything with selective quotes from the Bible - you can find the death penalty supported and opposed for example.

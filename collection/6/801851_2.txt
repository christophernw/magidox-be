Most people who play video games regularly become obsessed with one game or another for a period of time.  Part of the reason for that is that when you play a game, you get better at it over time, and it becomes more fun as a result.  In addition, you meet a network of friends whom you play with as a form of socializing combined with competition, sort of like sports.. . Socom 3 is one of the best games out there right now, so there are a lot of gamers who are really into it.  Eventually, he'll either plateau (i.e. stop getting better) and get bored, or else he'll burn out (i.e. stop having fun) and get himself off the game.  Unfortunately for most hardcore gamers, there'll always be another great game eventually, so don't expect this to be a one-time thing.  Gaming is probably going to be a part of his life as long or longer than you are.. . That being the case, if you really like this guy, you need to start planning things with him ahead of time and holding him to those plans.  Hardcore gamers tend to use their free-time (i.e. unplanned time) playing games. So during his hardcore periods, you're going to have a hard time convincing him to do non-gaming activities on a regular basis, unless he's already promised you he'd do something else.. . If you find yourself making plans with him, and he's STILL gaming instead of keeping the plans, that means one of two things (or a combination of both):. . A. he doesn't like you enough to keep his promises. B. he's one of the gamers who is so addicted that he's lost all sense of proportional importance of the game versus real life.. . Either way, that would be the time to break up with him, because if it's A. you can do better, and if it's B., by sticking with him, you're enabling him to be a jerk and a loser, instead of getting his gaming habits in balance with the rest of his life.  Good luck.

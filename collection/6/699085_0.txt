I believe most electric scooters have an onboard charger, so you 'plug in the scooter'.  You really wouldn't need a garage, but you do need a power outlet with an extension cord.. I suppose if it were more convenient to you, you could buy a battery charger and just take the battery and charger into the house for the night to charge it.

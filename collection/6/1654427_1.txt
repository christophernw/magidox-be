No, I think it is an EIP teacher. It stands for Early Intervention Program teacher. . The purpose of Early Intervention Program is to provide additional instructional resources to help students who are performing below grade level in math and reading obtain the necessary academic skills to reach grade level performance in the shortest possible time. . . This program is not a special education program but is a special assistance program allowing the student-teacher ratio to be reduced for part of the day. During that part of the school day, two certified teachers(EIP and classroom) will work together in the regular math classroom. In addition to the reading instruction in the regular classroom, the EIP teacher will work with students in a small group setting for extra reading assistance. . Where do you live? I am an LD teacher and we have 2 openings for next fall.

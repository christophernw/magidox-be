Lets assume that the re-animation is being caused by an unknown viral agent, something that can operate on a cellular level.. . This viral agent seems to be performing a function of mimicking life, but is not  actually a living creature. While the body is still decaying, it appears to be at a greatly slowed rate.. . The zombie seems to be a semi-living creature, but notice, the zombie only attacks living humans. Once the person is dead, and reanimated, the zombies no longer feed on that body.. . What I would postulate is this, while the zombies are experiencing a form of pseudo-life, their bodies are not in fact living, they are no longer producing any of the chemicals or by-products that a living body would create. What can be assumed is that, it is not so much a craving for living flesh, but for the by-products and chemicals that a living body can produce, the zombies can no longer produce, BUT the pseudo-life of their reanimated flesh, still has a need for these chemicals.. . The only place they could get these is from the tissues and blood of a living human, and that, these chemicals are no longer produced at death, and as the body dies, stops production, and the reanimation begins, the now pseudo-life zombie begins consuming these chemicals on it's own, and looses it's appeal as a source of "nourishment" for the other zombies.

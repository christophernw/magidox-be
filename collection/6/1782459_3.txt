It works like any postal system. Example I post a letter from Newport, South Wales, UK to California. I write on the full address, then I put in the post box, from then which it is taken to the local sorting office where it is sorted and taken to the main sorting office, where it is then sorted and taken to the Airport, where it is flown to New York, from there it is sent to the Local Sorting Office in California to which the letter is addressed, then then postman delivers it to the Addresses the next morning, puts it through the letter box.

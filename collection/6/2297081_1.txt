After Martin Luther helped lead the campaign to reform the Roman Catholic church, a new religious group sprang into existance: the protestants.. . Unlike the Roman Catholics of the time, protestants believe that scripture and scripture alone is THE authority in scriptural matters. Also, the protestants do not have a central figurehead to declares truths and untruths, like the Roman Catholics do through the Pope.. . Protestantism also holds many groups, or, denominations to it's name. There's the PCRA, the CRC, the URC, the RCA, the Lutherans, the Baptist... It's quite the list.. . To sum it up, protestants are bible-believing Christians who hold to a set of ideas and doctrines apart from the Roman Catholic church.

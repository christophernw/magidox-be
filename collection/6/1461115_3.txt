When light strikes the eye it enters the lens of the eye at an angle.  Because the index of refraction of the lens is different from air, the light is bent, or changes direction at the air-lens interface.  The lens is shaped in such a way that all light coming from a particular point of an object is bent at the lens so that it falls on the same point in the retina.  The light from all points of the object are thus "mapped" into points on the retina, giving a focussed image.

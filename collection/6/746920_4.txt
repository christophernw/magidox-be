put an aspirin on the wart and wrap duct tape (silver furnace tape) completely around the wart. Make sure there is absolutely no way air can get to it.. remove it after 7 days and check to see if the wart is still there, if so repeat for another 7 days with fresh tape and aspirin. If you're allergic to aspirin then skip it and wait 14 days before unwrapping the tape.. . Another remedy that wors better and doesn't make you look silly for a week.. is find a man who is the 7th son (meaning he has 6 older brothers) and have him 'rub away' the wart. All he has to do is rub his thumb over the wart for a few seconds.. when you forget about it, it'll be gone.. .   My two oldest boys had gotten warts all over their hands and I had a 7th son rub them off. About 6 weeks later, I had forgotten about it and went to take the boys to the doctor to get rid of them before school started, and the youngest one's warts were gone. The oldest didn't believe they'd be gone and they weren't but the youngest did believe. It really works. Another thing is go to your doctor and ask him or her to use crushed up blister beetle on the wart, it'll go away in about a week. Good luck

You MUST mention it to your superiors, otherwise you could be considered an accomplice or willingly trying to cover for your husband. They will need to ask the company's attorney how to proceed but I believe it should go something like this. The Company will send an official letter to the customer appoligizing for the infraction, and a new contract/purchase order or whatever form that needs to be signed with his actual signature. That's it, no fuss no muss.

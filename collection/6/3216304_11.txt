This isn't a high school wrestling match, it's a war!  An overwhelming show of force can definitely impress the enemy and get the message across. Superior technical force often bring about quicker enemy capitulation. On a global scale, it's the ultimate victory that leads to peace that counts. . . But just for the record, I assume your question comes from the way Zarqawi was captured. Well, we are fighting them on the ground everyday as well. How do you think so many of our guys are getting blown up and shot. It sure doesn't happen in an airplane.

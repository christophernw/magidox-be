Mercury expands a lot with a small change in temperature, which is what makes it easy to measure the change in temperature.  No one wants to try to read marks that are too close together.  The volume changes are very consistent along the temperature range, which is why the marks on the thermometer are the same distance from each other.  Mercury also does not stick to glass, otherwise there would be smears from the film of mercury on the glass, and the thermometer would be hard to read.  It is also a colored, not clear, liquid: easy to see.

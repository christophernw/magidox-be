Here's how it is in PA.  For the general residential appraiser's certification you must take 120 classroom hours related to residential and general appraisals.  Then you must find someone to apprentice with and complete a minimum of 24 months (2,500 total hours) of appraisal experience.  Then you sit for the state exam.

7 Storey Mountain by Thomas Merton.  I'm not religous but I found Merton's descriptions of his search for meaning in his own life to be amazingly inspiring, even though his belief system is not my own.  He manages to speak about his chosen religion without making the reader feel as though they are lacking or less for having other beliefs.

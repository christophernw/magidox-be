aren't we at days of revelation?? indeed we are.. for satan too have increased his nations and his numbers.. for it has been this long war between God and the Devil from the beginning of the world.. for it works of our God's hands that was taken and stripped from him,,  for we live by his 10commandments until the end of our earth,, and for that reason "thou shalt not committ adulteries"..  LOVE YOURSELF AND RESPECT YOUR BODY FOR IT IS THE TEMPLE OF GOD.. for the devil want us to love this world,, and destroy all temples of God,, until we are all done from this world.. for the wage of sin is "DEATH"

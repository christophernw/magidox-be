Although there are some very good answers given, there is one thing that has been overlooked. That being the hydrostatic blood pressure.. induced by pronounced body tension,  with the resultant increase in blood pressure. This can be the result of a hard sneeze or when rising to fast. The hydrostatic pressure may be slow to respond to get the blood pressure back to normal.. often associatated with flashing bubbles in the visual field. If this is persistant, should be checked by your physician.

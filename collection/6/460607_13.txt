Milk is said to be bad for your health for a number of different reasons - everything from allergies to weight problems etc. It also plays a big role in childrens behavioural problems.. . People tend to think that milk is the best form of calcium because of the media and how they were bought up. . . However, because of the amount of protein it contains - the body is not able to digest it, and as a result, any protein or calcium in the milk goes to waste since the body cannot use it properly. The large amount of protein also causes blood imbalance, and as a result of high milk intake, the excess protein causes blood to extract calcium from the bones in order to balance out the protein and calcium levels. So it in fact helps cause osteoporosis instead of prevent it. . . Also, breastmilk is the only form of milk that babies should be fed.

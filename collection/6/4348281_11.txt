These are images from the dragon-myth origins of the Leviathan mythology in Hebrew religion.  As I mentioned in an earlier question of yours, Leviathan is in part derived from the Goddess/Sea-Dragon Tiamat in earlier Sumerian mythology.. . The representation of Leviathan in Job underscores his association with Satan in Judeo-Christian mythology.  Leviathan represents the evil, destructive, or antisocial dimension of the natural world, the potential for destructive power in nature.  Not suprisingly, Leviathan is closely tied with "mythic defamation" (turning the gods of other religions into demons in one's own) of nature deities of the elements (Sea, Air, Fire, and Earth--all of which appear in the Isaiah and Job accounts, if you look).

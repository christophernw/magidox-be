Actually, DLP technology is better than LCD...The DLP will offer better "black levels" (this means that shadows and the bars at the top and bottom of your "cinema scope" movies will appear black and NOT gray)...Some LCD projectors are trying to correct this problem with an IRIS over the light bulb to reduce the amount of brightness from scene to scene...Also the newer DLPs with the FASTER spinning color wheels deliver SLIGHTLY better color...But as for SHARPNESS and DETAIL both projectors are evenly matched.

Tell me what he did that made you feel he is an a$$hole.. . It depends on age and experience...at a young age with little experience most employees feel their managers ARE a$$holes...but later you figure out they are not. . If you are a bit older and wiser...he just may be an a$$hole...I myself recently had one of those to deal with...it was brutal, I dreaded going into the office.. . Tell us what exactly is going on so that we can give you a clearer answer.

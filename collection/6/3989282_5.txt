I think that everybody should at least think about what they are going to do for some one else in order to stay alive. It is the most beautiful thing a person can do.....Just about everyone can live on half a liver, it does grow back, but someone that needs a full liver transplant must come from a deceased person. Just think how good it will feel if you can give live to another human being.. Good Luck and Good Health

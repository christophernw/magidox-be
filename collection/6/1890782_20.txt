First off believing in God or a higher power has nothing to do with religion. Religion is man made, and as we all know mankind is not perfect therefore neither is his version of any religion.. . Religion is wonderful if it is to worship God, but when it dictates actions of human beings based upon scripture also written by men who we are to believe were inspired by Jesus it still will carry their prejudices and life's paradigms. . . I have always had faith in God, because to dismiss god is arrogant. It means we think that we are the Davine power of the universe and I don't believe that. . . I think living a life of compassion, caring and helping fellow man is a spiritual experience. Reading scripture and going lockstep to things that don't make sense is not my kind of religion. . . Remember more people have died in wars in the name of a religion than all other conflicts.

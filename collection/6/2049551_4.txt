Well, personally, I would say pray for wisdom just as King Solomon did. If Jehovah chooses to grant you wisdom then you can help yourself and every one around you..   On the other Hand I think miracle days ended with the death pf John the last Apostle on the Island of Patmos..   So no miracles, well, find one person to be kind to and tell that person they are obliged to pass KINDNESS on to the next person.  Maybe some day a stranger will be kind to me and I will owe that to you starting the trend!

I would not compare "The Da Vinci Code" with "Last Temptation"...I think totally different types of movies.. . Whether you think the premise of Da Vinci Code is fact or fiction...the story is entertaining.  I happen to enjoy religious based thillers.  Do I think the church as keeping Satan's son in a module in the basement of a small church in New York (1987's Prince of Darkness)...NO.. . Is the church(es) so paranoid about people's faith that this is such a concern.  I guess so.  The also tried to stop the printing press, supress the Renaissance.. . I have a very strong faith...I just don't get the concern.  Also, what if Jesus was married to Mary?  I don't think that would lessen the fact that he is the Son of God.

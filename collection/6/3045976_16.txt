What is peace to you?  The absense of war?  If so, ur wrong.  Many countries are not  at war, yet still thousands are being killed there.   In N. Korea,  millions have died in consentration camps,  yet the world remains silent.  Where are the protests for that?  In somalia, the sudan, and Darfur  millions are being killed systematically, and war has not been declared.   Where is the public outcry?   In Russia , the baltics, and many asian coutries such as Thailand, women are sold into slavery  and forced to work in brothels, and where is the protest?  I hear silence?   Why?  Because those places have nothing to do with the USA.   If they did Bush would be blamed for it all, like the world tries to blame him for many things which he has no control over.  . . I dont see peace as being the absense of war.  The world is full of evil men (and women) that seek to destroy others,  and this will never change.   So if one day there is no country fighting a formal war against another, dont think for a second that the world will truly be at peace.   The human organs will still be harvested in China,  the taiwanese will still be threatened by the chinese,  the terrorists will still kill innocent people and threaten the world,  children will still be hunted by sexual perverts,  and people will still blame america for everything they can.  Thats just the way it is.

Once you start needing to wear glasses, you'll understand! Squinting changes the visual field and makes seeing things easier. If you have excellent vision, squinting doesn't help.. . Just a few days ago I was driving with my son, and he does not need glasses. I asked him if he could see the shapes of the trees far up on the distant mountains, and he said yes, and that on some days, when the atmospheric conditions were just right, he could see even further, and more clearly.  Me, even with glasses on, if I squint, those distant trees become more clear.

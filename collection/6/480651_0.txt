A powerful spell that women are put under about once every month, which gives them the strength of an ox, the stability of a Window's OS, and the scream of a banshee. Basically, man's worst nightmare.. . OMFG! SHE HAS PMS!!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!! *explosions and screams*. . (this is a joke.). hahahah. . . . . . Some estimates say that PMS occurs in 75% of women of reproductive age during their lifetime. A more severe form of PMS is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). This occurs in about 5% of women. Both are characterized by symptoms of mood swings, depression, anxiety and irritability that occur prior to menses, usually in the two week period between ovulation and menses. It is often accompanied by physical symptoms such as bloating and cramping.

Just so everyone knows, many gases have color (ex. chlorine gas is green).  You do not need pigments to have color.  Most things do not contain pigments like plants do.  Look up at the sky.  What color is it?  It's blue because of how the light from the sun bends as it travels through the atmosphere, which is made up of air.  The reason you don't see most gases has more to do with just the density.  Have you ever seen a high pressure container?  It has a higher density than a regular pressure container, but the inside does not look any different.  Color can come from many different sources.  Compounds can absorb light, transmit light, reflect light, and emit light.  The color depends on the wavelenght, which is associated with the amount of energy of the light.  The reason you don't see the air in front of you has a lot to do with the fact that reflects white light, which our eye perceives to be colorless.

Intelligent design can be taught in schools, but it should not be taught in the science classroom.  It has nothing to do with science.  The theory called 'intelligent design' isn't some kind of new revelation.  It's based on one of the oldest (and least robust) philosophical arguments for the existence of God called the teleological argument.. So it can be taught in the philosophy classroom... though you don't find many philosophy courses in K-12 education.

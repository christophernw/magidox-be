Almost all question are retro unless you have truly accepted Jesus as savior. It then all becomes very clear as the Holy Spirit teaches you preceipt upon preceipt. . God never intended the unsaved to understand much more then the need to have it. It is necessary to take the first steep on faith and then God will renew your mind and give you the ability to learn from there. This is why God wants you as your are. You cannot change to what you need to with our Him first being in your life to guide you towards that goal. Even then you can expect to sin because it is your natural mind that is still trying to run the show. Once Jesus is firmly setting on the throne of your heart then satan will eventually get the picture.

dont make eye contact, fidgety, or nervous acting... (like foot tapping, shifting from one foot to the other etc...). usually when someone lies to you they look away such as looking down, turn their head, or look past you, like they are looking behind you instead of looking you in the eye.... some people can look you in the eye and lie to you, but notice that the facial expression is subtly different.. maybe they "turn white" around the outside of their mouth, or their face turns red, or they look you in the eye and tell the lie, then quickly look away

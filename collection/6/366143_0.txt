Dogs usually bark because: a) strangers in the area; b) they are hungry or thirsty; c) because they are lonely. . Keep in mind that doggies love to be loved and to be treated as part of the family.. that means talking to them.. playing with them, etc and if you do not pay any attention to them, then they are lonely and they bark

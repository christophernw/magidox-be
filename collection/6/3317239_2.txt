Call the theaters in the city where you live and ask for recommendations on an acting school for your daughter.. . The biggest expense for an acting career is training.. Your daughter needs experience before she gets an agent.  Most agents represent actors that have acting experience.. . Don't worry about auditions!  She is not ready.  She must prepare her acting craft with professional acting lessons, she should also know how to sing, dance (tap/jazz/ballet).  She should study acting for the next 10-12 years.  It takes many years of training to become an actor, it is not something one does in three months.  Is she committed to the lengthy training?  . Acting training is not cheap.  . . Many actors were performing from 1st grade through college and grad school.  It's a long and winding road.  You must make sure your daughter has the stamina to get into the acting industry, it's difficult to be seen by the right people.  Many actors work as waiters instead of actors.  . . Your first step is to find the best acting school, in the city where you live, for your daughter. . . I am a former talent agent.  Your daughter is not ready to compete with professional child actors.  Enroll her in a good acting school, so she can compete with others in her age range.

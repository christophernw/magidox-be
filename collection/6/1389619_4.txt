well you have to break this question down a bit.  an enemy is an identified memeber of an opposing force.  idetified means you see a distinct uniform or emblem thats is only used by the opposing force.  if this distinction can't be made the person is a "non friendly".  if the person is an enemy you need to distinguish weather this person has a weapon or not.  if theres no weapon he is a "non combatant" and vise versa.  a civilian on the battlfield is also considered a non combatant.. a POW is a person that has been imprisoned by an enemy force and is being held for interegation.

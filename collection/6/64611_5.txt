you can't! see, your friend has a mind of its own...unless he's a robot, then you can maybe program him to leave drugs but then he's not so there's nothing you can do to make him stop if he doesn't want to. there's a reason why he's into drugs. Maybe he has a really big problem and he feels neglected or something. talk to him, listen to him. all you can do for him is let him know that you're there for him.

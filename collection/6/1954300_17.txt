Americans generally have little need to learn another language. . . Why bother when you live in a country that is larger than Europe and English is all but universally understood in in all 50 states? . . Further, even if traveling abroad, English is so ubiquitous, at least in major urban areas, that it is usually sufficient. Indeed, I've often seen Europeans for whom English is not their native language, communicating with each other in English because they have no other language in common.. . In places like India or Nigeria where there are hundreds of languages spoken in a single country, English provides a common language.

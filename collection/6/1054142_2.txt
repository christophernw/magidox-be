Funny you should ask.when i was a child my folks ran a bar and we lived upstairs.They would send Teddy the drunk up to baby sit us .he told us funny stories to try and get us to sleep and always ended with so hows about them apples!This is the first time ive heard that or read that in about 35 years or so.Brings back memories.

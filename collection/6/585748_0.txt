As a Social Worker, I am aware of homelessness. It can happen to any social strategy.. caused by losing your job and income.. caused by high hospitals bills or other violent impacts in a personal life.. . it can be caused by people who have Psychiatric problems, but do not have access to proper health care insurance, hence therefore they do not have adequatley access to proper medical care.. The circumstances are plent of them. It can be very easily to get into becoming homelessness.. . I once was close to be one of these statistics. But I was lucky and got out of it. . How can we prvent it? Better paying jobs, better access to health care insurance, better access to hospital care, . taking care of one another.

Every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force directed along the line connecting the two. This force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them:. . F is the magnitude of the (repulsive) gravitational force between the two point masses. G is the gravitational constant. m1 is the mass of the first point mass. m2 is the mass of the second point mass. r is the distance between the two point masses. . . Assuming SI units, F is measured in newtons (N), m1 and m2 in kilograms (kg), r in metres (m), and the constant G is approximately equal to 6.67 × 10−11 N m2 kg−2 (newtons times metres squared per kilogram squared). . . It can be seen that the repulsive force F is always negative, which means that the net attractive force is positive. (This sign convention is adopted in order to be consistent with Coulomb's Law, where a positive force means repulsion between two charges.)

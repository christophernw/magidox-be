The ideal gas concept assumes that gases are hard and rigid spheres that have NO intermolecular interactions.  The gas laws can be developed on this basis.  . . Real gases (some of them anyway) can be deformable and often have intermolecular interactions (water vapor is a perfect example).  A correction factor is sometimes necessary when dealing with real gases at higher temperatures and pressures.  The temperature and pressure where this factor is required depends on the gas.

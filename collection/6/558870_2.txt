if you're in a hurry, put it on 500 and watch closely (check every five minutes, spoon juices over them to avoid charring). if not, put it on 400 and check every 15 minutes or so, still spooning juices over them. a little paprika will help the browning...how small are they cut...little pieces go quicker, big pieces take longer...if they're with meat just leave them in there until you're damn sure the meat is done. the veggies will be okay.

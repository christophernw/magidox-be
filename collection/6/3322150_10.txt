I found religion, religion didn't find me.. . I went on a self-exploration and pieced together things that made logical, rational, reasonable sense to me by learning about and exploring all kinds of different spiritual views. I created my own religion out of what I found to be true for ME, not anyone else.. Then a friend introduced me to Wicca. Wicca has very little dogma, and the dogma it does have coincides with what I put together myself. Wicca also takes a lot of study, and I'm still studying today. It allows my religious views to consistently grow and change as I consistently grow and change (and learn more). It just works for me.. . Everyone is different, and should find religion instead of letting it find them. Religion is what you make of it. Don't just take people's words for things, or believe in something "because he/she told me to." Believe in something because it makes too much sense to you for you not to stand behind it. If there are so many out there, why settle for the first one you find? LEARN; it's why we're all here.

They are bacteria which are capable of producing spores under unfavourable conditions of growth ( nutrient scarcity, high temperature etc.)these spores remain inside the cell i.e the organism itself and therefore it is called as the ENDOSPORE and the organism is called as endospore bearing bacteria.eg of such orgs are Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium species.The endospores can be central, terminal or sub-terminal in position.The part of the cell that contains the spore appears to be a little bulging.

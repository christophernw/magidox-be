you ignorant people,. the Confederate flag doesnot stand for salvery. No, it stands for our southern heritage. It stands for people fighting for what they belive in. Now, I'm not saying that Slavery is OK. In fact, I think Slavery is wrong. But I support the Confederate Flag, because it stands for my heritage.

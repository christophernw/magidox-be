Yes, Spiritual growth is not only important but necessary. We don't want to be baby Christians all our lives. God want's us to grow and to mature into strong men and women of God. He can better use us that way. Think of a human child, now would you want that child to remain a child all their life? I would hope not. They need to grow and need to learn how to live and learn, well, the same thing holds true for Christians in their spiritual walk.

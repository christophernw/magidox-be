Hi! I would like to answer that question as a male. Femininity is largely determined by the kind of woman that a man is attracted to. For me, I would rather see a woman neatly, and smartly dressed in a skirt and high heels and panty-hose, than naked!.      I am sure that most men like a clean cut woman, who is pret, fun to be with, and not overtly provocative. Sex is in the eye of the beholder. I personally like a woman who loves to be, and feel feminine. I like demure women, I like spiritual, and respectful women. In short, I want women who are non-judgemental, and not driven to gossip.

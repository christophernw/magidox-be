Have you got a dog, cat? If you are getting wypers or "s" looking squiggly lines in your pic, you may have "chew" marks in your cable some place. Just got a Yorkie puppy and he crapped my cable, bit threw the foil and so getting UHF interference from local TV. "Wrapped" bad spot with Reynolds wrap and taped it with electrical tape and now back to good pics again. All else fails - call cable co.

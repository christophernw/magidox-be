You need a pretty rigorous training and diet. . . Diet is low fat/ low cal/ low carb and rather restrictive, but once you have motivation, you can stick to it. . . Find a trainer, who actually did train a movie star you want to look similarly to. Of course take your body type under consideration, for example if you're a "ruler" there is no fitness plan/ diet in the world that will make you curvy. Surgery only. . . Go to local modeling agencies, it's the easiest way to determine if you have what it takes. . . best of luck and if you win, post pictures!!!. ~K

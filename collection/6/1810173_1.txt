Ah, pooh.  Wonderful thing. . . I suppose. . .. . Anyhow.  If you're eating the pooh or otherwise ingesting it, then it depends on what kind of organisms are in there.  Some poop contains parasites and/or their eggs which can infect you - some of them can burrow out of your intestines, go to your brain and kill you.  Pretty lethal.. . If your stepping on it, well, dogs have hookworms that aren't infectious until they're in the soil for a week or so.  If you step on an infectious worm it can burrow through your skin, but it usually doesn't kill you.  If your immune system is working like it should, it usually doesn't make it too far.. . Now, if you don't pooh, meaning you're constipated, then pooh can back up into your cecum and get into your appendix.  This is one cause of appendicitis - and appendicitis can kill you.. . If you've got a perforrated colon, then the normal bacteria that are in pooh can get out and infect otherwise sterile body parts.  This causes an infection and can kill you if you ignore the symptoms and don't get treatment for it.. . OK, back to parasites.  Animals (birds, beavers, dogs, cats, even other people) can carry parasites in their digestive tracts.  If these animals pooh in water, and then you drink the water then you can become infected as well.  These parasites can do various harm depending on where in your body they settle and what kind of functions they interupt.. . More of this story - don't eat pooh.  Don't drink water with pooh in it.  Pooh on a regular schedule.

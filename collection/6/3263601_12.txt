How do you figure they lied to him. they said at 17 he wouldn't be sent and they lived up to their end of the agreement. . why did he join? to get a government paid for education.. well guess what sometimes they call in their markers for that free education, it usually happens during war time. and anyone who enlists in the marine corps and doesn't think that they will get called into active combat has no clue about the history of the Marine corps.. on a personal note I am the Father of an active duty Marine who is on his 3rd tour of Iraq. the main reason he's been sent a 3rd time is because of young men like your nephew, . the real reason he doesn't want to go is he is scared that's natural. But this isn't a game and there will be severe consequences if he goes AWOL. It will be a decision that will dictate his entire life until he gets caught. and there is no statute of limitations on Desertion and that's what it will be not AWOL.

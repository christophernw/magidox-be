This time-honored tradition began in France in the mid-18th century with the Marquis De Fluer. The marquis was fond of a particularly exotic Mediterranean dish that, at the time, was taking the French aristocracy by storm-live gerbil. This dish was traditionally prepared by shaving the gerbil and brushing it with a light coating of olive oil and spices. The diner would then pick up the entire gerbil and stuff it into his/her mouth, the olive oil providing lubricant. However, in the Marquis' case, he was a long-time sufferer of halitosis, so much so that when his Greek manservant, Alexopolous, tried to drop the gerbil into the Marquis's mouth, it would writhe and wriggle in disgust at the fetid stench rising from his throat. Alexopolous, exhibiting a shrewdness known to the Greeks, had the idea of placing a few pieces of greens into the Marquis' mouth in order to entice the gerbil into his mouth. Voila! Success for the Marquis, and, over time, the creation of a delicious and satisfying dining tradition for all of us in the west.

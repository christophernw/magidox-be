The proposition is a distortion. It implies that the preexisting condition is neutral and destiny is determined by a choice, which if you get wrong you are punished.. . A more biblical representation of our condition is that we are all destined for punishment and currently under punishment (John 3:36). God's wrath abides on our world, our cultures and individuals. But there is an escape, Christ came to procure the escape. The Gospel is good news, because it is the message of our escape from God's wrath.. . To state the gospel from the negative is a more modern affectation, because we in the west tend to emphasize that everything is 'pretty good.' A clear look both inside of us and outside of us indicates that things are not good at all. We were made for better, we were made to be better. It reconciliation with our creator that begins our process of becoming what we  were meant to be.

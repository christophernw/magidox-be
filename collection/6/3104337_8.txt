one of my cats actually does throw a party!. when i come home, i find things knocked down, bags in the pantry ripped open. i even came home to a water bottle that was gnawed into (she doesn't have claws). i have even found wine bottles half gone, and had to kick out her d.j (no, just kidding!). but yea, i'm convinced they really do let loose once you leave the house.

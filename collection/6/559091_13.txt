Not all Christians are vegetarians. I am a Seventh-day Adventist (branch of Christianity) and many people in this denomination are vegetarian. We believe that God never gave humans permission to eat meat. The only time was to Noah after the flood, but only until the vegetation grows back. Thats to the best of my knowledge. =) God Bless

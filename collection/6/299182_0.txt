Start with your local SPCA or animal shelter.  Usually they have a trap and release program.  They trap the cat, spay or neuter it, then release it again.  That way, the feral cats don't get put to sleep, and they don't breed more feral cats.  To keep them from your own area, just don't feed them; they will hang out wherever there is food and water.  Make sure you don't have any leaky faucets outside, they may be drinking there.

I believe it is Italy. Although Marco Polo travelled to China and discovered noodles, which were around first and took the idea back to Italy and that launched spaghetti (a type of pasta). Other Italian foods are Pasta (you've mentioned), Lasagne and Pizza (which was designed for the Queen at the time, although there is no monarchy now, there was when Pizza was first designed), the "Margharita" style was the first one made which was meant to be the Italian flag, red = tomatoes, yellow(white) = cheese and green = oregano. Hope that helps you.

Look at the mascots. The elephant is big, capable of pulling a load by itself. Since the elephant pulls the load alone the elephant alone decides the distribution of the bounty to the commonwealth.  The elephant, being large and cumbersome, often crushes those at the bottom, as all the weight is distributed at the top,  The donkey works with a team to pull the same load.  Thus a wider distribution of wealth, and, since there is many, if one falls by the wayside, there are others to carry the load, unhampered by the small loss. Who the donkeys and the elephants are is decided first by their party, who spend scads of money to get their interest in, but also, as a party will spend the same amount to get them out.  As with Lieberman who has been doing the "monica" with the elephants even though the donkeys paid his way to the floor. Say nite-nite "Lie"berman.

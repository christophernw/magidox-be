I think that because of the movies and television our young people tend to see these characters as hero's. They do not understand that the steroe types are bad influences and that drugs and weapons play a very large part in todays society. We can as parents all influence are children and grand children with positive things to do and the right type of movies to watch, things that will help expand there minds and we need to keep christianity in our homes always.

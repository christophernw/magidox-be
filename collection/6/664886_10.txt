The primary answer is because we feel threatened, (in terms of liberty, not by your imaginary superdaddy). . . Don't believe me?  I'll back it up with proof.. . The Public Expression of Religion Act has already passed the House, and is now in the Senate for a vote (see ref below).  If it passes, it changes the law in the following way:. . Currently, if you sue the government for a First Amendment violation and you win the case, the government has to pay for your court fees.  That means if your freedom of speech, freedom to own a gun, freedom of religion, etc... is violated by the government, you can sue them for free (assuming you win).. . If the PERA law passes, the same will hold true for all First Amendment rights EXCEPT religion.  The means if a public school decides to make its classes recite parts of the Bible (or Koran, or Sha'dith) every morning, the people who feel their rights are violated have to spend their own money to take the school to court.  And even if they are right (and they WIN the case), they STILL don't get reimbursed.  However, if the government says you can't own a gun and you sue, you will get reimbursed.  Apparently the right to own a gun is more important than the right to freedom of religion.. . Does this make any sense?  No.  It's a way of using the law to stop people from suing for religious reasons -- which means it allows the government to abuse that right.. . This is why atheists (and other minority religions) "go after" Christians.  It is because Christians are trying to make it illegal to be anything but Christian!. . Quick fact:  Right now, atheists can't legally hold public office in 7 states.. . Want more information?  Check out this 5-minute video: http://youtube.com/watch?v=w4fQA9mt-Mg

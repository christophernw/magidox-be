The term "Jew" is derived from the religion they are said to practice...Most people of hebrew descent practice Judaism....The people who practice this religion are said to be "Jewish"...Shorten that to "jew" and you begin to understand...For the most part when we shorten the name of any significant person or group it's done in insult...Don't believe me? Call someone of hebrew descent a "heeb" and see what happens.

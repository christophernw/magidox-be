Oh, I know exactly what you mean. The first time I got a video recorder and my husband took a film of me when I wasn't looking, I was horrified when I watched it. I suddenly saw myself as other people saw me. Not just the front view that I'd seen for 26 years in a Mirror, but the full 360 degree shots. I looked awful and my head was all a weird shape. Not to mention my body! I'm gradually getting used to it, but it still comes as a shock when I see myself walking along! Scary!

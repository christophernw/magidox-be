Hi!. . I'm Scandinavian, so let me help you.. . First of all Scandinavia includes Norway, Sweden and Denmark. NOT Finland or Iceland!. . The first thing we have in common is the language. We all speak different languages, but we still understand each other.. We also share the same customs, culture and traditions.. . Remember that Norway was once a part of Denmark then Denmark gave it to Sweden, but Norway has been an independent country since 1814.. . We all have ancestors that were vikings.. We all enjoy beer.. We have a lot of blonds with blue eyes.. We are all very rich countries.. We some of the best chefs and restaurants in the world.. We all have a king or a queen.. We all have a cross in our flags.. . It is the language that brings us together and the act that our royal families are so tight. Also, we have Swedish and danish TV stations in Norway and the other way around, so we keep us connected

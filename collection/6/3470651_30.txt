SO MANY FALSE OR EVEN STUPPID ANSWERS UNTIL NOW !!!!. . ===================================. ===================================. ===================================.         THE GOOD ANSWER IS:. ===================================. ===================================. . . . Static energy appears when you wear plastic clothes and touch/rub plastic surfaces (like chairs, car seats, and floor).. When you touch a metal surface that IT IS CONNECTED to the ground (and only then) all the energy accumulated in you discharge suddenly.. This can be painful.. . To get rid of that static energy/charge you should discharge it slowly.. How? It is very simple:. Go to a shop that sell electronic components (parts) and buy a resistor of 100 KOhm.. It is really cheap, something like 3-10 cents (American dollar cent).. . If you are asked about the power of that resistor, your answer is: it doesn't matter. Anyway I recommend you a resistor of at least 1 Watt because it a little bit larger (2 or 3 centimeter long) and it is more difficult to loose it.. It the power of that resistor is under 1W it will be only 1 cm long and you might loose it soon in your pockets.. . THE IDEA is to keep on head/terminal of the resistor in your hand while touching the grounded object with the other end for 3-4 seconds.. This will dissipate your energy slowly and painless.. . If you still got shocked try to buy another one much bigger, something like 500 Kohm up to 1 MOhm.. . newfedra@yahoo.com. www.BionixWallpaper.com. . ===================================. ===================================. ===================================. ===================================. .. .. .. PS: as somebody mentioned above, a bracelet might work but only in time. If you accumulate energy very quickly, then it is useless.. Also TO PREVENT this problem you should buy an anti-static spray from a clothes store. But it won't last very long and might smell bad after the perfume is gone.. . . . Even e better idea: wrap a thin wire around your place/desk in invisible places.. Connect this wire to the ground through the resistor described above.. Grounded things in your house: the heating system, the water pipe, some doors.. . When you sit down you will touch that wire and the energy will be discharged slowly al the time.. The wire must not be wrapped in it's protective plastic, rubber or paint.. Buy 10 meters o unwrapped copper wire (also extremly cheap).

Most archeologists live by teaching or doing research.  There are very few good paying jobs out there.  Of course, if you can write really well, you can submit grant applications and might get lucky.. . Just my advice, but I'd listen to your mother... Get a degree in a major where you can find a job when you graduate, and minor in archeology as a hobby.

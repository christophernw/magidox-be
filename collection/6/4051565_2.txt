The best way to get people to like you is to just be genuinely nice to others. Hand out complements like there is no tommorrw. People love to hear nice things about themselves, and when you do they will like you alot more. Being popular isn't about having the best clothes or being the prettiest, it is about being so that people like you and want to hang with you.

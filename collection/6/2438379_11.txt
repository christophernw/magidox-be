The landlord can do much more. It is the landlord's job to specify which areas are for your storage and hers, which parts of the patio/backyard are for you/her, and what she is "entitled" to and not. . . If she behaves in an "unruly" or "scary" manner, be certain to document each incident with a description, date, and time. Note if you have any witnesses. . . I would suggest trying to work out a timetable for the backyard. Perhaps you get it on MWF and she can have it TThS or something. . . The garage and parking space are definitely up to the landlord to explain to her what is and isn't hers though.

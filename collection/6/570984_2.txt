I'm really not shure why its called yahoo, but I looked up the definition. Here it is:. . n 1: not very intelligent or interested in culture [syn: yokel, rube, hick, hayseed, bumpkin, chawbacon] 2: one of a race of brutes resembling men but subject to the Houyhnhnms in a novel by Jonathan Swift [syn: Yahoo]. . P.S. I don't know what that means

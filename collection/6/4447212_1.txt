The band decided to split after Elton John suggested that their popularity was decreasing and that they should concentrate on their solo careers. They did so after releasing their Best Of Blue greatest hits compilation in 2004, which contained a few new tracks such as "Curtain Falls", "Get Down On It" and "Only Words I Know".

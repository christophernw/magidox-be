take some Isopropyl alcohol in an eye dropper, grab a kleenex, tilt your head and put the alcohol in the ear with the water. Then..keeping your head tilted, place the Kleenex over your ear and gently press down, then quickly tilt your head the other way and let the pressure off the Kleenex...the water and alcohol should both drain out...i swim a lot and it always works for me...though sometimes you might have to do it twice

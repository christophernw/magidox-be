In the Airforce, the PFT (Physical Fitness Test) is very different than in the Army (APFT).  You don't run, but instead ride the cycle.  You don't do sit-ups but instead crunches.  These exercises are much less stressful on the body, while still as benefitial to the health.  Worry more about academics in the Air Force and physical strength in the Army.

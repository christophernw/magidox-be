Here's the best one I ever had: Somehow, while working for Texaco Exploration & Production, I wanted to do something for vacation. I didn't have much money but it was the time when my kids would visit their Dad. So, I was wondering around on the 'net and I found the Bora Bora archaeological dig thru the University of Hawaii. So, I bought a plane ticket to Hawaii and then I changed out for Bora Bora. I was delighted with my job. For a plane ticket cost, I was fed three times a day, worked on the dig at the instruction of archaeologists, had a place to say, a group of new friends, and the sea by night.

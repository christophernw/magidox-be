More then likely you have alot waste in your tank and hence this has created perfect conditions for a bacteria bloom so big that it now clouds your water. . I wouldn't be surprised you had an abundent level of ammonia...which would explain the mortality rate. Change your filter if you have a power filter (one that hangs on the side of the tank) and do a 15% water change every day until the water clears up.  Reduce feedings to every other day and the food should only be enough to fit inside the eye of the fish.

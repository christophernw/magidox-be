Many electronics stores have a 'CD/DVD repair kit'.  It works by sanding or polishing the DVD with a very fine grit material.  It will actually remove some of the plastic on the DVD to return it to a readable state.  It will not work on deep scratches.  Once you have polished the DVD, put a protective cover on it so that if it gets scratched again, the cover can simply and easily be replaced.

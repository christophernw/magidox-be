Get your facts straight before shouting like a fool.. the Pope is always in simple clothes - White usually, unlike the bishops and the cardinals.. Only for celebrations is he dressed in fancy clothes - to celebrate the happy events of the church. The cardinals and bishops are like princes and ambassadors of the church and dress as such.. and pray tell us, what did Jesus dress like? and if you are using renaissance paintings as a refrence then you are even dumber then your question!

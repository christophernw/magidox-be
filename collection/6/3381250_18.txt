It's not the cause, but the result of years of hatred being bred in young blacks who have this victim mentality drummed into them at an early age and grow up thinking that their lot is because of White man and any act of crime, hate or what have you against any White person is somehow justified.  Since they feel justified, they feel no guilt about what they do and actually are aghast when anyone refers to them as racists, bigots or perpetrators of hate crimes.. . This cycle just feeds on itself resulting in apathy, hate, criminality and finally, prison.  . . You'll know a black racist easily if you hear something like "You can't be White and be in THIS neighborhood" or "They won't listen to you because you're White" and not give a second thought to what they've just said.  . . Listen to people like Thomas Sowell, Ward Connerly, Clarence Thomas, Condoleeza Rice, even Bill Cosby and ask them what White person held them back.. . That's why the solution to the problem must come from within.  I'll give you step one:  Stop the hate... step two:  Focus on similarities and not differences... step three:  Obey the law... and even step four:  Finish high school at least.. . They also have to learn that Whites are not racists, and those few who might be are just that and focus on people as individuals by the way they act and not as a group by what they are.

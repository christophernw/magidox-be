If you're in Australia and find any stores that will donate, please let me know.. Im doing the same thing by making Christmas gift bags for local disabled children and emailed big chain companies and I got one reply saying they wont bother donating samples as the 'amount' of gift bags im organising isnt enough to get their name out there, how pathetic! - its for a good cause and they just dont care.. some companies didnt even write back.. Hope you have better luck :)

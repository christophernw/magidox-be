Because we live in a society of traditions. Our ancestors who were religious celebrated it so we too celebrate it. I am religious though. Our political and law systems are also built on traditions. Plus I don't think anyone is going to cancel christmas because we all like getting presents , its a boost to the economy and if u did little children would cry.

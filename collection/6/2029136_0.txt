When populations become isolated from one another eventually their languages will develop differently to the point where they become mutually unintelligible. For example, in Roman times, the people of Italy (Italia) and Spain (Iberia) both spoke Latin but during the dark ages the populations drifted apart and they both developed separate languages which both retain similarities to latin and to one another but are two separate languages. Languages often develop when they come into contact with indigenous language and the languages of the colonizers and colonized are blended together. These are called pidgin language and are usually simplistic but can evolve into even more sophisticated Creole (like in Haiti where they speak French Creole) and can become their own language

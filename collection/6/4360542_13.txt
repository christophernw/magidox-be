This may sound funny, but when I read Romeo and Juliet, Brother Francis said that nothing can be completely good or completely bad, there is always some good in the bad and some bad in the good, and he compared it to the herbs he was picking, some can heal, but some can kill, it all depends on how you use it. It was also used in To Kill a Mockingbird, when Atticus explained that sometimes the Bible in the hand of one could be just as bad as a bottle of wiskey in the other. Some people could change something, anything into a weapon of destruction.. . These are other examples, or explainations if you read the whole thing, to why some people misuse or misinterpt their holy book of choosing into a reason to kill for their faith, but they are wrong, and using a good thing for a bad reason. It's really more, human error to the extreme.. . (I'd also like to mention that any crazy so called Christians that kill anybody for their faith, are NOT real Christians, sorta like how Hitler claimed to be a Christian for popular image, but he WASN'T!)

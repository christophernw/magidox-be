Why do you think Britain is not respected?  Because a stereotype about them is their bad teeth.  You should see what they say about Americans over there!  It's all in fun.  . . Also, all white Americans are NOT descendants of the British.  In fact, the largest European ethnic block in the US is German not British.  . . the Brits are very well respected aside from the comic stereotypes.  Have you forgotten for basically 200 years up to WWII, the British Empire spanned the globe?  India, the Middle East, parts of Asia and Africa, etc., all were colonized by the Brits?  Definitely respect the Brits.

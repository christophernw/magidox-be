Melmo has nailed it for you.  Another example might be that you own an expensive Steinway concert grand piano but your Home Owners Insurance policy covers only a small part of its value.  You may have it appraised and insure it for its full value using a rider on your original policy for an added premium.  You can do the same thing with expensive antiques or a large gun collection, etc.

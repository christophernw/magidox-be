Yes, gravitons are the theoretical particle that transmits the gravitational force.  We've found such a particle for the other three forces (like the photon for the electromagnetic force) so we assume one exists for gravity.  Gravity travels at the speed of light according to Einstein's theories and there has been nothing that disproves this.

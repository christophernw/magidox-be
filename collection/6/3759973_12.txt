There is a big difference between enjoying alchohol and enjoying beer.  Some people drink simply to get drunk.  Some like to drink in moderation to relax or become more sociable.  There are people who truly enjoy the flavor of the hopps (thats what makes the bitter taste) in beer.  Beer can be appreciated much like wine is.  There are many varieties, brewers, and flavors to sample.  I would say the majority of people just drink beer for its alchohol content.  They have no regard for how it tastes (that explains the popularity of beer like Budweiser) and only intend to get drunk.

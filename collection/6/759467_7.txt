These are subconsciousness thoughts that are usually drowned out in the reality of the day. For most people what they say are of no importance. For the most of the rest it is a waste of time trying to decipher and track these thoughts. And for that 1/100 of the percent that is left, an idea can be gleaned. Then there is a fifty/fifty chance that idea can be any good. Also for those that are extremely lonely this can only be bad news. Think of this as the primitive mind before consciousness. Kinda like the old model T in the barn, just go out and drive the new red convertible!

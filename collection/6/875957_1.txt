hey,previous answer by puppyfred is absolutely wrong.Infact symptoms depend on the type of parasites.some parasties cause malabsorption.e.g hookworm is one kind of parasite and it absorb iron from diet and cause iron deficiency anemia and one's feel weak and lethargic.similarly fish tape worm is another parasite and it absorb vit B12 and cause vit B12 def. anemia.some cause itching at anal area at night.But most of them  don't cause any symptom and remain unnoticed.some cause diarrrhea.AS puppyfred said,treatment is lomotil.Lomotil is symtomatic treatment for diarrhea(any kind of diarrhea).it does not erradicate the cause.Its proper treatment is anti parasitic like tablet Mebendazole 100mg twice a day for 3 days.it is effective against large no. of parasite.If u are not sure about worms and their types,then it is better to go for stool microscopy.It will identify those worms and also other associated conditions

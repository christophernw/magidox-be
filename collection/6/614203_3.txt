If you pay attention, it is the Democrat ads that are so uncivilized.  At least, they hold the majority in the uncivilized ad campaign.  It's because they don't want their own faults brought out it in open.  It's like that guy at work who no one likes because he is always pointing out downfalls of his co-workers so the boss doesn't see his faults.

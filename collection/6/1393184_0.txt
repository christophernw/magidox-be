During S-phase the DNA is replicated.  Each chromatid is copied making two identical sister chromatids, the chromosome.  . . During metaphase the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell.. . They separate during anaphase and the sister chromatids move to opposite sides of the cell, and the cell divides into two cells during telophase and cytokinesis.  . . Unless there were any errors in the DNA replication, each daughter cell has the same genetic makeup as the parent cell.  In most cases, if an error had occurred, the daughter cells are not functional and will die.

As part of my lecture on “How to be a Leader and not a Manager,” I always have to explain what you are there for in the first place.  What is the REAL purpose behind your job?  You are there to Evaluate (judge performance), Delegate (assign tasks), and Analyze (keep track of production).  None of this can be done if you don’t listen to your employees.  . . Your job is not to be the big tyrant on a power kick.  You are there to eliminate obstacles so your team can perform their jobs in the best way possible.  Again, you can’t knock down performance obstacles if you don’t listen to them and find out what those obstacles are.  . . The people you lead/manage can do their job without you.  Your job is to help them be more successful.  When your superiors see your people performing so well, they will know it is YOUR leadership that makes it possible.  When that happens, YOU get the next promotion.  . . Good luck and keep working for that corner office.

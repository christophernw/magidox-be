I think he is hiding from people for some reason.  At night he does not have to relate to others and can be alone.  I was much the same when young but didn't watch TV because then there was no TV.  Would go for long walks in the country and come home in the morning.  I know it was because I didn't want to be around other children because of the teasing and torment I received from the other kids.  I am a handy caped person and the young are cruel without meaning it.  Think about your brother and see if there is something that others would either shun or tease about.  He is hiding from people.

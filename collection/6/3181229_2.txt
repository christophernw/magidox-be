I am Muslim, and it is because Ramdan Is Over...But you asked a good question! :) . . We celebrate Ramadan once a year, for 30 days. This year it was from September 23rd to October 23rd. During those 30 days, we fast (dont eat, drink, have sex, or fight verbally or physically) from sunrise to sunset. We do this to learn something called "self restraint", which means that as human beings, we are born with impulses and it is natural to want instant gratification--but we fast to learn to control our animal-like impulses. . . At any rate, Ramadan is over, and for 3 days after October 23rd, we all had a big feast and big parties---in my area there was a big carnival for the children.  Ramadan will be here next year in September 2007.

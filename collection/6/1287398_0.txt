You should also post this in physics...seriously.. . "force" is a result of the equation of Speed x weight. . F = S x W. . My old martial arts teacher believed it was much easier to double speed of a punch than double the weight of an arm...but, in both cases they would result in double the force applied. I tend to agree...but come to think of it, I never really looked it up.. Regarding the muscle groups? Well, if speed is what you want, i would say anything that increases fast twitch muscles. Try this question in physics though. i bet you get some interesting responses.. . BTW- the first answer, re core is absolutely true. I forgot about that. Strong core REALLY lets you coil up and and release the punch explosively. But again, it still comes down to physics...

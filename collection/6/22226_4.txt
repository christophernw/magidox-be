It's for camouflage purposes. All adult penguins are countershaded; that is they are dark on their dorsal (back) surfaces and white on their ventral (underside) surfaces. The dark dorsal side blends in with the dark ocean depths when viewed from above. The light ventral side blends in with the lighter surface of the sea when viewed from below.. . The result is that predators or prey do not see a contrast between the countershaded animal and the environment.

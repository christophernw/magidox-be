guidelines for normal blood sugar are 80-110 ( on paper anyways). . diabetes is a very tricky disease and some people will run a little above the 110 number and their doctor will consider this normal (especially if the person is taking daily medications that can increase their sugar levels). . same goes with levels below the 80. as long as the level doesn't drop below 50-most doctors won't worry too much (medications can also lower sugar levels). . . your levels will change throughout the day depending on how often you eat and what you eat.. . hope this helps

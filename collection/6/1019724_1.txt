usually familial household exposure is the cause. . . the only way to find out if you got hcv through molestation (sexual intercourse where blood to blood tranmission occured) is to test the genotype of the two people in question.. . if the people in question both have, for instance 3a, it might be indicative via sexual intercourse, however, you have a higher chance of getting it by sharing a toothbrush or razor.. . if one person has 1a and the other 3b it would be impossible to correlate and accuse the other person of transmission as HCV is not known to skip or change genotype from one person to the next.. . keep in my hcv is only contracted when blood to blood transmission occures. (a person bled in intercourse and the other had an open wound). . you can get hcv just goind to the barbers or having a pedicure.. hcv corpuscles (found in semen and vaginal fluids) are 100% not transferrable and are not infectious.. . the outcome is dependent on genotype and mode of transmission. usually those that do not respond to antiviral chemotherapy have lymphatic involvement (as seen in many with genotypes 1a and 1b).

Perimeter is the distance around the figure (like the amount of fencing around a field), which you determine by adding all of the sides of of the shape together. Area is the amount of space within an object (like the amount of carpet on a floor), which you determine by various formulas, depending on the shape. For example, area of rectangle = length x width; area of circle = pi x radius squared; area of triangle = 0.5 x base x height; area of square = side x side

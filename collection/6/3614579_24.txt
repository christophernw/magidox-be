It is nice to let them in though. I dont like mine to be in at night when we r in bed. Maby try gettin a cat flap so it can come and go as it pleases. I want to get one put in cuz my cat is never happy. If he's out he wants 2 be in, and if he's in he wants 2 be out. I get fed up of havein to go to the door all the time.

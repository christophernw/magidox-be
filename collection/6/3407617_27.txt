I wouldn't say it's wrong, if you like it and are comfortable with it why not? I do think however, that putting a price for your body and sexual skill is degrading, because I think it should be done with love, for love not money and lust. Also, I do not enjoy being objectified, when I have sex I am merging with another soul, and I don't wish to merge with just anyone that's feeling horny regardless of whether I really like him. That's the way I feel about it personally, but I don't think it's necessarily "wrong" for everyone.. Also, when Mary Magdalene became close to Jesus she stopped prostituting herself so it's not a very good argument in your favour.

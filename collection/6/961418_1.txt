I read somewhere that if you clap really loud right behind his ears he'll turn around and stop what he's doing.  I read it in a magazine.  They said it will bother the dog and he'll realate humping to the bad sound and stop.. P.S. nutering him won't help because my dog is nutered and he still humps from time to time, however less since the clapping was employed

Low Carb.  You can lose 30 pounds if you really work hard!  I know this sounds crazy, but I lost 30 pounds in 25 days because all I had was meat (with no sauce), green veg., salad (go really easy on the dressing, but have whatever dressing you want), sugar free jello, alittle peanut butter, sugar free drinks, and water. . NO bread, pasta, croutons on salad, rice or sweets (at all...NO CHEATING!!!!.This is not a calarie counting diet..okay...just Carb counting!   I had no more than 20 carbs a day.  Some days I had 15.  I did this for a month and lost 30 pounds.  Went from a size 12 to a size 7/8.   I believe you can do this.  The GREAT thing was I did not have to excercise at all...I did not excercise at all.   This is not easy, but it does work if you do it right.  The Atkins diet....look online at the site to find out more or buy the book.  Just go to yahoo and type in atkins diet.  Lets do this together...I am also trying to lose at least 80 pounds.

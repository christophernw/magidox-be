are you sure it's sprained and not strained? if it's sprained stay off it as much as possible, ice it for the first 48 hours after the injury then heat anytime after that and elevate it above your heart, lay on the floor and put your foot on the couch. Until swelling and bruising go down.. . If it's strained, then ice it and stay off of it the first day or so...go and get it xrayed

The answer to your question is a condition I term "logic dyslexia", liberals see the same thing we see but their minds turn it around and reverse what is obvious. Either I am right about this theory or they are just plain liars and so bend on their hatred of Bush for beating Gore and Kerry that no matter what truth they hear they deny or claim they disbelieve it. I am just glad I am not a twisted minded liberal who has to argue their unsupported point of view.. America isn't the enemy, beleive that, this country has given too much blood for freedom of millions in the past and those who will inherit freedom in the future, believe in America and be united for truth, democracy and personal rights and freedom, don't be a coward like the democrats.

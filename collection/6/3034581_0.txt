i had one from a cut i had in my mouth and i couldn't figure out why it wouldn't heal... turned out that it healed really quickly when i stopped eating and drinking acidic things (orange juice, tomato sauce, etc.) until it was completely gone.  so it might not be the medicine, it might just be eating habits.

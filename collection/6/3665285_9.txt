Immigration in general is necessary in order to have an influx/balance of money, labor, and skills into/out of a country.  (Isn't it good to allow people to move from one city to another, or one state to another? Those are also forms of immigration.)  These are normal push/pull factors.  If I find a better job in another city or state, I might move there.  If I lose my job or hate it so much that I quit, then I might move somewhere else to find something better.. Furthermore if neighboring countries are unstable politically/socially people will want to move out to a better place.  For example, a person might live in a very dangerous and ugly neighborhood, it makes sense that they might want to move and look for a better place.. Now, when illegal immigration occurs, that normally means that the need for money, labor, and/or skills is greater than what the country legally allows in.  It can also mean life is pretty bad in neighboring countries...

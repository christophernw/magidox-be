In 1962 a proposal at the United Nations meeting synagogue.    in Manila asked all people to take one day off.  Their point was.    that the production of labor itself was no longer on the earth,.    in the direction or under the plan.  They mentioned at noon.    time that the government had saved enough in one day to .    save the planet one last time, 40 billion dollars.  We often look.    at living like products and multiplication, adding and subtracting.    when GOD did ask us to do as HE taught us.  When people.    are doing what they are good at, wholesome farming and.    planning sports, fun, and the children's future, they will be safe..    Do not grow discouragement, the wrong flower for your own.    personal bouquet should be inner self.

Stop thinking its your inner dialog. It may not be so. Maybe its a happening like all the sounds that you hear outside. Try treating it like those sounds while you meditate. . . The trick is not to stop it but not get affected by it.. . If there is too much thought pay full attention to your chest area. You will find a lot of activity over there. The attention in this area itself reduces that activity and thought.

It depends on the jurisdiction (what laws are being applied), but where I'm at, the legal definition is given by Kansas Statutes Annotated (KSA) 21-3512. . (a) Prostitution is performing for hire, or offering or agreeing to perform for hire where there is an exchange of value, any of the following acts: (1) Sexual intercourse; (2) sodomy; or (3) manual or other bodily contact stimulation of the genitals of any person with the intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desires of the offender or another.. . So in Kansas, assuming that providing room and board would be considered "an exchange of value"; then yes, it could be prosecuted as prostitution. In this case, it would be a class B, non-person misdemeanor, so long as the people are both 16 years of age or older.

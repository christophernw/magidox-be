The type of Judaism that Jesus practiced was forever destroyed in 70 AD when the Temple in Israel was destroyed.  The Jewish people who continued the faith stopped the traditions that Jesus did <given by Moses and Aaron> like animal sacrifices on the alter.  Christians do not sacrifice animals because we believe that Jesus is the "Lamn Of God" and we experience the sacrifice through the Eucurist.  You can not find a Jewish temple that practices like Moses & Arron taught in today's society because of the temples destruction.. . Jesus bequeathed some of his powers to Peter and the other apostles before he ascended into heaven; forgiveness of sins, healing the sick, power to expel some demonâ€™s, and most importantly ... ability to lead the people and make/change laws.  Read "Acts" and you will see that Peter <Jesus gave Peter the keys to heaven> made necessary changes to unify the Church < IE allowing changes in the dietary restrictions, and circumcision restrictions>.  Further, when Peter was crucified, he passed the keys of heaven to the Pope ... this is why the Pope is a holy person ... he's got the keys to heaven with the ability to forgive sins <delegate who can forgive sins; priests>, expel some demons <delegate exorcisms>, and have infallible authority from the Pope seat.

Geothermal energy is a promising source of alternative energy that is being developed in some regions. There are varied methods being used to recover the heat from deep in the earth, but most work by drilling a well and sending water down the well where it is turned to steam and brought back up. The steam is converted to electricity using a turbine. . . Other applications are now being applied that will heat and cool a single house using a geothermal heat pump, that basically takes advantage of the fact that ground temperature is stable below a certain depth and can be used a heat sink or heat source as needed. These don't convert the heat to electricity, but use the heat directly. . . Few people realize that if not for the heat of the earth's interior we would have no oil and natural gas. The heat provided by the earth is essential for generating these compounds.

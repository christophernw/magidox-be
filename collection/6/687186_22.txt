Hangovers usually occur due to dehydration caused by the alcohol, so drinking plenty of water every time you wake up after a night of moderate to heavy drinking, will help. A little OJ--if your tummy can tolerate the acidity--in the water is good too, for the vitamin C. In fact, you should take Vit. C BEFORE drinking, and then B vitamins after--along with lots of water, of course.  You should wake up with NO HANGOVER by morning.

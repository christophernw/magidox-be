I could not agree more, Israel is becoming as terroristic as everyone else over there. they said they bombed in response to palestinians launching homemade small rockets into Israel, but I am not so sure anymore. I have been saying for a long time that. I am an american, of european descent, and I believe Israel to be as bad as the terrorists they are dealing with. . . On the other hand, even though Hamas was elected LEGALLY, they need to come INTO THE WORLD community with a different mindset. No one in the west wants to deal with people that blow people up. No one in the west will deal with a goverment that stands for terrorism, that includes Syria, and Iran!!!!! I believe that the Palestinians have a right to exist right along side the Israelis. That means RESPECTING each other, and co-existing together. after all.....all Israelis and all Palestinians bleed red blood. . . can ANYONE in the middle east put their religious and cultural differences aside and co-exist?? We do it every day in the US.. . Everyone is mad over the territory the Israelis have (from the 6 day war), but they were attacked remember? and keeping booty is a custom of war, even in the middle east. They have given part of the land back, Palestine has had elections.....now find a way for Hamas to come into the world, not viewed as a terroristic goverment....and deal with Israel and the world. . . remember....violence only begets violence, and BOTH Israel and Palestine are guilty. The US and the world does not like what is going on over there......but we do support Israels right to exist....it is part of OUR religion. We respect your religion, please respect ours. ps please email me @dfwcher@yahoo.com

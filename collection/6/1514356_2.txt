How much sleep do you actually get? Do you sleep throughout the entire night or do you wake up quite a bit? Maybe you don't actually need as much sleep as you are getting, because you might be oversleeping. Maybe you should try going to your GP and getting some tests done to see if your tiredness isn't because of a medical reason. Hope this helps =)

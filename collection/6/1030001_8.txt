Because religion has always been of satan and divides.  Faith in Christ Jesus, the only begotten son of God, who died for our sins, rose again, ascended into heaven to be at the Father's right hand, and when we accept him and him alone as our Savior, sends the Holy Spirit to indwell within us. The Gospel of John says He was the Word made flesh and it's that Word, the Bible, and the Bible alone that Jesus Christ gave us to live under.  If people hate you because of your religion, then they only have a religion too.  Because as a Christian, not a religious person calling myself a Christian, I don't hate you, I don't hate anyone as far as that goes, but I do hate(disfavor strongly by definition) religions that lead people away from Jesus Christ, because what I see are souls that are misled and headed to hell and it breaks my heart with sorrow that Christ who came in Truth was and is rejected by so many.

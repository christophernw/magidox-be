People normally measure that against their own intelligence and personality, and preference.  If you meet someone who knows things you don't know, you find that person intelligent.  If the person seem to have things in common as you, and you like and agree with the way how he/she behaves, then you would think that the person is nice.  That's how it's measured most of the time. Also, if there is someone who is said to be nice and intelligent by someone has power or fame, then many people tend to agree with it.  In this case, it is measured against intelligence, personality and preference of someone who you like.

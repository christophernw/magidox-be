You have answered your own question but you seem not to have any idea what gender means.  Male and female is two genders.  Nature makes many living things two sexes as a method of evolution.  One gender that can reproduce its self is no more than a clone and therefore would be nearly identical for a long period of time.  By having two genders the male and female there is a mix of two slightly different members of the same group.  This allows for much faster evolution and progress in development to cope with changing conditions of life.  It strengthens the species along the way.  Gender is male and female.

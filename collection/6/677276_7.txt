Politely ignore him/her.. . Talk to them ONLY when necessary and be courteous.. . You have better things to deal with than with somebody that hasn't grow up yet.. . If you get angry with this kind of people, they only will make it worse, and enjoy it.. At the beginning of the process of ignoring them, they will come back more to you, but then they will realize they are waisting their time and will start picking on someone else.

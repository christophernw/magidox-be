Selfishness! It's only easy if that is what you are. Get outside yourself and see how everything you do affects another persons existance on this planet. If you cannot do that, I pitty you and every person you ever come in contact with. Maybe you should turn yourself in for lifetime incarceration if you do not turn yourself around.. Do good! Feel good! and good will come to you!

The belief in a "hell", other than that which we live in every day here on Earth, was a man-made creation...along with it's diety, Satan...to promote fear in the general masses by the dogma of the time.  Fear being the easiest & quickest way to establish control of the human factor...still reigns heartily today.. To beleive in such, however, also means believing in an imperfect, unloving, favorite-playing God, which, course is not truth. Nice to see someone doing a little homework!

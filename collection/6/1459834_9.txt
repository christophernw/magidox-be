Because it is a statue.....it's cast in copper.  You don't paint statues.. . In the early '80s it was renovated.  There was a huge advertising campaign for it, and every American citizen was invited to send in $1 to help pay for the cleaning and restoration.  I sent in my dollar.. . They'll do it again someday.

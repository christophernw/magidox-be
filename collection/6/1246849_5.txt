i would take the Daily Show over FOX ( Fairly unBalanced  ) any time - but not having cable, and having no disire to watch television, most of my news comes from sources like the BBC, or CNN World News web site, or the Christian Science Moniter - or some of the more creditable on line news sources.  I won't watch TV for " entertainment" - its an insult to one's intelligence.  That said, the Daily Show is satire.. there is more truth there than most on-air TV news venues.

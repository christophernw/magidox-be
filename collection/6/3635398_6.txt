Dimension is the property by which we describe a particular fact.Such as a space can be depicted by 3 dimensions of length..  Such as P=nRT/V (for P=pressure,V=Volume,T=Temperature) So pressure can be be depicted by 2 dimension temperature,Volume.. So unless and until u describe of what fact u need to know the fourth dimension ur question has no answer..  However generally we understand dimension as dimension of universe.. From that point of view the fourth dimension of universe is time as from the space-time structure of universe.

A simple way to define this phenomenon is by using the Le Chatelier's Principle, it stats that if a stress is placend upon a system in equilibrium, the equilibrium is displaced in the direction that counteratcs the effect of the stress. This principle can be applied to any chemical reaction that reacts to form an equilibrium at the end.

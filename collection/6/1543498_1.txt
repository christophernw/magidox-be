the colors, the fabrics, the shapes, they all set the mood. for instance you wouldn't want a homeless woman in a slinky black Armani dress...unless it was tattered and she had a riches-to-rags story. costuming is a big part of mood in theatre. music, sets, and obviously the actors help. hope this helped! good luck!

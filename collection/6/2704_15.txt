They are all self centered and just crazy & immature these days. It would be nice if we could go back in time like some of those old movies and all of them were gentlemen and full of chivalry and prided themselves on good morals. I'm affraid that will never be again. But do not give up!!! There are a few, you just have to know where to look and which ones to avoid. Guys stick labels on girls fat, skinney, not popular, easy, etc. so us girls can have labels for them too. Jerk, man whore, meyth head,   wild,  etc. we have to start sterotyping them if we don't want to get hurt. It's usually the one you don't notice, the one in the not so popular crowd, maybe just plain. They might be the one that will be very kind and cherish you & and make you happy. Don't go for the ones everybody else if after, you will be in constant doubt and looking over your shoulder to see if someone is checking your man out. I think security and being treated like a real person would be the ultimate happiness..Protect your heart just watch how many girls those popular guys go through. Don't be another notch in his belt.

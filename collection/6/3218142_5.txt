Very subjective question, to you the Americans, it is probably either Gettysburg or Pearl Harbour. To me, a European, it is probably the Siege of Vienna in 1683, it was the start of the eventual downfall of the Ottoman Empire. From that point on the Russian Empire started its long rise, The Holy Roman Empire fell into terminal decline, France started to dominate Europe, and the Hapsburgs started their rise. The seeds of the First World War were sown.

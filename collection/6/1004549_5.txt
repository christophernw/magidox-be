My friend used to work for CDF.  She said the training was brutal.  Going up and down mountains with 70 pound back-packs on in over 100 degree heat.  If you are physically fit and are not afraid of hard work, this job might be for you.  Go to your local CDF or fire house.  I'm  Sorry CDF is the California Dept. of Forestry.  Good luck.

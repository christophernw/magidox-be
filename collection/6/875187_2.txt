Frankie go get a life it wasn't even helping.... . Hmm... one possible way is to break his neck so that he could get excuse from work :D... but thats the most last thing you would do ><.. . You should firstly try to occupy your free time with something else so that you could try to keep your mind off him. Maybe listening to music you like or reading. Whenever he's home try to explain it to him... no matter what.. . Do not blame yourself for this!! This is happening cause of a job... don't ask him to quit his job it'll most likely affect the relationship. . . I hope this helps but I seriously didn't have a personal experience off this... hope everything works out for you :&#92; stay strong!!

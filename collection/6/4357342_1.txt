Don't forget to change/clean the air filter, and if it has one, change the fuel filter.  If it doesn't have one, buy a plastic inline one at the local parts store... old gas tanks corrode on the inside and the rust will foul up the carb.. Check the front fork seals make sure they're not leaking (look over the whole bike for leaking oil for that matter). And check / change the brake pads so you wont find out the hard way it doesn't stop.  Lube the throttle cable (tool available at motorcycle parts stores) and same with brake cable.  You'll be good for a couple years if you keep it maintained and outta the weather when parked.

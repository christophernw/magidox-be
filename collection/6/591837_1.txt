Because Mercury is so close to the sun, it has virtually no atmosphere to trap the heat. Its atmosphere was basically "burned off.". . However, Venus has an extensive atmosphere, mostly composed of carbon dioxide which allows heat to be trapped but not emitted. Because of this, Venus is kind of like an oven. The temperature can reach up to 900 degrees (F).

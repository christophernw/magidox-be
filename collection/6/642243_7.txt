the only way to get HONEST official is for the community to choose the best one to lead.  Every nation / society is broken down to the smallest unit ie, the village or small town.   It is incumbent upon the people of that community to choose the best person who could lead the community.  It is not easy.  You have to choose someone who is selfless, would work for the community not for glory or money but for the common good.  I am sure, you will find such people in any community.  It is just that perhaps they dont like to join politics as they dont have an ulterior motive.  As you can see today in nearly all society, thsoe who join politics have their private interest first then the interest of the others second - hence they may not in certain circumstances not able to act objectively.   Again, politics is power and $$$.   . . Therefore if you can find a group of people who can lead the community selflessly and without an agenda, you have honesty.  This instant from the small village can extrapolate into a cluster of more villages, towns and so forth till it reaches the national level.  And consequently the international level as humanity is truly one despite the differences in color and religions.. . It is best that a council be chosen to lead the community rather than individuals as governance is not an easy task.  Maybe a council of 7 or 9.  Its sufficient to have diversity and to cater for different approaches to various issues that faces the community.. . You notice that with this system of choosing the best and reliable person to lead the community, we can do away with political parties.   This is at this juncture in human history, ideal and utopian but if we work towards it, its achievable.

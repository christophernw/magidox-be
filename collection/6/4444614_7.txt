Carbohydrates are energy. Thing is, it's okay to have carbs if you're going to burn it off. You run out of energy if you don't have carbs. Soup to nuts, it's unhealthy and you run out of energy. Don't do it. Instead, just eat a balanced diet based on the *new* food pyramid and do plenty of exercise. It's much better.

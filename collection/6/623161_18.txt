We don't think we're the only ones getting into heaven. Any one who is loving, kind, etc. can get into heaven. Anyone who doesn't question someone else's faith. If you show love for another person you can get into heaven. To me it isn't the Christians who think they're the only one's getting into heaven, it's the other religions who believe there is only heaven and no hell. The ones who worship devils. And the ignorant ones who really teach their followers they're the only one's getting into heaven.

Study for and get a GED first. Take a couple of classes at your local community college for a couple of semesters to get a feel of what college is like. From what I heard, the level of difficulty between community college classes and regular colleges/universities are pretty much the same even though community colleges often get stereotyped as being "easy".Try to find a community college with classes related to computer science to build up your skills.Take math classes too of course. Do very well and try to transfer to a college or university. Colleges and universities like to see an applicant that sincerely wants to get the most out of their education and can prove it by their transcripts. . . P.S. If you're trying for a 4 year-degree at a university/college, make sure the classes you take over at the community college can transfer over there as it saves a lot of time, money and headaches -especially General Education Classes. Tuition at community colleges is a lot cheaper so it's better to spend money on those classes there than at the university. Anyways, wish you luck!

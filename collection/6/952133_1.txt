Genetic engineering is the manipulation of the DNA of one organism by the introduction of a gene from another organism. After adding the gene, the gene starts functioning normally and we get the desired characteristics we want in that organism.. The gene can be introduced by 'carriers' or vectors- like viruses, bacteria or a spray of liposomes.

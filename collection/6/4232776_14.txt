there is archeological find proving that israel did live there. google ooops yahoo for it. there is archeological proof in other countries as well that israel existed. so even if the bible didnt mention it you could still base it on other 'written'  evidence. regarding the zionist that forced the british out. well i cant see the british giving up a piece of land to terrorists. im NOT sayin that the zioninst were tea and crumpet serving to the british. and saying that britain and the un including russia and the us were agreeable to the renewal of a jewish state. mostly to solve the jewish question. so in reality it wasnt begin, wietzmann or bengurion who got the land it was hitler. weird huh?

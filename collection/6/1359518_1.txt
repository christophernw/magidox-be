When you first start up the engine, the (ABS) anti lock brake system light will appear, that means that it is testing, to make sure that they are working properly. The light should stay on for 1-2 seconds, and then turn off. If it stays on, you should have it checked out.You will see many lights coming on, when you first start up. These indicate, they are going through a normal cycle, self testing. If any of the dash board lights stay on, it means there could be trouble, with that system.

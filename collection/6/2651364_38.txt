Well, even tho' I do it (often), I think it is always "rude" to tell someone to f-off.  But I think it is equally rude to walk up to someone and start questioning him/her about their religious beliefs or lack of them.  My favorite answer to one of these morons who can't live and let live is, "Whatever in the world would make you ask a question like that?"  (Of course, a person who was rude enough to approach you like that in the first place probably wouldn't get the sarcasm of the answer, and would probably launch into a long-winded explanation of why they just had to ask--at which point you would probably be justified with the f-off.)

the key thing is to be familiar with your speech/presentation. and have some notes on q-cards. if you mess up or forget a word shut up, and take a poss, glance at your q-cards. stand up straight and relax. mve yur hands, move around on stage, control the audince, when you have control, u poss real eaisly and they would wait in suspence. and if no one is recording you or/and taping you don't worry, the people would look at you and clap no matter what you do. belive me i have tried it, i was presenting a speech in front of the school about the relationship of america in the past and in present time. i had a paragraph about gun control. i got mixed up and forgot where i was on paper. i possed and then said "and thepresedent of the National Rife Association said 'from my cold dead hands.'" it wasn't suppose to be there, but it came to mind. my teacher started to clap. he himself liked that part.

God didn't take your friend, heroin did.  God doesn't take children to make examples.  Your friend died because it was her time.  You lost someone you love, I lost my best friend in a school riot in 72, my faith was hit hard too.  I prayed all night please lord don't take him.  But he did.  It took me years to realize that it was his time.  I believe to this day my friend is with the lord and I will never doubt it.  I'm so sorry for your loss and I know it will be along time before you get over it.  But ask yourself what would she want you to do.

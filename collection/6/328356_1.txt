I agree with the other answers: we're a very big country where almost everyone speaks english, so we don't feel we need to learn another language. I do admire Europeans who speak 5-6 languages, seemingly without effort. I think we should be more multi-lingual, but you have to remember in Europe for example, France, Spain, Germany, and England are like 4 seperate states here.

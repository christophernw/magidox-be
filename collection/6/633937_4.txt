Even if you knew what you were talking about, why do you even care what other people think? Athiests don't care what you think, so keep it to yourself and we'll all get along nicely. It's the fanatics like you who thin you need to shove your beliefs down other people's throats. More wars have been fought by religious zealots than for any other reason. You people need to chill. YOu may be happy with your beliefs but leave the others to believe what they will and the world would be a more peaceful place to live.

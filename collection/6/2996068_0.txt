Proof is all around you... just keep your eyes open and be willing to see it. . I know because I have a personal relationship with Him (that might sound weird if you havent experienced it) plus the evidence. . Ex: if you look at all the beauty, especially in nature you can see that it couldnt have come from nothing. Ex: the Bible was written by 100's of different people, from all nations a languages, from different eras...yet is perfect and matches up, also prophesies have been and are being fullfilled which proves that it is God-breathed. ....believe me there are ALOT more...

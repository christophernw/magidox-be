Go buy a Haynes manual about your particular model of car.  They are about $12-$15 and available at most auto parts stores. At the beginning of the book you can choose the problem you car is having, and then you are referred to what the possible problems are and how to fix it. Pick up a few terms out of this book and a few options of what your problems are or might be. Pointing out a particular part (the manuals have pictures) to the mechanic will also show that you have a pretty good idea of what you're talking about.  You might even discover it's something minor that you can even fix.  If nothing else, the mechanic will know that you have a few ideas of what the problem is and will have to think twice about taking advantage of you.  F.Y.I. mechanics take advantage of men from time to time too.

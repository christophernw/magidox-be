Hydrogen is not used in aircrafts. It is prefered in spacecrafts.. 1. It has high efficiency.. 2. Its waste products are not toxic, but water..      Even eco-friendly car (Toyota) uses the same fuel. They are planning to produce cars also based on this technology..      But cars are to be handled carefully as a small ignition problem can create an explosion.

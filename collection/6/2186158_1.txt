Maybe you can try thinking like a kid, recalling what children stories appealed to you when you were younger.. Or observe your little siblings, cousins and see what books they like.. . And when you've got your story.. (Btw, I think a simple story would be enough for young children. I don't think they can keep their attention there for too long). . You can start making the book, maybe you could think of a nice font to use, something cute and big so it will be nice to look at.. . Oh! And include lots of colours, children are very sensitive to that. Hmm, when i was a child, I loved books which had pop-ups, or even books which included pictures which had different textures (E.g a shirt that has the texture of cloth).. . That'd make the book really engaging for the child! With the different senses stimulated !. . Good luck with your book! (:

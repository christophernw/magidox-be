The best way would be to take your pet to a vet to treat the itching with antihistamines and then any infection from the scratching with antibiotics. You will then need to keep the pet on some kind of flea control product like andvantage or frontline year round so the pet will never be bit by a flea again. For a pet with a flea allergy, just one bite from a flea can set off a whole cycle of pain and discomfort for the pet that can only be resolved by another visit to the vet

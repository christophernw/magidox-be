Cats are majestic hunters who can never be fully domesticated. I think people like you don't like cats coz they are smart and independent. You probably want a pet that will follow you around all day and do everything you teach it to do. I like dogs and I think they can be very useful buts cats are different. They have a mind of their own. Cats are a lot more selective in who they like or choose to be affectionate towards. You probably met a cat who didn't like you and just couldn't stand it, right?

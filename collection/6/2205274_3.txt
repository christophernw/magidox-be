Essentially only 10% of the mass of the star is in core.  This does not apply to all stars: low mass solar metallicity stars are fully convective...all the way down to their cores! The entire star is involved in fusion over time as gas from the envelope of the star gets carried down into the core. (I once estimated the main sequence lifetime of an M star to be something like 100 billion years! I don't remember exactly, except that is was MUCH longer than the estimated age of the universe.). . Also, some more massive more evolved stars experience  periods of "dredging" where helium and carbon rich gas from core or maybe shells around the core make it to the surface.  So called "carbon stars" have their high carbon content from this phenomenon. Presumably this means some hydrogen and helium from the envelope gets mixed into the area where fusion is sustained.  This happens after the star leave the main sequence, however, so may not have a significant impact on life extension.

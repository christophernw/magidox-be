A 2 month -old puppy doesn't have enough neurological maturity for any success at potty training.  Neurological control of bladder and bowel functions naturally will occur around the age of 3-4 months.  That's when you will notice that the puppy's room is clean and dry for awhile.  (The same for small children--a dry diaper for a nap, for instance). . So then you use the "crate method"  Buy a book that descirbes this.  Some would say that a crate is inhumane.  But really, how many accidents in the house do you really want to clean up?  It is also a learning experience for the puppy. It does not want a messy room either, so having to have it's own urine and stool around provides a learning experience.  For example, you will notice a dog will go far away from it's own area to relieve itself.

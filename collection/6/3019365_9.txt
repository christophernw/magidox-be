Cats are adorable but independent creatures.  You can't stop their wanting to run outside.  You just have to close that door quickly when you go in & out.  You could try putting kitty in another room with door closed when you need to leave front door open for an extended amount of time.  Then let kitty roam around the house again when the door is closed.

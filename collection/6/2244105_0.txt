I don't think it is entirely should - it's also party that we are just nicer often.  We are sending out christmas cards and we include that friend we haven't spoken to in a couple years for a change and that's the spark that reignites the relationship, now that by gones are forgotten - you know what I mean.  We often are just of good spirits and things that would have upset us kind of don't as much.  . . Of course, there are lots of folks who trudge through the holidays and grumble about the crowds and commercialization, etc.  They are our modern day Scrouges - the folks who can't appreciate 1 month out of the year when people are genuinely thinking of one another and trying to do nice things.. . Peace!

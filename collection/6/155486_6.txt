No such thing. Every particle in the universe pulls on all others with a force called gravity. This force is proportional to the square of the distance. However, it exists always, however infintesimal. So zero gravity is a paradox. It will never exist. The center of the Earth has gravity. It is so small, however, that our instruments would never be able to detect it.

It's a really great musical on Broadway right now made from the songs of ABBA.  I would highly recommend it. It is about a girl named Sophie who is trying to figure out who her real Father is.  The songs are amazing.  The plot is interesting and the dancing is amazing.  The special affects are pretty sweet also.  I hope this helps.  It is also the name of a song in the musical!! watch this Fucking great musical!

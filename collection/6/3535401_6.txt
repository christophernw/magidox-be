There is no  evolution  and there has never been any evolution. If there were evidence would be widespread and readily available. to folks that actually believe that twisted theory of evolution------why has there never been found one single shred of evidence? there have been so-called 'findings' that were later proven to be hoaxes. you can't tell me that in all of all the millions of fossilized remains that have been discovered not a single one has shown genuine evidence of evolution------where is the fossilized evidence? the answer is easy you can't find any evidence since the myth of evolution is just that-----a myth and pure bunk Darwin was a loser.if there really was evolution evidence would be quite abundant.

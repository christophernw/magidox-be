I believe that you should go to the foot doctor and let him know what happened to your toe nail because if it is black like that it could be fungus. It can be worse it you take care of it now before the summer time. That is when everybody shows off there toes and go to the beach, when it comes to the body you have to be very careful. If it is fungus it can spread to the other toe nails and effect them. Please go to the foot doctor, he will then give you what ever medicine that you need.

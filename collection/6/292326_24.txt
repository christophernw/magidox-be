Unfortunately, since this is America, even white supremacists have the right to their opinion. That is one of the heritages I have that I am ashamed of (I'm part German)..  I also find it odd that white supremacists could pledge allegiance to the flag, but worship Hitler. But unfortunately, they have this right, after all this is America.

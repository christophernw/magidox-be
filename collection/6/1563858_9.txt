Actually, (yes, I know this is creepy) I have walked through a graveyard in the middle of the night. To make it even more frightening, it was a graveyard that was pretty far away from the main city, nestled under a lone church on a mountain in Greece. My rational side was not at all unsettled...it was beautiful with the huge, ornate tombs that are characteristic of that part of Greece, and there was a full moon, so you could see everything. My more gothic side was just the tad bit disturbed though...

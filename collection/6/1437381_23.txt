Add liquid or solid flavoring before freezing. Crushed Life Savers, for instance. Instant coffee, iced tea. Use yr imagination. Or "paint," dribble, drop, etc., a liquid flavor on top after freezing and freeze again.. . (Of course, always isolate the ice tray in an airtight bag or container, unless you want the cubes to be pea-flavored ;)

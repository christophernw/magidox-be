Well, you really do have to buckle down. You HAVE to do your work. But of course, that's for anything. But school is more important. But you know, high school isn't as bad as entertainment makes it. Like when I was in middle school and I would watch movies about high school or people in high school or something. They kind of exaggerate high school. It's fun sometimes. It also depends on where you go. By the way, freshman do get it bad at times. But last semester I was a freshman, and I was pretty much accepted. Hopefully you won't have it hard with that.

in the past, people had slaves to help them with domestic work and other matters.. . Obvisouly over time, people that work for us are no longer callled slaves....they are now called staff.  . these can include in-house staff (for those really posh and rich people who have domestic staff) or the worksmen that come to fix your utilities (the gas man, water authority, electricty and so on)

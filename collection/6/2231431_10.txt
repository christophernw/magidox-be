A minor sex offense (no pun intended) to those of you who can't imagine such a thing, might be and adult who had sex with a 17 year old girl who turns 18 the next month and lied about her age.. . Or making a lewd remark or proposition to a minor when an adult is drunk and having a bad day.. . Or, viewing a few images of child pornography on the Internet out of curiosity, where there is no real physical victim.. . As far as sex offenders being demonized, I couldn't agree more. It reminds me exactly of the Salem witch hunts back in the day. I guess they will start burning them at the stake next.

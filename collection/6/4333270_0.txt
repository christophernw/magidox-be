The daughter of two hippies who sold out once told me that "if teh hippies taught us anything it is that to make the world better we first have to make ourselves better". I think that's a pretty good think to learn. I also have to say that at least when the Vietnam war was going on they had a movement against it. Canada was also then a safehaven for draftdodgers (unlike today). They problem is that most people who were experimenting with hallucinogenic drugs at the time thought that was a spiritual quick fix kind of thing. Many of them stopped their spiritual paths after a while and sold out. Others experiemented with hard drugs. Thus, at the end of the '70's there is this huge cultural burnout where two decades of intoxication just caught up with society. That's why welost so much of what the hippies did for us. . This generation needs to stand up and take over. Its a bunch of stauncy old folks causing all the problems and they don't care because they'll dead in twenty years. Its really screwed up that you have to be over fifty to president of the US. Bring in some young blood...

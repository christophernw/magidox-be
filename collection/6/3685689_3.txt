Assuming it's your standard 4-cylinder Accord, the towing capacity should be about 1000 lbs with a 100 lb towing hitch.  If you are going to tow anything with this vehicle, I would recommend having a transmission fluid cooler installed.  A cooler will help minimize the extra wear on your transmission, and should cost anywhere from $50-$250 depending on whether you can install it yourself.

You may have a back problem, go to a doctor. Till then, lie flat on your back while sleeping, avoid a pillow.. Sit in kneel down position, also known as Vajrasana, for atleast 20 minutes a day while watching TV etc.. This should help.. But please go to a doctor, and if pain killers is all he recommends, get a second opinion.

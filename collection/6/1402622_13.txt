YAY!!  I'm glad someone else out there thinks like I do!  I don't care who anyone worships or if they worship at all. Worship hotdogs for all I care. Just live your life in a decent manner, and don't force your beliefs on me.  I happen to have a very excellent relationship with MY God.  And it's really none of my business who YOUR God is - or if you have one....just live, and let live.

You may wish to check www.autozone.com which has repair info on-line.  It gives the location of the fuel filter, what type of connections you may encounter.  Normally, I crimp the fuel line directly in front of the filter and behind the filter with locking jaw pliers to stem the flow of gas before removing the filter.  But use only enough pressure to stop the flow and be careful not to damage the line.

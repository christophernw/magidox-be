Give the raw chicken a light coating of butter before it goes into the oven.. Cover the baking tray with tin foil for the first half of cooking, then take it off in time to let the chicken brown.. You also have to baste it regularly.. (Pour the juice that come out into the roasting tray back on top of the chicken). . . Voil√† - Juicy chicken shall be yours.

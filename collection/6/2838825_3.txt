i would like to hear more about these supposed contradictions, as many of them can be dissected and resolved with proper hermeneutics and exegesis.. . as far as the clergy of Rome theory - this is a common misconception that many people believe (especially after the release of Dan Brown's literary work), but upon the proper study of history, it can also be disproved.. . For instance, the Bible was circulating in the early second century (100-105) and accepted as Scripture, as attested to by the Early church fathers.  The big theory is that in the second century, Constantine declared Christianity to be the religion of Rome, and then the Church leaders of that day conspired with him in writing the Bible.. . Unfortunately, there are way too many inconsistencies in that thought process.  Constantine's Edict of Tolerance was not announced until the early fourth century, and the Council of Nicea did not convene until the mid fourth century.. . Also - the council vote on which books were cannonical was about 300 to 2.  ouch.... . i hope that helps some - i encourage you to do some objective research into this.. . EDIT: I forgot about the ten commandments part! sorry!. . The ten commandments are not the specific commandments by which we live today...for instance, i have not coveted my neighbor's donkey or maidservant in a long time (though sometimes i may struggle...it's a very nice donkey!). . Jesus gave us new commands that further reveal the ten commandments: love God with everything you are, love others like you love yourself.  . . Now on to homosexuality.  It is condemned as a sin in other parts of Scripture, so it would fall under obeying God - a demonstration of one's love.

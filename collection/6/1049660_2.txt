next time that happens push him off of you & tell him... no !. when he says "what?!"  tell him that you don't feel comfortable huging & that your just friends.  He needs the message loud & clear to avoid a "maybe i can win her over phase" (if he does like you, like you ).. . if he is a real friend he would apolgize, probably feel alittle stupid & still be your friend with out any further occurance.. . if not he probably was not as good as a friend as you thought. . hope this helps,. . ss

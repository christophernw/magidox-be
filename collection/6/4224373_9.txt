Just do it... and without pretentions.  If you like a girl very much and want her to like you back, then you have to let her know who you really are.  It would really be difficult later on if you make her like someone you're only pretending to be. Just imagine, it's either you have to be who you're not for the rest of your life, or you'll give her a really bad surprise when she gets to know the other you.

Some "companies" claim you can make hundreds of thousands by sitting at your desk while taking care of your children, but I believe the safest, and easiest way is www.ebay.com ,  www.amazon.com or other websites in the same category. You can sell your unwanted things, and make money off of them! it's something I'd invest in.

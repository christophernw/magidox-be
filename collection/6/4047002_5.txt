Liberal values stem around the idea that individual liberty is the primary political value. Essentually, each and every person has the same rights and liberties, and can live their life however they feal fit, including religion, sexuality, political association, as long as their actions do not infringe on the rights of others.. Because of the basic Liberal ideology that individuals can have free expression, values becomes a missnomer. For instance, conservitives consider family values to mean that families that consist of a mother, father, and children are correct, while other forms of family are some short or broken form of that valuable family. Liberals however consider family values to mean, any intimate relationship that values respect, love, honesty and providership.. A good liberal family could be a single mother, her best friend, and her 2 children, as long as the mother and friend love and respect the children, work to provide for eachother, and are honest and open.. Conservitives on the other hand would consider this family very broken, and dissfunctional.

Generally lightning will pass through the metal frame of the airplane doing little damage. It essentially acts as a Faraday cage (q.v.) Severe damage to parts of planes made of non-conductive (i.e. composite materials, including fiberglass) has occurred. As far as the plane being electrically grounded; that big ol' spark just jumped 3 miles or more of atmosphere to GROUND. DO YOU THINK IT REALLY MATTERS IF THE PLANE IS GROUNDED. Same analysis applies to that few inches of ground clearance for an automobile only more so.

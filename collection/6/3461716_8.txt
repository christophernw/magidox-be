Are you giving your bunny treats like lettuce? (never feed rabbits lettuce)Anything other than their pellets should be fed in very small amounts and only as a treat. Diarrhea can be fatal! If it's only a little, you might try giving your rabbit a few blackberry leaves (works). Otherwise, get her to the vet a.s.a.p.

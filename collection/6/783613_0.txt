Here's how I see it:  Being righteous means being sinless and of good moral character.  Christians strive to become righteous, just as Jesus is.  We can become righteous with the grace of God.  Self-righteousness, in my opinion, is a state of righteousness that is self-appointed, not God-appointed.  Someone who is self-righteous believes they're right according to their own rules and standards, not God's standards.  A lot of self-righteous people tend to be  pompous - they're arrogant, boastful, egotistical and conceited.  They're usually very showy in their words and actions -- much like the Pharisees in biblical times.. . Most self-righteous people are pompous, but not all pompous people are self-righteous.  Clear as mud, right?  :o)

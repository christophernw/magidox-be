people like that do not trust the universe to be at least neutral in regard to them.  I mean by this that they think that there is some power in creation that is always against them.  Most religions teach that the power behind the universe, sometimes called God, has positive intentions toward all people.  The people you are talking about believe the opposite --- that the power in the universe influences all people to have negative intentions toward them.  This is probably due to some loss or lack of care in the person's childhood.

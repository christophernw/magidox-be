Its the same as most Americans don't give a damn about how the rest of the world lives. Did you care about people in Africa? Do you care about people dying all over the world? Do you care about the horrible conditions that 80% of the people on the planet live in? I didn't think so! Most people don't give a damn about anyone else. They only care about it when something actually happens to them, and then they wonder why no-one cares.

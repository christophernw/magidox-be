I've been both. A Graphic Artist is someone who works for a retail company, usually. They get pulled to do print art, brochures, business cards, logos, images in books, T-shirts, etc.. . A Graphic Designer is usually associated with technology, the web, and/or software. So a Graphic Designer would be designing an interface. That's like the buttons and layout of a web page or an application. . . It's a slightly different skill set. Graphic Artists try to make things look as good as possible. Graphic Designers try to make things as easy to use as possible. Then they try to make things look good after they are easy to use. As the name suggests, the Graphic Designer actually designs the UI (User Interface).. . That said, a title is a title. People call positions whatever they want. There will be constant exceptions on both sides.. . Here is a website I did: www.mission-world.com

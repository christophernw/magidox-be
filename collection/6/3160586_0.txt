I installed Microsoft Money which showed me where all our money was going.  Then I made changes like cutting out expenses we could do without, cancelled our home phone to switch to cheaper voice over internet phone, changed to lower cost cable TV, stopped eating out so much, etc.  Then I was able to start paying off higher interest credit cards.  Once all the credit cards were paid off, I started putting money into an emergency fund and stopped using credit cards all together.

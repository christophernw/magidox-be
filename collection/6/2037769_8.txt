Religious people believe that all life is sacred, and that only God should decide matters concerning the endings of lives.  . . The idea that certain lives are not worth living is very subjective, and once we allow one person (or group) to decide which people deserve to go on living and which do not, we allow the deciders' flawed judgment to rule over life and death.. . Stephen Hawking, for example is in a miserable physical state.  His mind, however, is one of the greatest of our generation, and his contributions to physics has been unmeasurable.  Should someone have decided to Euthanize him, we would have lost a precious gift.. . Also, once you start deciding life and death for others, you are tempted to "move the bar" and take out people who may just be old or depressed or people who's illnesses simply cost their families too much money.  I'd hate to think my Grandmother's life wasn't worth her medical bills.. . Finally, if you take the responsibility for deciding life and death, you can eventually arrive at horrible conclusions, like the Nazis deciding that millions of Jewish people ought to be put down for the "betterment" of the Nazi interests.

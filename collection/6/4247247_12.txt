Sin is always sin. Time period does not matter. However some will be held to different standards. Teachers will be dealt with in a stricter fashion. People who never heard of Jesus will be judged by what they did with the revelation they had (Rom. 1). Christians will be punished differently from lost persons. The thing to remember is that all will be judged. There will be two groups- lost and saved. you want to make sure you are in the saved group.

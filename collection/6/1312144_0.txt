The pain of the loss allows emotion to pivot like a balancing, we remember the departed for the good times shared and in this remembrance the joy of those moments are brought out. The lost for some however can be so overwhelming that they can't stop mourning at this point in their grief, which is quite understandable if you've ever experienced the loss of one held so dear. The fun in funeral is a coincidence(although in my culture they have what is called a wake where little sandwiches are served with tasty beverages), and mourning has nothing to do with morning; but the coincidence allows for the thought that for the bereaved a new day will come, with the dawn bringing light back into the darkness that fills their hearts, or at least that is my hope. Great question, thank you for asking it.

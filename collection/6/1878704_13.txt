It is a conspiracy theory which speculates that Jesus and Mary Magdalene had children and that their bloodline survives to this day. Dan Brown writes about this in his book. The novel focuses on a woman whose father was murdered but was the last person alive who knew the truth. He is forced to leave clues to inform his daughter, who with the help of Robert Langdon (a symbologist) discovers the truth.. . It has been adapted into a movie directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks.. . Also, it is a conspiracy theory. It contains many flaws and is fiction. Some believe it is true, and that is fine. Personally, it had no bearing on my Christian beliefs. It doesn't matter to me one lick whether Jesus has great-great-great-great-etc. grandchildren alive today or not.. . Hope that helps!

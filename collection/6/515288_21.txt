Really its more about the person, I personally don't get defensive i love to be challenged. but, of course i have a personal relationship with God i wouldn't call Christianity a Religion. I guess you could get frustrated, its really hard to try to prove your point w/ a person that is spiritually dead. before you give your life to the Lord and accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior the Spirit inside you is dead. the Spirit is what Judges the word of God to be true. Try Salvation for your self it really is cool! and things will start happening for you. Its like this, the devil puts a blind fold over your eyes and when you give your life to the Lord, God will start taking it of little by little, till you could see things for what they really are. and the best thing about it is that your name will be writtin in the book of life, wish means your garantied a room in heaven. and I know this is true because I speak to the Lord and he speaks to me and thats how i have a personal relationship with him, and i also know that i will get anything i ask for in prayer because he loves to give to his children! and what the devil does when he puts the blind fold on us is, try to rob us of what the Lord our God has for us. and also once we are his children we have an inheritence that he leaves us here, so we have authority over many things. and whats better than to know that you have the greatest power to back you up! the devil doesnt want us to know that, he doesnt want us to know that we actually have the power and the authority that are father gave us to bind him and send him back to the hole he came from. sorry, i went a little off the subject. but i hope this answers your question a little!. .

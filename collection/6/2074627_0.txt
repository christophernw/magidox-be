I think that our behaviors change as a way to adapt and to survive/ integrate into that particular environment.  For example, I may wear shorts and a T-shirt when I go to someplace casual, but I wear business-attire when I go to work.  I wouldn't necessarily wear shorts to work or a business suit to the supermarket.  The particular environment that I am entering may call for me to do things a certain way in order to be accepted into that environment.

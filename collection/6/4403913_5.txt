It's a useful approximation for the constant we call pi, which is an irrational number equal to, approximately, 3.14159265359.. . Of course, it's not possible numerically to multiply something by an exact value for pi, because like all irrational numbers pi has an infinite, non-repeating decimal expansion.  As a result, people use approximations, the most common being:. . 22/7 = 3.142857142857.... (accurate to 3 significant figures). 3.14 (accurate to 3 significant figures, but beyond that *slightly* less accurate than 22/7). 3.1416 (accurate to 5 significant figures). 355/113 = 3.1415929203539823... (accurate to 7 significant figures). . So which approximation you use depends on how accurate you need your final calculation to be.  The reason that 22/7 is often preferred over 3.14, besides the fact that it's sliiiiiiiiightly more accurate, is that if the quantity you're multiplying by is a multiple of 7 (which one out of every seven integers is ;-) ), then your approximation will be a nice round integer, which isn't really any better than a decimal value but is psychologically more pleasant!. . Hope that helps.

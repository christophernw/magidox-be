As you know wash your feet with warm soapy water every day and ensure they are dry. Use a blow drier on low heat to get the space between your toes very dry (it also feels good). Apply an athletes foot powder as directed to help keep your feet dry and kill any fungi. Fungi and bacteria are the cause of the odor. You should also consider changing your shoes and socks midway through your day. Also cleaning the inside of your shoes with mild soap and water will help but you must get all the soap out. Any soap residue could cause other problems such as irritation or allergic reaction. Lightly dust the inside of your shoes with the same powder you used on your feet. Always allow your shoes to dry completely before wearing them again, store them in a cool dry place with plenty of air circulation.. . One note on athletes foot powder. Try to stay clear of those that contain cornstarch. Cornstarch may provide a food source for the very fungi and bacteria you are trying to kill.. . Hope it helps.. . Sincerely,. Terry

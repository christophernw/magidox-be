If your cat is a male they seem to get a crystalization in their urinary tract from time to time. There are different cat foods out on the market (health food stores) that have dry cat food that helps the urinary tract to keep it in check. Ever since I put my male and females on the health food cat food they have been doing GREAT!!!!

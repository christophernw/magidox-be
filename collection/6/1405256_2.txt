Bifocal contacts used to be produced with a prism ballast to keep the lenses centered and at the proper orientation- not anymore.  Most hard contact lenses (RGP's) allow you to read just by the change in curvature that the lab manufactures onto the front and/or back of the lens.  Soft contact lenses have the near and distance Rx blended together- sounds difficult, but the vision can be great!

You cannot buy an apartment unit, only the entire building.  You can, however, buy a condo, townhome, co-op, duplex, tri-plex, quad-plex, etc.  You should contact a Realtor to help you search for a place.  If you qualify, you should be able to get a loan that is 100% financed, meaning you will not have to put money down, but will still have to pay closing cost, unless you get the seller to pay some or all of them for you or you finance them by adding them to the sales price of the property.

First of all the word is homosexuality and technically homosexuality is already allowed in our country, there is no law against it. If you mean culturally and socially accepting it I think a lot of people already do; your idea of only "allowing it for a 100 years" is ridiculous. Homosexuals find homosexuality the norm, they won't / can't turn themselves straight for a select few.

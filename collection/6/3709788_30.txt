Just because I don't believe in something, doesn't mean I want to be ignorant of the belief.  I would like to learn more about all religions, so I can better understand why people think and behave the way they do.  . . I'm not "bothered" by it, I'm just asking questions to gain knowledge.. . I also like intelligent and well-thought out debates.  I like to question things that are hard to explain, I like to pose ideas that get people thinking.  I've been having an ongoing discussion with a believer of God over Christianity for about three weeks now.  I rather enjoy our daily debates and talks.. . It's just something I like to do.

The simple answer is you can't unless you are prepared to keep telling him he's Mr Wonderful, handsome, gorgeous, the only one in the world for you etc. When I was younger, the man I eventually married was so jealous that he used to give me 'the third degree' if I ever spoke to another man, or if I was late from work. I loved him to bits but my life was hell at times. He used to accuse me of going with other men which I never, ever did. It took an illness which left me close to death to stop him being so stupid. I don't know how much you love your partner but your life won't be any picnic if you stick with him.

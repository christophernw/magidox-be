kids are supposedly playing these types of games now because it gives you some sort of high..these games are very dangerous and can cause death..you are messing with your hearth, lungs, and brain when doing these sort of things and 9 out of 10 times you may be fine, but all it takes is that one time to cause brain damage, irregular heartbeat, death..i wouldnt try it again

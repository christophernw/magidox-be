It depends what kind of case it was originally.  On more serious cases that are in the superior court (general jurisdiction), they will keep the record forever.  In the lower court (limited jurisdiction), the records are not kept forever.  Many have retention timeframe where the records are disposed of.  Check with the local court that the case originated from.

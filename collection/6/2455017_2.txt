During World War 1 and 2 the civilian population were subjected to food and fuel rationing. Other things the government did was to take over the civilian owned production facilities (In a since) of a company and changed the civilian production (I.E. Cars boats etc...) to build other military items(I.E. Tanks, weapons, bombers etc...). The government can (and has) recalled members of the military that have recently been discharged or retired, or has refused the discharge of or retirement of an individual due to man power shortages. That is just a small list, there are other things the government can by law do in times of war.

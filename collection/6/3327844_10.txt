What did Camilla do to their mother?  I think you will find that it was their father who was unfaithful to their mother.  The question would be better posed "why on earth and how on earth can william and harry forgive what the **** of Chales did to their mother?"  The answer is I don't know but we love our parents as they love us and we forgive them in our own way.

Scientologists don't believe that having a child out of wedlock is a sin as Christians believe.  In Scientology what's true is what's true for you and what you have observed to be true.. . Maybe having a child out of wedlock isn't right for you, but it's right for Tom and Katie.  That's the Scientologist point of view on it.

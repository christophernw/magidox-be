Stats say that many people are one paycheck away from homelessness.  Think about it, if you had to go on disability, what would you do for money?  What if you were in a bad car accident and couldn't work for a month- you have two weeks of sick leave and use it all up.  How would your bills /rent /mortgage get paid?  I live in Ohio a state that has one of the highest rates of the working poor in the United States.  We have people who have jobs who still don't make enough to pay all the bills.  Medical care is a BIG one.  Our health care system is one where we charge exorbitant amounts for care, and people go broke because they can't get out from under the bills.  . . My own father has barely escaped homelessness.  I'm thankful I'm able to help him.  He is not mentally ill or unskilled.  He worked in the steel mills which are mostly now defunct.  He was 'downsized' and had to find another job.  He tried to go to college, but his employer at the time lowered his wage to a 'student wage' and cut his hours.  Thus he couldn't go to school anymore.  He went back into sales full time and was downsized again at the age of 59.  No one wants to hire a man that age to do sales, so the only job he could find was that of security guard.  And they jack him around and don't pay him on time.  His check is repeatedly late- it was once 5 days late!  His boss told him he should budget better.  He almost lost his apartment, but it was his own fault.  What a load of crap.. . Back to your question, to prevent it, I think there need to be more advocates to help people get through all the traps out  there.

shoot dont trip, people might think that a "metro" is bad but its really not, i am metro and everyone i know would say the same thing, it doesnt mean your gay even though at times or first impression you might seem to be. i take longer than alot of my girlfriends to get ready it usually takes me about a hour and a half to 2 1/2 hours to get ready depending on the situation, and i match from head to toe to, my socks and underwear have to match my shirt, my shoes have to match and my pants have to match too. i go tanning get my nails done, hair cut atleast everyother weak, get my eyebrows waxes, shave most of my bode and it seems gay but i really just care about my looks and nothing wrong with being a metro

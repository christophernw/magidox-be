A voltaic cell is a device in which chemical energy is converted into electrical energy. Two dissimilar metals (like copper and zinc) are immersed in an electrolyte (for example a dissolved sulfate). If the metals are connected by an external circuit, one metal gains electrons while the other metal loses electrons. The difference in the potentials of the two metals provides the electric power of the cell. A car battery contains multiple voltaic cells wired together, while a plain old flashlight battery is a single voltaic cell. The voltaic cell is sometimes also called the galvanic cell.

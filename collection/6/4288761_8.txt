I truly admire your sentiments.  Why does your ex husband think he is owed money for the death of a baby.  This is sick.  The hospital did not cause your babies death - but as you so rightly say, have used it to try and help save thousands of other babies lives.  I know what they did, and how they did it might have been wrong but that is another story.. . He is obviously a greedy, grabbing, sad excuse for a man - I hope he does not get what he wants.. . Well done you and keep fighting whatever way you can.. . Please pass on our comments to your ex!

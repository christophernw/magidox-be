from another question, same info. this is a long answer. it started out as a way to demonize the chicanos/mexicans in the 1920s. then hemp became a threat to the cotton, paper, lamp oil & textile industries which led to the legislature of 1937 that outlawed hemp & cannabis. the rage of anti pot propaganda hit in the late 30s, 'refer madness' being the most seen. as an illegal, the revenues are monumental on both sides. heres where i come in. the pot trade supplies jobs for growers, transporters, smugglers, distributers, wholesalers & retailers. but on the other side; the lawers, courts, rehab relateds, confiscators (police auctions) & prisons also get paid. 'but man, it costs $50k to house each inmate per year'. WRONG. gist was an agriculture unit, we grew peas, cabbage, okra, onions & grain. the unit accross the way was a packaging unit. theres textile units that make the clothes & bedding out of the cotton other units grow. theres steel fabrication units, livestock units, manufacuring units, ect. we produce everything we use. we also produce free world goods that are sold as generic brands. we are an onsite free labor self preservation society. the economic structure that pot supplies is phenomenal. this is why the propaganda is inflicted. look how well propaganda & spin works; iraqs WMDs, the mexicans, terrorism, religions,...damn. the earth was said to be flat & the stars revolved around the earth. we still fall for the most ridiculous lies after all these millenia. those who can be made to believe absurdities can be made to committ attrocoties.

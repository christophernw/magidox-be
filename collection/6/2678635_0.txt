Siberians are allowed to have any color eyes, because eye color has/had nothing to do with their original function (endurance sled dog). Thus, people never selected for eye color when choosing which dogs to breed, and a number of eye colors became prominent in the gene pool.. . This is the same reason Siberians have so many different coat colors/patterns. When specific color genes aren't emphasized, you get a genetic range.

okay! only God can suppley your needs. i tell you this when dating if you cant see your self marrying the brother then don't date him. if you don't marry him and yall break you, thats eight years wasted and you could of been with some one else. were do you want to see your self two the three years from know. a man is going to do what you let him, you deserve better. girl i say and i know you might not want to here it but pray and give it to God because what needs to be remove from your life he will do it. ask God to give you winsdom and say if he is for me, he is for me and if not remove him.

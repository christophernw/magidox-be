I don't think people should stereotype either, unfortunately they do. Just look at some of the posts on here in the religion or race related catagories. So employers are just trying to eliminate some of that, I think. Tattoos used to be associated with people who were less than desirable as employees. I think that's all changing with the popularity of tattoos. So eventually, todays workforce gets older, I think you'll see a loosening of that stigma.

Dude--The Old Testement books were written hundreds of years before Jesus lived. I think the oldest books date back to around 1500 BC. As far as the New Testement, Jesus spent his short adult life--he was only about 32 when he was crucified--preaching the Word. And even then, nobody wrote down his story and his teachings until after he died. The earliest New Testement writings were from Paul, and those were around 10 years after Jesus died. Then came Mark (30 years after) Matthew (35-40 years) Luke (about 50 years after JC died) and finally Jonh, whose book was penned a good 80 years later.

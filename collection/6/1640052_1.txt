sure- it's easy- the refrigeration system moves heat out of one area into another- and simple experiment for you to do, is take a can of pressurized spray whatever, and spray it- can gets cold from reduction in pressure, allowing molecules space to "slow down" because they quit "bumping" from being in a tight spot- making room for more heat- or "making" cold- with me so far? now just picture a system with a pump that packs the gas molecules tightly together, and on the other end has a spot for them to expand (making room for more heat)and then runs the "heated" expanded gas through a radiator (heat comes out) and then gets compressed (packed) again- round and round "absorbs heat- moves heat- loses heat" .  hope this helps- if you really need more help email me through answers and I can provide pictures of how it works.

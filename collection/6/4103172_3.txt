Well, Jahmie and Sam H,. .  I hate to inform you of something. I did drop out at the age of 17. I'm not even close to being stupid. . . The reason I dropped out was so I could work full time to bring in money because my single father was injured and unable to work.. .  So please do not expect all of us dropouts to be stupid.

Sounds like ear mites. You can get a bottle of ear mite medication at Wal-mart (just dont buy the Hartz brand) and follow the directions on it. You will have to treat the ears daily for a couple of weeks. They are itchy to her, thats why she digs at them. The medication is around 5 bucks if I remember right...

I am Christian and I follow a simple rule... the law of God that says do unto others as you will have them do unto you.... hypocrite never.... I love and trust in God with every thing within me and every fiber of my being so I do what is pleasing to God and not to myself. I do not make provisions for the flesh..... but I am not perfect and I am still learning God's will, so as I go if I stumble if I do something not knowing... I repent daily, and I don't know about you but it feels good to know that I serve a God who is forgiving.

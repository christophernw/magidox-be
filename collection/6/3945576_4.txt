i agree with their advances. especially not to cheat 'coz u won't learn anything from it. and you'll just be relying onto someone's answer.. . another advice is to practice and keep on solving math problems. with these, the concepts would stick with you and you won't have a hard time solving any given problem sets.. . do your homeworks. as much as possible, try to answer them yourselves. you may want to ask for some help, but never rely on their answers, try to grasp of what help you got, and answer the problem yourself.. . good luck.

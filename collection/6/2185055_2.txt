USA got independence 1776, some hundred years ago , and since then it is in path of development.... . . Those countries most of them have their idependence in post 1920... not even a hundred years have passed .. Give em some time for development.. . They are rebuilding their nation form what is leftover..and most are not as blessed as America in Natural resourses. .  . Though if you look at progress curve what they have is steeper.

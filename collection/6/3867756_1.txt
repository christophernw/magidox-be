Remove the upper portion of plastic cowling around the fan (approx 6 bolts=four on top two on the joint that connects the top and bottom parts on the sides); loosten the belts on the pulleys and remove the belts...note or tag which one goes on which side; remove fan blade and keep the bolts somewhere safe. Remove radiator upper hour clamp at the pump and pull the hose off.  Remove water pump usually four bolts (who ever said they get rusty and break is full of it). Put new pump on by doing this all in reverse!

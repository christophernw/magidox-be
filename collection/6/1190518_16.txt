Are you crazy?  Eve was and is and was cast out.. No women are mentioned in the bible.  Eve had tons of girls none where mentioned.  This was thousands of years later that part of the bible was written.  So only those who were memorable for some reason were mentioned male or female.. Some women are mentioned but very few.  They were to busy having babies and that's about all they did.

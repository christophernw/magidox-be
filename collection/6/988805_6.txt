my sisters boyfriend graduated with a bachelors in journalism and every newspaper told him he needed 2-3 years experience so he had to take a job in montana at a smaller newspaper, where they need the help. you might have to make sacrifices like that(moving somewhere else) if you dont want an entry level job.

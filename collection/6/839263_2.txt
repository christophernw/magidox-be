Australia is roughly the same size as the US.  IF I asked you what the weather is like in the US what would you say?  You would probably ask where ......... Minnesota or Florida or Arizona and what time of year.  The answer is anywhere from freezing cold in the Tasmanian alps in June to so freakin' hot in the desert of western australia in February that you would not last more than a few hours outside.

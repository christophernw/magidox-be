First start with checking for brain, then open the can (with can opener), empty contents of can (peas) into bowl. Add black pepper and butter. Stick in microwave (the half empty coffee cup holder in kitchen). Set timer for 2:30-3:00. Then once your able to differentiate between the ringing in your head and the beeping coming from the microwave, remove bowl from microwave. After picking up the bowl and peas off the ground repeat steps all the way though to remove bowl from microwave, just don't burn yourself this time. You're welcome.

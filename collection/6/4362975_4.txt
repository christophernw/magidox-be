Because I am doing it even now.  Jesus has called us to tell others about the Good News, what they do with the information I give them is entirely up to them, I wish that they would coonsider it though!!  If I start getting the response that you are addressing in your question, I know i'm doing my job as a Christian! And, if you are an athiest reading this and laughing your head off, just know that, even though you've probably heard it a thousand plus times and you'll disregard it as a cliche, Jesus does love you, and wants you to become a Christian.  If you don't get it know, you will someday, I just pray it won't be to late!!!  God Bless!!

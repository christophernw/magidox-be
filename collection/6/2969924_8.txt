Well, the GED (general equivalency diploma) is always an option.  While that may not be what you are looking for, my ex-husband has a GED, and he is now in his third year of medical school, so there's nothing wrong with doing it that way.. . If you want to take classes, it amy be more difficult, but you can contact your local community college and see what they offer.  I know not all schools do this, but in Jacksonville, FL, for example, they have a high school completion program (at FCCJ) in which you actually take classes and get a regular diploma.  The schedule is very flexible (i.e., you can do it even if you have children).  There were teachers (so you have one-on-one help if you need it), but the program was somewhat self-paced.  I think it is a great alternative if it is available in your area.

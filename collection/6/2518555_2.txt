Well, I got a 32 on the one and a 1350 on the other, so I guess I qualify.  The gifts I was born with were given to me from God, and that was no doing of mine, so I have nothing to be proud of.  I would just say that if you're given much, then much is expected of you.  And you really shouldn't insult Midwesterners.  I'm not one (I live in the South), but that was a tasteless thing to say.

He picked on lots of minorities.  He targeted vast numbers of gypsies too.  But he picked on Jews because they were an easy target for a scapegoat.  After WWI, which Germany lost, they got hit witht the full cost of the war.  Of course, this was such a large debt that Germany had no hope of repaying it.  They printed money as quickly as they could, but that only made the value of that money go down extremely quickly.  With so much chaos, Hitler offered the Germans a solution: blame the Jews.  And it worked.  Germans were so ready to find an excuse for all that had gone wrong that they made Hitler their leader and, well, the rest is history.

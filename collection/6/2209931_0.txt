The term has nothing to do with race, it refers to a woman who enjoys skiing.  It's similar to the term "snowbird" but the meaning is entirely different.  Snowbirds are folks who live in the frigid American Northeast who winter in Florida or one of the other states in the deep south of the U.S. where winter is mild enough to permit shorts and t-shirts year round.

This happens to everyone.  Even Paul in the Bible said that he always did the things that he hated doing and battled with it.  You have made a habit of those things you dislike or make you feel bad.  The best way to uncondition yourself is to immediately interrupt that pattern when it starts.  If you start thinking something you don't like, change your state (moving the body is powerful) by doing something like jumping up and shouting "YES! I AM HAPPY" and try to feel happy, confident whatever good feeling.  Eventually that bad habit or pattern will be diluted and you can replace it with a good one.. . For a very much more comprehensive on this powerful tactic, listen to Anthony Robins Personal Power II.  IT IS AWESOME.

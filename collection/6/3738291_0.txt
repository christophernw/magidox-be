Ninhydrin, (Triketohydrindane hydrate) is a chemical used to detect ammonia or primary amines. When reacting with these free amines, a deep blue or purple color is evolved. Ninhydrin is most commonly used to detect fingerprints, as amines left over from peptides and proteins (terminal amines or lysine residues) sloughed off in fingerprints react with ninhydrin.

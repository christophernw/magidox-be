Actually, German, French, Italian, Polish...they're all considered to be "ethnic" cusine and from Europe. It's considereded "ethnic" in the U.S. because it is traditionally from another region & not something commonly served in a U.S. household. It can't be called "foreign" because that would be politically incorrect.........I guess. Whatever the reason, this country wouldn't be what it is today if it weren't for our wonderful blend of so many ethnic foods!

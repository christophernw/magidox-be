you must show your portfolio first..it could be a hardcopy or a neat presentation in clear books and photographs don't forget to indicate the title of the work, size, dimensions, medium..sometimes disk copies of jpeg formats of the pictures of your works...depends on the gallery...if they will approve... that's when you get to go on a show or exhibit.

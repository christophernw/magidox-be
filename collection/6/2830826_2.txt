high blood sugar is diabetes.when the numbers are high then they drop to low ,your sugar is dropping so eat something sweet. also if you were checked at the dr. by blood work go back and tell them you request to have a suger glucose test done to ease your mind . it is more acurate than blood work. good luck with that

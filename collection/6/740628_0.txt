moth balls will help a bit. there are actually very few plants which effectively deter cats so not worth even trying that.. but a thickly planted garden wont give them the opportunity. . best think is before you plant to lay chicken wire on the ground and cut later holes to plant things in, you can lightly cover it with dirt or mulch.... . also dont be afraid to catch any stray cats and take them to the animal shelter or pound.  In most cities it is illegal for pets to roam so this is the best deterant

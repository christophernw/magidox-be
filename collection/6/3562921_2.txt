Difficult to do. You need an publishing agent to contact book companies for you. THEY will not respond if you write directly to them. Another way is to find book publishers on the internet that will print your books if you want to pay to have the books printed.. . Another outlet is to go to ALLEXPERTS and become a volunteer. They have a lot of positions open and there is a LOT of people out there looking for help. It can be very beneficial when you help others that are desperately looking for someone to help them.. . Sorry about your terrible losses.

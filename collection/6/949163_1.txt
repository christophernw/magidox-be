Start looking at it as more than a chore. Realize how much you actually do use it on a day by day basis...e.g. It's 10 miles away from your friend's house.... if you drive, how long will it take to get there?  A shelf holds 50 Lbs. You have 10 boxes that weigh 25 Lbs. How many will the shelf support. A job pays $15.00 per hour for 25 hours per seek. That sort of stuff.. . Then begin to realize how much math it took to design or manufacture all of the things you love.. . Almost anything that you see, hear, use, etc. can be explained with mathematics. Just investigate and try to learn a bit of it at a time. Albert Einstein once said that if you want to become an expert at something, you could do so in time, with just 15 minutes per day. Try it out and see if it works.

I think the major reason student drop out is because they party too much.  Yes college is a time to have fun and be on your own, but most of the kids I know who couldn't make it, drank way too much, got behind on work, and dropped out because they were doing so poorly.  Other reasons.. home sickness, illness, realizing college isn't for them, not liking their major and just giving up, and so many more.

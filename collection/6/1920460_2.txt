you know, that is true.. I wear it to keep vampires and blood suckers away.. didn't think of it that way.  I think it would be harder to see. nails and hammer.  or a spear.  or any weapon for that matter.. the cross is a symbol of the burden of the Lord.  Remember that . noone defended him, not one.  But his mother and James and Mary Magdalen.. Simon and Simone helped by carrying and bringing water, the rest ran, betrayed, and denied.. oh and the victory is in the rising of the Lord and that noone can kill God.. sound familiar today/

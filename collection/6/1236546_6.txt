Boundaries. It is important to know when doing good for others would cripple them or make them dependent on others.  Ask yourself, is this something that this person would feel good about themselves if they would do this for themselves?  If they are unable to do for themselves, it is the right thing to do it for them.  But if they need to start learning to do for themselves, then your "no", thus setting a boundary, could help them to realize they need to do it for themselves.

First of all, smoking not only harms you but also the others who may not welcome it (thru second-hand related diseases). Moreover, smoking is a disease that denies you to be a healthy  being because it might kill you. For example, in the U.S. about 440,000 deaths/year that is directly related to smoking. Think about it, it is a disease that can be prevented and you MUST STOP if you think this is horrific and you MUST STOP if you LOVE yourself.

training, you have to train dog.. . sounds like dog is starving for attention.. be sure you are giving him enough.. . dog has to earn privilge to be in house, if it acted up like you said, I would have put STOP to it before he kept it up.. you may try putting leash on him, keep YOU in contol of dog, when company comes over.

When I got baptized (submersed in water at the age of 13, then again at the age of 46) I felt new and whole. I didn't understand that much when I was a teen. But at 46 I gave my life totally. I felt something like warm water pour over me. It wasn't the ice cold water they dipped me in either. I was filled with the holy spirit.. Baptism alone won't get you into heaven. Jesus said "if you are ashamed to confess me before men, I won't confess you before my Father which is in heaven".

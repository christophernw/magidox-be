Drink decaffeinated coffee and tea.  Read the labels on soft drinks before buying.  Most colas are caffeinated, but so are other soft drinks.  It's a good idea to get into the habit of reading the labels on all food and beverages that you intend to consume, not just for caffeine content, but also for carbs, calories, saturated and trans-fat and other nutritional information.

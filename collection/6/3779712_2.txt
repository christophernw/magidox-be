A tax return is the taxpayers accounting procedure to prove that they have paid their taxes for the year in question.  . . If the taxpayer works for someone else and their employer took out more than the employee owes than the taxpayer is owed a refund. They get their refund by sending their tax return in by April 15 of each year. . . If the taxpayer owns their own business, earns enough interest in taxable investments and/or did not have enough money from his/her paycheck than the taxpayer owes money to the government and has to send it in by the April 15 deadline.

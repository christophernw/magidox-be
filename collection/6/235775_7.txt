Close your eyes and relax your lips so they are just barely parted.  Now, follow your partner's lead.  Try not to lean in and press too hard, just make gentle contact.  Moist but without drool or slobbers feel free to pull back just a bit to swallow or lick your lips while maintaining eye contact.  Stay relaxed and you'll be fine. Good luck and congratulations!

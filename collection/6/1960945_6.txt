Its really strange - I have cancer and have a limited period to live. I am not scared of death as I know where I am going thanks to an out of body experience I had during one of my many surgeries. Everyone is under the notion that smoking causes cancer - be it lung or oral or anything. You can go through any website and you will see that no doctor has ever had conclusive proof that smoking causes cancer. Yes, I agree its bad for ones system as it does create breathing problems etc. at a later stage in life but again as I said noone has been able to prove that smoking is the cause of the illness. I poured through websites and finally opted for radiation and chemo ( thats another story). The source of my cancer ( though I was smoking 30/40 cigarettes a day as my job stress levels were at their peak) was not the smoking but "voice abuse". I for one had never imagined that there could be anything called cancer due to voice abuse and the doctor asked me right away what my cellular bill was every month and how many cellulars I carried. She was shocked when I showed her a copy of my bill(appox.9500 $ per month per cellular! - no jokes at all) and told me again that there was no doubt that it was due to voice abuse.

Well its probably too late now to really do anything unless u declaw , but I don't suggest that, I've read studies on what they do to declaw and I would never do that to my cat! Would you want to have somebody rip your nails out of your fingers? SO.. I've tried all that there is.. the sprays on the chairs and scents cats hate.. nothing works.. not even spraying the cat with water works (my cat likes water) slap on the butt, loud noise.. nothing works.. Got rid of the chesterfield that he did it to instead of the cat.. Just left his favorite chair and footstool that he likes.. he leaves everything else alone. Best thing to do is when you first get a kitten is to teach them to use a scratching post right from the start..

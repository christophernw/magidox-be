I don't beleive the universe without devine guidance could evolve itself into such a perfectly functioning ecosystem.  Change one thing about the way the earth rotates, the position of the sun, the pull of the moon on the tides of the ocean and we would have an entire systematic failure. No way mother nature is always in perfect harmony like this.

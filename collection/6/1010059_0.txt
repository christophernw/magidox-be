Stock represents ownership in a company. When you buy a share of stock you own a little piece of the company. If the company does well and makes money, you get a piece of that either through the stock price going up or a dividend. A lot of different factors determine the price of the stock so its impossible to say for sure that the value will go up or down. Shares of stock are traded on exchanges or in the over the counter market. Either way you can buy and sell stock through your stock broker or open your own account on-line. Owning shares of stock also entitles you to vote for the board of directors, the people who oversee the running of the company.

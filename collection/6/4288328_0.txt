I have one and i play it like for 5 hours a day and when it over heats nothing happens, i think the only down fall of the ps2 slim is that when i had the other one i used to put games ontop , and now i cant because when you open it it rises. in the reg ps2 it was bigger and if you noticed there was like alot of little vents and alot of dust got in my ps2 and broke that happened to me twice, but i had a gurantee=) and the slim has small vents . but i think they are all the same , if it works be happpy.

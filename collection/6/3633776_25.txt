Christians believe in evolution.  Catholics and Jewish people accepted Darwin's theories with no conflicts to the Bible.. . It's RANDOMISM that is the controversey.. . Randomism, if I may be a facitious extremist, is buying a bunch of electronic parts at Radio Shack, putting them into a box, giving them to Monkeys and having them shake them for 1 billion years.. . Radominsts say you will get a fully functioning X Box if you do that long enough.. . That is the concept that is hard to swallow!. . We have a hard time understanding how ANYONE can accept that we are here due to serendipity!. . Even Einstein didn't agree with that concept!  He said "God doesn't play craps!"

Darwin's theory, though flawed, is still the best theory: . Reason?  Darwin's theory has been TESTED.  There are many thousands of papers that poke and prod the theory, adapting it, changing it, even refuting it!  Still, however, no one has come up with a better one that can be tested.. Creationism has absolutely NO tests proving it exists or doesn't...what's more, it CAN'T be tested...clever priests, huh?  Come up with a theory that no one can test and declare it truth.  They've made a lot of money on that.

Perhaps you cooked him in a little too much garlic and chillies......next time just marinate him for a few hours and then lightly grill him before putting him between the bread.. . Not as tasty, but no more cramps!!!. . Have you tried an elephant sandwich?  . . You sure need a large loaf for that one!

Fudge is a type of confectionery, usually extremely rich and often flavored. It is made by boiling sugar in milk to the soft-ball stage, and then beating the mixture while it cools so that it acquires a smooth, creamy consistency.. . American folk lore has it that fudge was invented in the United States more than 100 years ago. The exact origin is disputed, but most stories claim that the first batch of fudge resulted from a bungled batch of caramels made on February 14, 1886â€”hence the name "fudge."

Have you asked the Author to help you understand?  If you read book (any book) and you don't understand it - then the best place to seek understanding would be to go to the Author himself.  God is the Author of the Bible, have you asked Him to give you understanding.  As for physical evidence, that's where Faith comes in!  I know the different books were written by different men of the Bible, but every single man was moved by ONE SPIRIT - GOD!  Ask the Author and see what happens!

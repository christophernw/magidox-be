Our minds can interact with nature if you will open your senses of awareness towards nature...the value of Mother Nature and it's relation to us in this symbiotic existence.Many life's hard-earned lessons are learned from nature. Amidst life turbulent trials, one can look into a typhoon devastated tree...after its branches are broken...a new sprout of new leaves begin to appear...and very beautiful at that...a symbol of new hope...a new beginning. After a turbulent storm...the sun will give its shining glory...with an extra bonus...of a magical rainbow. That is also how life must be...though always tried and tested with tribulations...still...there is a ray of hope...for you...for me...and for all of us to have a brighter tomorrow ahead. While there's life...there's hope!

Realize that most Americans are not atheist, but many are agnostics or deists.  . . Atheist believe that there is no God and they are sure that there is no God.. . Agnostics believe that we cannot possibily know whether there is or isn't a God.. . Deist believe that God created the universe and then left it to its own end.  Unfortunatly, most Americans live as if this is their belief.

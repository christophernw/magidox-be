OH, HAVE I EVER!  My foot slipped off an edge and landed perhaps 15 inches lower.  Suddenly my leg was pointing forward and my foot was at a right angle to it....Not a pretty sight!  Twelve or 14 fractures required surgery to put in a plate and a bunch of screws...and two more surgeries to take same out and rework a nerve.  Decidedly waaaaayyyy too much fun!  Oh yes, did I forget to mention:  I was wearing a skimpy nighty and knew all the firemen(6), paramedics(2), and Sheriffs (5), who answered the 911 call...I worked with them!

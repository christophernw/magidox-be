Hemiplegia is motor weakness on one side of the body, and Hemiparetic tremors are the uncontrollable shaking affecting the limbs on one side of the body. The third part of your question is incomplete, but I'm going to take a guess that the word may be Hemianopia?  This is defective vision or blindness that impairs the normal field of vision of one eye.  All three terms are associated with Cerebral Palsy.

Take a couple of pain killers and the pain should go away because sometimes its just a twinge of pain that most people i think get and it should go by the time the drugs have worn off if its still there ring the dentist and get an appointment asap and dont eat anything that could make it worse such as sweets or fizzy drinks. Drink water and stick to soft foods.

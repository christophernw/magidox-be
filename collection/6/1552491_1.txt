HAZMAT stands for Hazardous Materials. The crew has equipment such as (but not neccesarily including) radiation-proof uniforms to handle dangerous materials. The sign on a truck or near a dump means that there are dangerous materials there. The materials must be handled with caution, and Hazmat crews have been trained to handle them.

The only options that you apparently have left is to either to visit your Iriver customer service internet site and if you don't get the help/answers you are looking for than I would be going back to the store where you purchased your Iriver and asking for either a full refund or at best an exchange!!!  The store's policy should convenience your situation as best as possible.

Did some of the answerers read the whole question?  The writer is asking as a TEACHER, not a child.. . Second, I also teach 5th grade, and if you have a real solution, post it everywhere.  I am going to assume you teach in an area where it is accepted not to come to school.  Some places it is a given.  I have been teaching in the inner city for 27 years, from K-6 and haven't figured it out yet.  At the beginning of the school year we have an open house.  The only time we got ANY participation was when we had a cookout for them and they came for the free food.  I have often thought about having a parent conference and advertising free food.  I honestly think it might work.. . Failing the "little buggers" doesn't work.  They don't care.. . One of the biggest problems is that a lot of parents have memories of bad school experiences.  They absolutely hate the thought of going into a school.  It makes them feel stupid.. . Also we have a lot of parents who really don't consider education as something they need/needed and don't think it will do anything for their children either.  It isn't something they value.. . Out school has tried raffling off DVD players, computers, all kinds of things.  They just had to come to school and each time they would get to fill out a raffle ticket.  It didn't help.  The people who always came, still came, they others didn't.. . GOOD LUCK!

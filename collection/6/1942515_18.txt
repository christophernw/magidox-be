run, bike, exercise!  that's the only way you're going to get rid of that fat!  oh, and don't eat right before bed.  and watch what you eat.  you can't eat chocolate bars all day long and expect to lose any weight.  even if you do exercise.  you can also try some weight lifting with your legs.  anything that works your legs is going to help.

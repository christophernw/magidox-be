You have to go and wait in line.  It's a long process.  You first audition for staffers, who may or maynot hold you for a comeback then, if you make it through them, you get to audition in front of the judges.  . . Which really p/o off since my niece who has audition several times, sings professionally in niteclubs has yet to get past the staffers for whatever reason (they have called her back a couple of times) and you see these idiots performing on the show in front the judges.

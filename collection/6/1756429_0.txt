I've been on the pills 5 years, plenty long enough for them to take effect. I also undergo cognative behavioral therapy once a week and I still deal with deep depression and hopelessness. I recently got a puppy and that keeps me distracted a little and gives me a reason to get out of bed. Nothing is going to cure me and I have had to accept that. It also helps a little to think back on my chaotic life before meds and remember how very much worse I was then. But there is no cure all.

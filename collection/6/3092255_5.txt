NO! PEOPLE IT'S NOT THE FRIGGIN DIRT!!.  My dog does this too but not just the couch, the bed, pillows, his leg. He will lick a huge wet spot where ever he feels like it! I thought it was the same as what a cat would do before it sleeps. Sometimes they clean their selves right before they sleep but it has nothing to with dirty stuff. They do this for 5 10 mins it seems, I've sat next to and watched my dog lick his leg in a slow rythmic fashion for almost 10 mins, I finally stopped him. I hope you and I find out the reason for it!

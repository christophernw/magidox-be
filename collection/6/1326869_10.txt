No one 'believes' in evolution, its's science.  Science is not something you can and can't believe in like a religion, its something that is or isn't supported by evidence and hence in overwhelming probability did or didn't happen.  Evolution falls into the former of the two.. . Just as an idea of the amount of evidence for evolution, the number of peer reviewed papers (i.e. evidence open to criticism from other academics) on evolution published each week by far dwarfs the number on any other origin theory (intelligent design etc) ever published.

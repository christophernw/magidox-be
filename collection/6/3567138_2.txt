De-worming as a rule refers to intestinal worms like roundworm or hookworm or tape worm usually ingested by the pet with affected food or by licking other animals. Heart worms are found in the blood stream and/or heart and are transmitted by mosquitoes. The term prevention says it all though............you PREVENT your animal from getting sick. . You deworm an animal that already has a problem with worms.

This like the pot  calling the kettle black.  You Democrats started the name calling and venom spitting. I have not seen any personal attacks by Republicans at all.  But I have seen a lot by you guys.  Maybe I lead sheltered life or something.  . . And if you get a hold of the government, who is the first terrorist you will suck up to? . . Or will it just be "Cut and Run?"   Then hide your head in the sand until another Republican or Independent comes along to clean up your mess?. . To survive, this country has to be strong. You would turn it into a neutered dog.. . Pacifism does not work!  And when will your news media allow our troops to be heard? Wake up!

Seriously, in general, crimes are things that affect or hurt other people, like murder, stealing, rape, etc.  Homosexuality is just two guys or two girls gettin' their love on.  That doesn't hurt anyone at all, unless you're among the MANY brainwashed religious freaks with whom I'd love to argue with in person so I could make them look like a COMPLETE idiot.  Basically, homosexuality doesn't hurt anyone else (with a brain) and that's why it's not a felony.  Can we say "DUH"?

I'm afraid that you're not going to be able to change anything. He was litterbox trained, and, to him, that's that. Rabbits are super clean animals, and instinclively use only selected spaces to use as a bathroom.I strongly suggest putting the litterbox back, no matter how much of a hassle it was (isn't what you're going through more of a hassle???).. By the way, rabbits should NOT have grated cages... it's really horrible for their feet, as they don't have pads to protect them.

I am atheist, so I will not enter in religiosity, just hard facts. . . First of all the first reason of prejudice and attack against Jews is the Bible. And most western countries have at least a "Christian" culture and some knowledge of the Bible. The founder of Christianity was Jesus Christ, who in that story was killed by Jews. Truth or Lie, I am not the one to answer, and anyway people are so stupid nowadays to think and go beyond the importance of historical fossils like the Bible.. . Second, you Jews, with the problem of not having a country for many centuries, had to adapt and get smart in any place you went, having the hardest of all. And you learned. . And were THE BEST. After so much very hard practice, you became the best in any country you were, this raising the envy of the natives or locals, that is the second reason of envy coming after you.. . Third, and more recently, your Nemesis and most Vile Satan against you: Hitler and the Nazis. And more recently Neonazis.. . The fourth is the imposition of the UN as of giving the Jews a country which was already occupied by people who had no responsibility for the terrible crimes commited to your people in WW2. You should have been given a very big piece of Germany.. . This all combines and there you have your reason. I do not attack Jews, however, and have some friends who are Jews...

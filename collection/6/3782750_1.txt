Waylon is only partially right.  Human slavery has gone on for as long as humans have had civilization and pre-dates the Roman Empire.. . And it wasn't just "blacks"  nearly every race and ethnicity has been enslaved at one time or another in our history.. . And blaming the Spanish on enslaving Africans is just short-sighted.  Other ruling and warring Africans are the ones that entered into other states/nations/villages and kidnapped people to use in slavery.   The "Spanish" did not go into the heart of Africa and do this on their own, they would have been slaughtered by warriors.  . . Segregation occured after the civil war was over.   When the South lost the war and their world, they rebelled against Federal law by enacting "whites only" laws and crap.  Thank god people like Martin Luther King had the guts to stand up and say "this isn't right".

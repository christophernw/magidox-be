when my girls were young i read to them all the time...Take him to a bookstore or library and let him pick out any books he wants and read to him every night...or better yet have him read to you...kids need and want that quality time and hell be learning in the process...also make sure that he knows his basics...letter pronunciation could be the problem or even dyslexia..good luck

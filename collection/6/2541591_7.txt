I feel exactly the same way. I seems you can't ask a question without one or two rude and obnoxious answers. People just don't care sometimes. A little while ago I asked a question about my husband and his messiness. One guy told me I should kill myself and called me a miserable B word. I used to let things like that get to me at at first it did a little. I then decided to visit some of his questions. You wouldn't believe what I found. He was asking how to get away with murdering his wife. I told him that he needed some serious help. Too many sickos in the world. Sickos and rude people. I must say though that I gt more sincere answers then I do rude ones so the nice people are still in the lead. Thank God for that. Take care.

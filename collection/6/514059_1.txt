I don't believe in a god...not in the sense that most do...I'd say about the only way I could believe in god would be if he or she were an alien life form.....thus making him or her not a true creator of the universe which I belive to be more likely the big bang theory as it is....and I believe in evolution...I wouldn't even go so far as to call that a theory because I don't believe it is just a theory anymore...I am pretty sure it is factual and that it is scientifically proven...but hey as far as humanities state of being I'd say as a whole our state of being nowdays isn't very humane....indeed we are just humans and we live in a fragile balance of things for the simple fact that desperate times and situations can make monsters out of very very large groups of people...for example all of those who followed Hitler because he promised them a solution to their food shortage crisis and how their are still people who support the Nazi way still to this very day.....Jesus Christ was crucified on a cross and stoned and whipped and just basically tortured to death not so much in that order but because he laid claim to being the true son of god or the incarnation of....either way everybody could have just laughed at him and made a mockery of him and treated him like the village idiot but instead they did something horribly cruel and inhumane to a truly good person....Socrates was forced to drink poison because he got people to think....another example the KKK and the hatred and the racsim that they promote....and then there is the good ol usa....from the time the  pilgrims set foot on this soil we began slaughtering the indians of this nation to nearly wiping them off the face of the planet....and then we enslaved africans because we were to lazy to do our own work....and that is really pathetic.....and on up to our current day and age government.....they are ruled by lies and deciet and their sole motvation is greed....greed to a point which is truly and utterly disgusting....for those of you with open eyes and minds and hearts to the truth you know that this is true of our government.....if you can say otherwise your a damn liar yourself....or niave and ignorant....needless to say mankind has never been very humane as a whole and I doubt we ever will be....at least in this world there are some humane people.....it's just so unfortunate that the rest of the world is such a cruel place

The essence of being a student is to open ones mind to the institution of learning -- (this does not just mean sitting in a classroom with a book, and a desk and a teacher... you can also be a student of life.)  One does not stop learning until they die... therefore, we are all learning, which makes us all students.... don't ya just feel like ya shmucked your face on the doorologic at times??? This too is the essence of being a student.

Unfortunately in this society sex sells - Sex is a natural process and feeling for human beings because God made the provision for a married husband and wife to share exclusively - however because society has clued in that we are sexual beings it uses a distorted view to exploit something that was meant to be pure and chaste shared only between a man & wife that have committed themselves to one another - It's really ironic that  you aksed the question because sex is advertised EVERYWHERE but no one seems to understand why the teenage pregnancy rate is at an alarming high rate...or that STDs are being spread at a ridiculous rate...go figure. Society has love confused with lust which defined is fulfilling a legitimate need in an illegitimate way.  Hope this helps

There are clinics that can zap the hair follicles and permanently damage the hair producing mechanism. It is very expensive, but, it is also very permanent. You'll probably spend more on wax and shaving throughout your life. Look up lazer hair removal, I'm sure there a lot of ressources out there. I think there might also be hormonal treatments that you can look into.

I do not for a minute believe that everyone in the world is calling Fundamentalist Muslims Terrorist's.  At least that is the way that I read your question.  I think that most people feel that a Majority of Terrorist's are from an extremist faction of the Muslim religion that is in fact very small.  However with terrorist acts in the News daily it is felt that there are more terrorists out there than we thought and people begin to think that every Muslim is somehow involved.  One reason for this is that many Muslims do not speak out against these few extremists that are giving all a bad name.  Possibly they don't speak out because of the same fear that we have, however because they don't speak out it seems to be guilt by association.. . Just in the way that you phrase your question tells me that you have the same concepts of us as you are accusing us of having against you.

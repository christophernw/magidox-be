Now are you refering to those of us who "live" in the U.S.? Because for someone as technical as you appear to be "Americans" can actually refer to those in North, South, & Central America!! Although most of the common world can figure out what an American refers to just as easily as what a bathroom is and moreso what I'd be going in there to do!!

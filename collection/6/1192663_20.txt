because a bright guy knows an idiot when he sees one, only an idiot would look at another idiot and think well gee that's a pretty smart guy there, the man doesn't talk,carry, or present himself like he has any brains about him what so ever, and considering his popularity polls are down to what right now? 30% or somewhere around there? so the rest of the world that thinks he isn't doing such a good job is at around 70% obviously, I am quite sure a lot of those people that don't think he is doing such a good job probably also think he is an idiot or not so bright as you would say, so what makes you think that he is a very bright person?

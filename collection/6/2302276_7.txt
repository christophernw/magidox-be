Not sure why, but I think you are about the only country left that doesn't do Celcius.  Canada (where I am) has been Celcius for quite a few years now, as well as centemeters & millimeters.  Because I am from the 'old school, I still don't understand and have to calculate to know when buying a turkey or roast.  Hope the U.S. soon catches up with the rest of us.  It's not like you to be last at doing anything

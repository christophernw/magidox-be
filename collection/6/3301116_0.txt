Life is a pass/fail test for the soul.  Whether or not you believe in cosmic justice, it pays to behave as though you do, and live your life with the most noble virtues possible.  If reincarnation is true, or if heaven/hell reward/punishment is true, or if there really is no afterlife at all, I still think we are better off trying to do right rather than reaching for power and material wealth to the detriment of others.

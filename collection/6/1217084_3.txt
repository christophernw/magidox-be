Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a versatile Gram-negative bacterium that grows in soil, marshes, and coastal marine habitats, as well as on plant and animal tissues. People with cystic fibrosis, burn victims, individuals with cancer, and patients requiring extensive stays in intensive care units are particularly at risk of disease resulting from P. aeruginosa infection.

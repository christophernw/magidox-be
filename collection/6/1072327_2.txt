It's you hateful liberals that keep saying this is an unwinnable war, giving strength to our enemies.  Oh yeah, you say we had no enemies in Iraq.... . Zarqawi was already in Iraq training his Al Qaeda buddies.  Maybe we should have just let all this slide, ya' know?  Like Bill Clinton always did with Bin Laden.  We should have allowed Saddam continue to hide HUNDREDS or even THOUSANDS of lethal munitions, continue to deceive the world and erode sanctions while he seeked to rebuild his nuke capabilities.  . . Do you have any knowledge of history and all the countries we have helped to overcome tyrannical dictators?  To obtain peace, you must prepare for war?  Ever heard of that?  . . Why do you think that having our troops in Iraq would keep us from preventing terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda?  Do you realize that it's not our troops that foil the attacks on our homeland?  It's intelligence, yes, such as monitoring the terrorists' internet use, phone records, etc.  Oh yeah, you libs are against that too..  Wake up and realize YOU are the one who is too stupid to understand what it takes to protect ourselves against terrorism.  You tie our hands.

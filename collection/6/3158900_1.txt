People steal for a lot of different reasons.  Most of them do it because they don't have the money to buy the merchandise. Others do it because they are angry at the store or the workers for something that was said or done to them.  Then there are the people who just don't need a reason & when they get caught, they can't even think of a reason why they did it, they usually suffer from some form of an addiction which drives them to steal.

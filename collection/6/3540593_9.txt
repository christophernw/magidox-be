Sometimes life experience is more important that IQ. Give the teach some credit.. . But also some teachers don't like kids acting (or even being) smarter than them. They'll do things their way just to prove they're in charge. Ego's are an ugly thing.. . But don't you get a big EGO to go with that IQ.. People don't like egos and often wont listen to somebody when they act like they're better than you. It would be a shame to have such a high IQ and so much knowledge and not have anybody listen to you.. . Good Luck!

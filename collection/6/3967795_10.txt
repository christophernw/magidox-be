Jaguar XKR, beacuse it's sexy, sleak and seductive!. Also for the men, it has huge horsepower, sounds like a beast and goes like shit of a shovel, lol.. . Or apply now for the new Bristol Fighter T, there only making 20 a year and the first batch comes out mid next year, there made in Bristol and it will be the fastest road car EVER.. . Come on Bristol, that's car and flight done, if you didn't know Concord was invented, designed and built in Filton, Bristol  :-)

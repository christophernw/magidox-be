its usualy found in sports cars and small trucks like a mustang, camaro, trans am, ranger,or s10 just to name a few. it have six cylenders and six spark plugs were as an 8 cyl had 8 spark plugs and a four cyl can eather have 4 spark plugs or 8. they get decent gas milage and they are fairly quick were as an 8 cyl is quicker but it sucks down gas and a 4 cyl is quite the oposite of an 8, 6 is like a happy medium.

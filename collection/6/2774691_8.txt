The true keys to success exist in being able to submit yourself to the rules of whatever it is you're seeking to become successful in. Discipline and maintain good moral character is a start along with making yourself so familliar with what you're into that it almost becomes an actual part of you. Save your money, establish an investment plan and live according to your means. Stay away from drugs and alcohol and most importantly, Never ever forget God and where you came from. Be good to yourself, Be good to people. God Bless you.

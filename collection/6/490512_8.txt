I had the very same issue, I was drinking so much coke I was starting to stay sick. I decided to slowly take myself off coke by keeping bottled water with me all times.If you are thirsty enough you  will drink the water, I also keep plenty of tea made to drink and I reward myself with 1 Coke a week now.

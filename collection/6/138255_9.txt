Oil undergoes thermal breakdown due to high operating temperature. When this occurs, the oil becomes less effective as a lubricant. And without a good lubricant (read: expensive), parts of the engine rub together and wear each other out.. . . You'll need some type of oil-filter wrench; here are two sizes of socket-style cap wrenches â€” one fitted to an oil filter and the other to a 3/8-inch-drive breaker bar handle.. Oil also contains additives that have the ability to neutralize acids. Over time, these additives get used up and stop being effective.. . Finally, oil can absorb water, dust and combustion byproducts and also hold them in suspension. Eventually, the oil gets saturated with this stuff and can't absorb any more. Then that stuff remains in the engine and can cause corrosion.. . What happens if I don't do this?. Your engine won't last as long as it could. Oil serves many crucial functions, and clean oil performs those functions better than dirty oil. Oil is relatively cheap, and changing your oil every 5,000 miles is a very cheap insurance policy against major repairs down the road.

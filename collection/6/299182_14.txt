Definitely DON'T feed them, then they will never go away!! And the dog thing won't necessarily work, stray cats are used to big animals. I'd say get them and take them to a shelter, but make sure they don't belong to anyone else. and don't shot them cause that's not nice, you can shot near them but don't shot them!! make sure that your garbage is all packed away in cans, and there is nothing on the ground around them,if you have a barn make sure there isn't any thing they can eat in it, and make sure that there is no place in the barn for them to make a home. Hope this Helped, Good luck!!

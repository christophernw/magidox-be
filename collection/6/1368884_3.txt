It doesn't always happen that easily, though it seems that way, doesn't it? I know a brand new church in our community just received a loan to fix up an old church building. It took a long time for that loan to go through. They still wouldn't be able to do it, except some members have connections to electrical needs and lumber needs. I believe some places will use churches as a tax write-off, too. You can't write off a normal person, but a church is fair game. I think the loan process is pretty fair, it doesn't matter how prepared you are, if you have the right connections it will be easy.

To me he means peace and protection. Knowing that when I am struggling financially the money always shows up and when I am having a terrible day the face or kind word from a stranger makes it all better. when we have problems we are to pray to him and stop worrying about it. You need to ask him what path you should be on and eventually we all get there. Knowing that I will have no problems at the end of my life is wonderful. Most people who believed in God and stopped because they would say what kind of God would allow these terrible things to happen. Its not God...What doesn't kill you makes you stronger...Hardship breeds character..and knowing that He never gives me more than I can handle.

I used to work graveyard. I had to adjust from being a morning to a night person and then vice versa after I dropped that job. . . What I did, is I forced myself to get up early and I did things to keep myself busy so I wouldn't take a nap and then I started to set a pattern of going to bed earlier at night. It might take a while, but you will adjust

It's a hard thing to deal with. I have Horrid panic attacks just driving....Me I am on medication but I am bi-polar2 and the panic and anxiety disorder comes with it......If you feel the need to talk to some one do it. That is the beginning of help....There are groups for people with anxiety/panic disorder it is hard at first but after you go and hear others talk about how they feel and have felt it really makes you feel better that your not the only one.You can get some ideas how they handle things. Call mental health in your area they can help also not only for that but the depression...I go to mental health they are friendly and understanding.  deep breathing and .yoga can help For me I try to stay away from the situation if I can.... You didn't get this way over night it won't go away over night.........It'll get better

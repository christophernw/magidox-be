Alot are still waiting on a place to live (ie, tons of trailers just sitting there unused)that officials haven't got the nerve to bypass red tape and just give them to the people. And all the displaced people also haven't got the ability to vote in the next Louisiana elections which will continue despite the fact they aren't there. It has ceased to be of interest to the news channels so we don't hear anything about it anymore. If they were rich people, this would have never turned out this way.

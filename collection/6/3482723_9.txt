it doesnt matter how many tickets you get.. it just matters when you check into your flight.. you can check into your flight 24 hours before boarding time. Normally, like on southwest (im not sure what other airlines do this), you are able to check in online and print your boarding pass out. Even if you do not have a printer, all you need is the internet, your name and confirmation number, and you check in. It;ll then show your boarding pass with what section you have, which will most likely be boarding group A.  If you do not want to print your boarding pass you dont have to, but when you get to the airport just go to the check in counter and inform them that you have already checked in but you lost your boarding pass (or just simply need one). They will print you out another boarding pass with the same boarding group that would have been on the one you printed out.

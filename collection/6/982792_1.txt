I believe everyone should respect other's rights to choose.. regardless of whether it conflicts with their own... personally I would love my child unconditionally. I am a Christian... some people say they are Christian but don't really  understand what that means... if you have the love of Christ in you.. you love unconditionally. I am no better than anyone else.. I try not to judge cus I am not in their shoes. Don't decide based on just a few opinions out of millions :)

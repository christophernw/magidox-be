Scientifically proven to be what or do what.  How did science prove that what he wrote was the truth???  How do YOU scientifially prove that it should be in the Bible.  You MIGHT prove that Judas wrote it, but I doubt that.  You could prove that it was written in that time period.  Why does that mean it should be part of the Bible.  If Jack the Ripper wrote a book should we include it also??  Judas, a known thief and liar and traitor wrote a book, SO WHAT?  Bill Clinton wrote a book too.  Big Deal.

I am an applied linguistics professor in Japan and was once perplexed by the same question many years ago when I first came here.. . It is for a couple of reasons. When the Japanese syllabary is put into Roman leters (our A,B,Cs), they use only the letter R. It is misleading because the sound they make is neither an R or an L sound. It is someplace in between the two. Adjoining sounds often alter the sound in some ways making it seem more R than L at times and vice versa. . . The best way to think of it is to think of it as a separate sound all together.. . Good luck! Ganbate!

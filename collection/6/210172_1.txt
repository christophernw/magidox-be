The ultimate balance of the chakras is found in our eternal being or existence.  We are all minute expansions of the Supreme Soul.  Our ultimate origin is eternal and our real self is eternal.  Due to limitations on the eternal plane of existence we have wound up in this material existence.  In this material existence we are trapped in a temporal bodily tabernacle that is subject to birth, death, old age, disease and other miseries.  We percieve these miseries as miseries due to our mistaken perception of things.  This gets back to our eternal limitations.  This temporal bodily tabernacle encounters problems such as the alignment of the cakras.   . . It is ultimately due to misperception that our chakras are out of line.  There are some basic processes to correct our perception of things.  Generally, these two processes are know as Dharma and Yoga.  Through correct practice of Dharma we advance to Yoga.  Through correct practice of Yoga we advance to complete enlightenment or self-realization.  This complete self-realization means fully realizing one's eternal self, one's eternal identity.  . . There are different types of Dharma, but generally Varnasrama Dharma is the most ideal.  Varnasrama Dharma is based on social order organized according to natural concerns such as the modes of nature "Guna".  Varnasraama Dharma culminates in Sanatana Dharma or our eternal "business", "duty", "responsibility" (However you wish to translate Dharma).  . . There are various types of Yoga, but ultimately the highest Yoga is Bhakti Yoga.

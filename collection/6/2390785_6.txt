Well it's like this I think that it's because they have the oldest suriving mornachary still in existance and it gives them a great deal of pride and also the engilsh language did orignate there hench the term " The Queens English" when being asked to speak properly plus their accent also sounds to Americans to be affluent and snobish like they are better then... so to speak.  It's not that they're snobby it's that they are raised to have a certian bit of decorum about them and they would never think of doing things that we as Americans wouldn't give it another thought.  They are raised in a more victorian type fashion that we as Americans still may perceive as being under english rule, but those are my thoughts on the matter.

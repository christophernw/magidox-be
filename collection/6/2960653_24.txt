Get your facts straight. First, Christmas is not about the birth of Jesus, or Christ, or whatever you want to call him. The bible (your bible) clearly states that at the time of the little Bubba’s birth, the shepherds were tending their flocks in the hills – that would be their spring/summer feeding area. If you take your sheep to the upper fields in winter, they only get snowballs and cold dirt to eat.. . So, you cannot even get the timing of the birth of your Bubba-Jesus correct. Second, people were celebrating the winter solstice long before there were any Christians. . . So, in summary, your holiday is based on a lie and the theft of a non-Christian celebration of nature’s rebirth and renewal. And, let us not forget the underlying truth that everything you believe is imaginary and make-believe. That would seem to make Christmas a holiday for the Not-Honest and the Not-Sane. Yeah, I guess you are right after all…it is a celebration of Christianity.

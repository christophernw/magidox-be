As with almost all, you have made a generalization that is incorrect and frankly, an insult.. . There are plenty of "white people and people of all ethnic groups who either work in the hot sun or are willing to do so, but here in the United States, it is not working in the hot sun, but rather it is working picking crops for companies that refuse to pay decent, survivable wages.. . As long as these companies can get away with keeping wages super low and continue to attract illegals to work, they will continue. In their mind, "why pay someone livable wages when you can get cheap (almost slave) labor to do it and keep the profits high."

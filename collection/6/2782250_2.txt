A company with lifting requirements is not discriminating, they are being honest about what it takes to do the job they need done.  In turn, you should be honest about your abilities.  You may have to rethink the type of work you are willing to do.  There are a great many jobs available that do not require lifting.  If you have no training in anything else, visit your local community college and take some classes in another field.  They often have scholarships and payment plans for students who must work and go to school at the same time.  If you lie and are hired and then hurt yourself because of a pre-existing condition you hid, you may jeopardize any workman's comp benefits.

Depending on what you're looking for. If you're under 30 and what to hang out and watch college football or baseball on a Saturday afternoon, drink beer, eat some chicken wings and maybe play beer pong; Down the Hatch is really good. It's in the village on West 4th between 6th and 7th. They have a special on Saturday afternoon from 1-6, it's $19 pp and you get three pitchers of beer and all you can eat wings.

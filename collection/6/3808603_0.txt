Electrolytes are taken into the body through the foods that we eat, they aren't made by the body.  Electolytes are important because cells can manage the amount of water in the cells by moving the electolytes inside and outside the cells (the water molecules follow the electrolytes).  The main ones needed by the body are sodium, potassium, and chloride.

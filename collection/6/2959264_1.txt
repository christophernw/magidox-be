I think it's because it actually does get warmer. The phase transition from liquid to solid is accompanied by a decrease in energy, and since energy is conserved, the energy lost is going toward warming the air.. . Remember that ice is not necessarily colder than water. If you freeze water, the temerature is constant as you freeze it--only after it is frozen does its temperature decrease further. (Likewise, ice doesn't get hotter while it's melting, which is why you can keep a beverage cool by putting ice in it.)

When they're young it's hard to tell. I once got 2 hamsters in which I was told (by a dude at the pet store) were females. I named them Holly and Peanut. Well, later on I found out Peanut had peanuts... -coughcough- And that was on Thanksgiving Day. As they get older you can REALLY tell if they are or aren't female. Can't really remember when they were babies how they looked, but best of luck with that.

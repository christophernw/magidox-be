Justgenius is right. The College Board sends the schools the list of applicants whose tests  were misgraded. But, unfortunately, according to one admissions officer, that will factor very little in the outcome of their admission decisions. But, they are irritated by the way the College Board has released information. One admissions officer called it " drip by drip". Also, it should also be noted that the school that admissions officer was from, Pomona College in California, said that at his school  only 12 applicants had their SATs  misgraded. Also in proportion to the millions of people that took the SAT, only a few thousand SATs were misgraded. That is not bad considering the College Board will send the schools the list of applicants who SAT were misgraded..   But, I believe the College Board has a lot of liability in the SAT screw-up, but they are taking the appropriate measures..  But, personally, I hope the applicants get in to the schools that they want.

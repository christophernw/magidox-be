A 'shrew' was a common (fairly mild) insult at the time.  It was used to characterise a woman who was 'difficult', had a mind of her own and would not submit to the 'natural authority' of men (typically her husband or father).. . The motivation for the phrase might have come from the fact that shrews are known to be energetic and aggresive animals. (I'm speculating o this last one).

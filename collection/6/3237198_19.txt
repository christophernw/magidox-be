Petsmart DOES NOT sell cats or dogs.  They provide space in their store for local animal shelters to bring in cats and dogs (on selected days) that are available for adoption.  They have saved over 1 million lives.  (almost 2, I believe).  The great pet stores do not sell dogs or cats.  Some don't even sell rabbits or ferrets because there are too many wonderful animals that need to be adopted.  Petland, which is a fairly popular pet store gets their animals from puppy mills.  They are not breed to the correct standards and the places where the come from are in horrible shape.  The moms are kept in cages way to small and they aren't even clean.  HBO had a documentary with an undercover guy from an animal shelter get a job at one of these and he recorded all that went on there and presented to the proper authorities.  The place got shut down but there are still many out there.  I respect pet stores that choose not to sell cats or dogs.  Although puppies are cute to look at in pet stores, when I see them I have a hard time not picturing their mommy some where in a cage, un-healthy, and without human contact or companionship.

First, Spartan is NOT the best.. . Check out the FAR's, first of all.  A&P's are certificated under 14 CFR 65.. . The FAA has a page on becoming a mechanic.. . Basically, it takes up to 30 months to do on the job or however long to do it through a 147 mechanic school.  Do you have a degree?  If not, I would highly suggest you find a university that offers a degree AND an A&P, otherwise you'll be stuck wrenching for the rest of your life.

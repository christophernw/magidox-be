how many days were you in the military before they booted you out? i was in the military for 23 years and they always funded the military pretty god until richard nixon got in then it went to hell and that is for a fact. i think if i were you i would retract this question. remember you go to war with what you have not what you want to have??????? the famous saying of dumsfield.

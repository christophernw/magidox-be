If you're feeling guilty, then some part of your heart or mind is not quite ready.. . One of the laws Jesus gave us was to love God with our whole heart and soul and strength.  If there's any guilt there, then you're not giving yourself over to God.. . Yes, you might go through a tough time with conversion as you'll have to defend your beliefs to those who are concerned about you.. . And I don't know how Hindhu's can believe in Jesus...believe that he existed?  Or follow his teachings?  That I'm not sure of...perhaps you're making a compromise, and that God would not accept either, I don't think.. . So reexamine your heart and seriously think about making the conversion.  I'm not saying 'don't do it' cause it's your life.  But I'm suggesting, from experience, that you really really make sure that this is the right thing to do.  There can't be any guilt or doubt...but there will be hard times, and you must soldier on because it's what you believe in.

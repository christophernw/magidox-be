There could be life elsewhere in the universe. It's quite likely. However, for life to exist on a planet the conditions on the planet must be hospitable to life.  To name a few: the orbit must be near circular so the temperature of the planet doesn't vary that greatly, water must exist, it can't be burning hot, etc. These are pretty good assumptions but only what we are guessing is required to support life.. . Adaptation is different than the creation of life or evolution of life. Adaptation assumes that there already is life.  Through natural selection, the species (not the actual animal) gradually adapts to it's environment.. . It may interest you to know the following:  All lunar probes, mars explorer robots etc. are decontaminated before they are sent to the planet.  The reason? At this time we don't want any bacteria or other earth organisms hitchhiking their way to mars where they might "adapt" and begin to thrive.  Anything that comes back to earth is treated in the same manner - we wouldn't want a "martian" bacteria living here on earth!

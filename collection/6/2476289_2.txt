"Addiction" is a very powerful word, as addiction is a very powerful thing.  I believe if someone is "addicted" to video games, the problem isn't the video games themselves, the problem is in the reason for someone becoming addicted (to anything) in the first place.  People who like to play video games aren't addicted simply because they don't want to stop playing.  . . Someone who is "addicted" to video games most likely has other addictions as well which are probably more of a threat to him/herself.  Anyone with addiction problems should seek treatment from a doctor, or help from family, friends, and support groups.

It's nice that you are getting a kitten, but don't you still care about the older cat?  That one to two years should have formed some kind of bond.  If you only want kittens, then why not take the unwanted cat to the shelter? How welcome do you think she is going to make that kitten, when she gets her butt scooted out the door to make room for the baby?. . Cats, who go outside, get fleas, ear mites, wounds and infections from fighting with other cats, hit by cars, abused by nasty people, and are exposed to everything from antifreeze on the street to poison baited food.  I think you could let them share a litter box or spend a few dollars to buy an additional one.. . I have ten cats.  Everyone of them was someone's cat at one time, but they weren't cute anymore, had the nerve to get pregnant, or start spraying and were dumped out on the street.  That is how I got them, complete with all sorts of medical problems that came from life on the streets.  They are well now, thank heavens.

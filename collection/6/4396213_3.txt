The real reason for any inequality issues in religion is that religions are fictitious beliefs/ideas made up by men, and when these beliefs didn't fit a certain persons ideal faith, new ones were made, as is the case with the Latter Day Saints movement and Joesph Smith. Mormonism is just an extreme fundamentalist play off of Christianity. If religion is anything, it is not fair and just.

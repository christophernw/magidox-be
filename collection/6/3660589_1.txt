Try blowing in her face.  (They HATE that.). Mama-cats will "cuff" their little ones when they play too rough, so if you pop her on the head (not to hard, of course) whenever she does it, she'll probably learn quickly.  Also say "NO' loudly, and then put her off the bed and onto the floor..   My 8 month old kitten (no longer kitten size) does the same thing by biting me on the nose -- not hard, just enough to make me wake up and pay attention to her.

First... define what you think is skinny.  How much do you want to lose?. . Eat healthy nutritious foods... drink ONLY water and lots of it... cut sugar (including high-fructose corn syrup) completely out of your diet, and be sure to exercise - especially aerobics.. . If you don't eat, then your body will go into starvation mode, and then when you DO eat, it will store everything you eat as fat (because it's expecting to not get food for a while)  You might also start binge eating, which would pack on more pounds than you lost.  . . Just eat healthy and exercise and you'll be fine.

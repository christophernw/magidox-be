I don't know what you believe it's going to happen to you after you die? By your fear I can see you're not sure about it. Well I believe there is a Heaven and a Hell, and that God gave us life with a purpose not just to awake in the mourning and going to sleep at night, there is more.Like I told you before, I don't know what you believe but I believe there is a God that gave the life of His only son just to give us eternal life, all we have to do is accept Jesus as our only savior and let Him enter our harts and change our lives. After that I'll guarantee your fears are going to disappear and you will start to see death as the beginning of an eternal life in Jesus , that is if you fully trust Him.

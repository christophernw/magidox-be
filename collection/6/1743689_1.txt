With unemployment claims going down that is first sign that people are working! Tax breaks hmm lets see people who work pay taxes the rich pay more because they make more its grammar school math. Who owns the buisnesses that hire? The Rich!! By giving tax breaks to them they can increase profit and hire more people again grammar school math. Companies close down because they cant afford to stay open in US! Giving Tax breaks allows businesses to stay here! Who is responsible for economy? Thats a LONG story but its NOT Bush! I have had this very dicussion with a economics Professor from a local College. First a lesson in Civics. . No one man runs this country!! We have a Senate, House or Representives, Congress etc etc. All who play MAJOR roles in the running of our country! No one man makes these decsions! Want to blame then blame them all!!! Not just Bush. . Next: I want you all (who know how to budget your household) to pay atention! This is how Professor presented this to me. You make changes in your family budget (any change) and its takes anywhere from one month to three months to make an impact on your budget and 3 -6 months for long term impact! Now multiply that by 280 million (approx population of US). It would take anywhere from 3 - 7 YEARS to impact the US economy and 5 - 8 years for any long term impact!! This from a College Professor in economics! A registered democrat at that!. . This means that the great economy we enjoyed during Clinton years were largely teh result of Reganomics! It also means the first term of Bush and poor economy was rsult of clinton years and the upswing we now are beginning to see is Bush's doing!. . The President says the economy is better because it is!

I honestly believe that God did provide everything in the way of food and medicine for man to enjoy however, because of the fall, we do not look upon many things that He gave as "good'.  I believe that the marijuana plant was probably used for medicinal purposes; research Native Americans and others who used plants for healing, etc.however, man's greed has changed the way we see the good that God provided. Our misuse of his gifts and the combination of products have hurt many people.

You might have mold in your shower. Or you have a fragrance in one of your shampoos or soaps. Or you take cold showers. Generally heat and humidity don't *cause* asthma - that'd be an unusual response. Regardless, talk to your doctor.. . (I've also had trouble when I've hyperventilated in the shower and got lightheaded. Guess what I was doing?)

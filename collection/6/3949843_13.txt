It has nothing to do with God or Satan. It boils down to one fact.  We are animals with animal instincts. No matter how enlightened we feel, we cannot completely rid ourselves of the need to be leader of the pack. The big problem is not everyone can be the leader, so throughout history, some human beings fight for supremecy while other human beings suffer the consequences of war.  It would be nice if we could get past this and truly care about each other.  Maybe someday, our race will evolve enough to have such a capacity for love and compassion, but I fear we will destroy ourselves first.

You take it one step at a time...there is nothing glamorous nor that terribly exciting about adult life...just bills, bills & more bills!!! j/k--there are some perks to adult life (ie no curfew, can buy liquor legally, etc) but they also come with responsibilities!! It makes me wonder somedays why I was in such a gosh darn hurry to grow up!!!! . . But in the long run, you will be fine, just take one day at a time & you'll find that it really IS as hard as it looks/sounds!!! =) Good luck!!!

Well, emo is a form of emotional punk. Really, that's more like the band AFI than it is Green Day. While GD's new stuff (and Good Riddance)is kinda emo, they're not for the most part. The people who call GD 'emo' probaly don't care for them, as 'emo' is often an insult for a band that isn't emo. Another emo (technically emo-pop) band is All-American Rejects, if you want a more popular example than AFI. Another definition of emo is just someone who's overly emotional. It's basically another way of saying sappy.

I have been to worship in churches where in the middle of it all some people felt compelled to take off their shoes because of the presence of God.  Because of cultural differences and also I believe in levels of faith this is the case.  Each church has it's own "culture" and will show it's respect or reverence or fear in different ways, Americans will not take their shoes off unless they are told (normally)  Maybe because we are self conscious about odors or our shoes are so comfy here.

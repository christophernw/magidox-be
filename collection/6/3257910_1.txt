You said, "There's only 2 people who know my password myself & my boyfriend.". . Why would you give anyone your password?  Three other people had it -- your boyfriend and 2 others.  However, they could have given it to someone..... . Keep all passwords to yourself.  Then, you will know for certain who has them.

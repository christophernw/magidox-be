i guess within their own group they are okay with using the *n* word but when other people use it, it crosses the line. like when you call your friends stupid things you are okay with it because they are your friends but when someone you don't know calls your friends something stupid you get mad...i don't know if i am phrasing this right... like i am asian so with my asian friends i make stupid and mean jokes about asians, but when other white people make stupid and mean asian jokes i don't like it.

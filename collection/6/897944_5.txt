A choir is in church.  The choir people are church-goers, so a preacher "preaching to the choir" means that you are telling something to someone that already agrees with your views.  The choir believes the preacher already, or else they would not be in church, in the choir.  Your friend is saying you're telling her things she already knows because she likes them too ...well, except bad-mouthing the lead singer.

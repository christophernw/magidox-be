While i agree with droptoptommy. there are places that already have pressure splitters that might be willing to cut it for you.. sometimes for free if they arnt  busy and its no trouble.. . Other then that, the circular saw is about the best bet, as it cuts the straightest line and removes the least amount of material from the stone.

There is a social stigma about smoking marijuana because it is  an addictive drug that has no value whatsoever. It may make you "feel good" but that is just temporary.This is what causes the addiction. It is a psychological addiction caused by the need to make oneself feel better. This and the fact that it is more dangerous than tobacco is the reason for a social stigma. Marijuana may have 50% less toxins than tobbaco, but pot smokers hold the smoke in their lungs 4 to 5 times longer in order to absorb the chemical that causes a euphoric feeling in the user.

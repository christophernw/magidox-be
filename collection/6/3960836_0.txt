Hi there...  generally, all cats in the commercials and film industry have been formerly trained by an animal trainer as they have to understand commands such as sit, weave, sit up, wave, freeze and capable of focusing to learn both visual and vocal commands as well as handle very strange environments  since the sets are noisy and busy with a lot of action that many cats would otherwise find stressful.  If kitty can handle this then your kitty would require an animal talent agency representing them.  The agency then would make the arrangements for placing your kitty in commercials.

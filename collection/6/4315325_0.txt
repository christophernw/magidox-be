Hurricanes are named so they can be documented for history, almanac, etc.  Things like the strength of the wind, the destruction it caused, etc are linked to the name of the storm.   Without a name, everybody will go around saying, "remember back in February of 2006 when that big storm hit?"   Blah!   That don't sound right.

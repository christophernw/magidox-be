You can't really. I work in a static control enviroment we use a stap that goes around our shoes this ground us from being shocked. If you search online you can find one. Also there is a spray that you can spray on fabics to help control the static but it does have to be reapplied from time to time. As one person said before you can also use another part of your body that is less sensative. I use my elbow most of the time. You will find that as it starts to warm up the static will become less.

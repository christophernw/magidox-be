I'd say be true to yourself and know what's best for you, if you think Hinduism is better then be a good one which means you can't believe in Jesus, there will be guilt yes I know but your faith must be much stronger than your guilt in order for you to follow your religion. My guess is that you are adapted with the Hindu customs of praying and rituals and stuff but of course you can't be believeing in Jesus if you also believe in reincarnation and all.. Lastly, it's not the religion that determine whether you goto heaven or not nor good deeds but it's your own belief. . . And as I Christian, I do not want to judge you but better of keep your faith in Jesus. Good Luck! God Bless

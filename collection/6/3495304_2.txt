let your endocrinologist know that you are interested in finding out about other people with the condition in your living area. most places have diabetic camp, groups, annual fund raising, annual get together trips etc..... your Dr. should know of all of these activities. my son has been diabetic since he was 16 months old and he is currently 12 years old. if you would like to email me with your experiences i would be glad to accommodate.

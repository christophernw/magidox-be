A car cylinder in an engine is a metal tube inside which a piston moves up and down powered by an explosive mixture such as petrol vapor and air ignited by an electric spark. This makes the crankshaft rotate and ultimately causes the wheels to turn.. . More cylinders allows for a more even spacing of the explosions, so an engine with more cylinders usually runs more smoothly.

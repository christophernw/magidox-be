Because it's easy to do... And you have to admit, both sides are guilty of this.  How many times have we seen certain Muslims complain about Americans, yet call them all Christians and say "How Christ-Like", yet really have no idea how many of the Christians interpret their own religion.  . This is one battle neither side is going to win and the battle will never end, because no one has the nerve to actually say "we could be wrong".

Why do you want to be a janitor? Is this a life goal? My first guess would be going to the classifieds and looking under janitor. If you need experience go to the local hospital and volunteerr to clean up vomit and offal from the floors. Once you have that figured out you can go with pride (?) to your next job interview and say, "YES I am a Janitor and I Want This job!! And I DEMAND you pay me less than 13k a year". I hope I have helped you relize this dream

Did you know that in the 50s, Iran had a leader called Mossedegh?  He was a wonderful and popular man who only cared about the welfare and freedoms of his people.  He had this wild and crazy notion, that if Iran could actually OWN the oil that was pumping out of its oil wells, then it could pay for more schools, health care, social services.  He actually made Time/Life's man of the year twice.. . Unfortunately, for Mossedegh, the oil wells were owned by Great Britain.  So Britain sent an envoy to the US to beg for help.  The US responded with Roosevelt's grandson.  He went over with several secret service from Great Britain, and caused a revolution.  A sheik took over and things went okay, as long as he did what Great Britain wanted him to do.  And then there was another revolution, and the Ayatollah took over.  Now, nobody has any say over Iran, and it is all the CIA's fault.. . They have planned similar deeds in Cuba, Columbia (that was a real brain freeze), Chili, and Venezuela.  I'm thinking that they should be put out of business FAST.

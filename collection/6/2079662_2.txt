Eclipses are relatively rare, but they occur when either the Moon blocks your view of the Sun, or the Earth blocks the Sun from reflecting from the Moon.  Since the Earth's and Moon's orbits are not coplanar, most months go by with no eclipse at all.. . What's amazing is that the Moon and th Sun are so close in angular subtense that makes the Moon such a greater solar eclipser.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon  angular size 29' to 33'. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun angular size ~32'. . . True eclipses need both objects to have similar angular subtense to make it a real eclipse.  . . Otherwise, one can consider the Moon to "eclipse"all the stars that are hidden behind it.  Likewise, when Mercury or Venus are in front of the Sun, we'd all it an eclipse instead of a transit.

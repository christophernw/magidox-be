You don't own a cat.  A cat decides to hang out with you.  In some cases, a cat decides to be your friend and sometimes they are just freeloaders.  It's like they say, if you love someone, set them free.  A cat that doesn't like you won't come back.  Right now I'm in an apartment with a "no pets" rule.  :(

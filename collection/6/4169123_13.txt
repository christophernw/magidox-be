trust me friend, if you have a dog that you love, i mean really love,and it is non-aggresive, then do your absolute best to keep it that way. seriously, i have been in that spot and i ruined a most wonderful dog and relationship by imposing my agressive will upon the only true friend in my life. i ask you, do you find it okay for another to force change in yourself? if your companion is too docile for your personality then, please, forward it to a person that enjoys the laid back "nice" type and then look to rescue the aggressive type from your local adoption center. believe me when i say that turning a sweet dog sour would be in your worst interests, karmatically speaking.

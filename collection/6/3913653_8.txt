It takes a strong sense of will power to overcome the urges we have for one another. if your desires are met then you can easily overcome them assuming you have a partner(s) who can satisfy this desire.. . My suggestion would either be to find a project or something that keeps your mind occupied or to find someome capbale of giving you what you need. I hope this helps and good luck.

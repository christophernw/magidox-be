Happens to me all the time. It's better if you can request a seat as close to the front of the plane as possible, seems that when I'm in the tail-section it got worse. It depends on where it's landing too, the rate of decent and all.. . Sitting near the windows seem to help too, not sure if the pressure somehow accumilated in the middle but when I had a seat there, it was also the first time it hurt so much I cried. . . Chewing gum definately helped me, sucking on candy or drinking something, basically swallowing stuff helped when pinching the nose and blowing couldn't (and doesn't) help. . . There was another time I actually tilted my head and somehow managed to pop my ear a little, releasing a bit of the pressure. Try massaging behind your ears too. . . You should get your ears checked. I didn't know why one of my ears were affected so badly until my doc told me that I had a crooked ear canal. . . And always make sure you clean your ears before flying. Just like diving, dirty ears will hurt. . . Enjoy your next trip :D

webjnke1, is right.  the phrase 'running around like a chicken with your head cut off' is just a phrase.  It's been known for a human body to still 'react' in that way after the head has been severed.  Or worse yet.. not completely severed.  The chicken will jump and flop around, but that's just the enegry built up in the musles letting loose all at once because there's no longer any control over them.

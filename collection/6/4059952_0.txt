After calling your vet FIRST, and making sure that this would be okay for your dog and there's no blockage from chewing rawhide or anything in his intestines, maybe feed him about half a can of pure pumpkin (NOT PUMPKIN PIE MIX).  THis is a good food to "get things moving".  A little bit of liquid laxative (like one tablespoon) might work too, but make sure you have a back yard where he can stay for a while with plenty of water because he/she probably won't hold it in the house.

I think as many stated above it likely has to do with the impatiance of many diners (apparently mostly in America) and the desire to appease them with something while they wait for there main meal to be prepared.. . The trend spread and now it is just customary....or at least in the majority of the mainstream restaurants--Old habits die hard...could you imagine if they tried switching back to serving it towards the end...diners would be like where the heck is my salad, it would consume the dinner conversation.  I personally enjoy munching on my salad as I eat my main course...

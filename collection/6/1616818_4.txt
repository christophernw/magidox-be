Who would want to eat peanut butter that has a layer of fat on the surface?. I guess they made it in the way that it is homogeneous so the components don't separate out.. I think what they mean by natural is that they used real peanut. And they don't add extra fat/oil. Of course oil from peanuts don't separate out unless you heat it.

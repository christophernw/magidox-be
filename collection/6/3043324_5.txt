by showing them the effects of not being a safe driver. When i was younger a woman that used to live in our neighborhood lost both her daughter and son in two different car accidents and that kind of made me and my friends try not to be bad drivers when we grew up. That was the way we used to think when we were kids, but the impact was so hard that we all try to avoid things like drinking and driving.. . good luck.

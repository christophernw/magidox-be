First of all not everyone 'hates' jews, just like not everyone hates blacks, asians, incas, aboriginals and so on... I believe that, throughout history, the Jewish people have been very opportunistic, but more importantly, they've been able to transform these opportunities into concrete and beneficial outcomes, sometimes even by morally questionable means... A reason for this good fortune might be because of their nomadic nature, which started over 2000 years ago; the more people travel, the more chances, or hazards, they will encounter.. . I also believe that the reason for anti-semitism is due to simple & pure jealousy, just like you get jealous when your neighbour pulls up in his driveway in a brand-new Ferrari or Porshe... . A typical human thought would be; "That's not fair! I work harder than him and I'm only driving a five-year old Toyota..." . . Hitler gave full way to his personal hatred against Jews by unleashing his army against them throughout most of developed Europe. What helped him a lot in his macabre enterprise, was that a lot of Europeans had already cultivated some sort of repugnance for their apparently more-successful neighbours, the Jews. . . On a final note, the Egyptians and the Romans did as the Nazi leader did, only they did it in the Middle East. And let's not forget the British, Spanish and Portuguese who massacred thousands of Incas in America in order to (re)build the 'free world'.. . Success is almost always associated with controversy.

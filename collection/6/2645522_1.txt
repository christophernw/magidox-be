It is ironic. But Cain killed, and God didn't stop him. He could have made usrobots subject only to his will. But he decided to let us do what we will, even breaking his laws.. . But it's a test of who's worthy to live forever. The children are harmed; but even it messes up their entire lives, it will mean nothing after a thousand years of eternal life. The priest is to be pitied. He devoted his life to God, then yielded to Satan. His eternal goal may be gone.

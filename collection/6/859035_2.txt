There is no way to find out if a person has been deported if you are a regular citizen.  This information is easily available to law enforcement agencies though.  If you think a person may be an illegal immigrant, you can call the DHS or ICE tip line or call your local ICE or Border Patrol office.  And yes, there are Border Patrol offices throughout the US, not just at the northern and southern borders.

I heard non-christians use the phrase,The Christ within;our higher selves,higher conciousness,anointed.A man can be a christ.Some people think that Jesus'name was Jesus Christ,but it was Jesus the Christ.. . There are so many churches because people segregate themselves according to their beliefs.People interpret the bible differently and some follow scriptures that ohers don't. For example,Johovah's witness' don't believe in celebrating holidays.It said somewhere in the bible it was prohibited.Also,there are just alot of ministers who desired to preach and started their own church.People who enjoy their message,join their church.

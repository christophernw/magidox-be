-Don't belive in anything they tell you without questioning (make your own mind). -Don't do anything just because you have to(do what you like). -Don't hurt others for personal gain and don't let others hurt you for theit personal gain(have your own space, neither more nor less). -Plan as if you'll live forever, enjoy as if you'd die tommorow :)

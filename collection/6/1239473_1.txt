Mothballs repel snakes.  Be acreful if you have an animal though because they may eat them (which is not good). You could put them in a baby food jar and cut slits in the lid ...then put them in different locations around the outside of your house.  Lowe's sells snake repellant which is crushed up mothbalss...but it is cheaper to just buy mothballs and do it yourself.

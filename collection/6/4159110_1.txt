Durkheim provided a statistical analysis of suicide which he of  fit into 4 categories. I can see the point of your question as he didn't exactly give us an UNDERSTANDING of suicide but more the interpretation of coroner's reports, death certificates and basically statistical data. Maybe then, that's part of your answer - Durheim isn't really an understanding but an interpretation. Can't remember what Douglas and Atkinson said........but comparing, contrasting and at the end of it summarising the question ......did any of these guys give an actural understanding which would be an interpretist method.

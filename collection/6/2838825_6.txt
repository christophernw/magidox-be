The Bible is indeed the Word of God, written by men of God, and protected by God so it was not changed. God is powerful enough to do that, and anyone who doubts that, is trying to limit the power of God.. . There are no contradictions, those who do not have God's Holy Spirit in them, can't see the whole Truth of God's Word. When we accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior, God sends His Holy Spirit to live within us to guide us and show us His Truths.. . God called homosexuality an abomination, it was not one of the 10 Commandments. But it is a sinful lifestyle choice. God does not make people homosexual, they choose that lifestyle because they lust for people of the same sex.

you have to start at the bottom and work your way up, my advice is do what i did, get a 9 to 5 job and save as much as you can, when you have saved 1500 or more, invest in stocks bonds and roth ira's, trust me, only purchace blue chip stocks, you wont be sorry, find a broker neer you to help you get started, i use edward jones investments ive been with them since i was 16 and am worth 1.2 million if i sell right now i am now 27

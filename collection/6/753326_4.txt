I'm having flash backs to my molecular biology class... which was a cool class. The other reason why RNA is less stable than DNA is that RNA has an oxygen group which makes it highly vunerable to chemical attacks by enzymes mentioned above. DNA doesn't... hence the name "De-oxy".. . I'm starting med school at UCLA this Fall. Yay!!!

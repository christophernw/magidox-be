The mestizo population (spanish and indigenous background) is about 70% of Mexican population. No, you can't be so simplistic to say that the origin of mestizo population was indian women beeing raped. Some was raped, the majority was a result of normal marriage. Sounds like you think all Mexicans are from one race. 20% of Mexicans are still indegenous and 10%are still white, although the indigenous and the whites do have a bit of the opposite race in their blood. And no, mestizos are not considered a "new race", they are simply people that is a result of the mixage of more than one race.. . And Mexico is not in South America, Mexico is in North America.

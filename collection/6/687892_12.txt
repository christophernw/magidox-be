The saying you've quoted-- "all that glitters is gold"-- is a line from "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin.  Here it is:. . "There's a lady who's sure/all that glitters is gold/and she's buying the stairway to heaven.". . Apparently, Robert Plant is playing with/inverting the actual proverb, which so many people have already pointed out is "all that glitters is not gold.". . What could he mean?  Well, that's open to interpretation (it is a song, after all) but it seems that he's negating the proverb to show how foolish the character in this song is.  She thinks pretty things are valuable, and she has a lot of money, so she's buying the stairway to heaven, which may make things difficult for a lot of people.. . Hope that helps.

That is personal preference.. I have bright blue eyes and always think those really dark black looking eyes are beautiful.. I have also loved hazel eyes, brown eyes, only twice blue eyes, and once knew a guy with the most amazing SILVER eyes.. I would have to say that although he was not the prettiest guy I ever saw, his eye color, that silver color that I have never seen on anyone else, was the most beautiful.. I also knew a guy with actual GOLD eyes which were nice.

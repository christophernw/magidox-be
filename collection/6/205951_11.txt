Well it all goes back to the "good ole days". I am black and I recently went out with my friend (who is white) and alot of black guys and girls were looking at us, but who cares. I thought about what other people may say and the looks we were getting but I also knew how I felt. I was out to have a good time with a friend and that's what we did. The people around didn't even exist to us. Let them look on for all I care. It makes me feel kinda good when people talk and look at me because that makes me realize that they have nothing better to do with there time besides have me on their mind. That means I have been the center of their attention and so be it. Makes me feel real important. It all boils down to their ignorance and lack of having any business of their own. I think that black and white woman get mad if a woman of the other race happens to nab a man of their race who is successful or doing something with themselves. I've heard that alot, but nobody would care if Becky was dating broke a$$ Mike or Keisha was with hillbilly Bob. So it's a two way street. I guess your cousin has learned that the stares and comments are part of the territory and has learned to take it in stride. Or else she is so smitten with her guy she doesn't care what anybody else thinks, and good for her. Ultimately it comes down to black peoples oppression by whites  for so many years and some get a little hot under the collar because they feel the black in the relationship is a traitor to their race and is "sleeping with the enemy". It's all a bunch of bologna. It's a new day and time and people are free to pick and choose to be with whomever they want, it's a free country, right? It's not just black and white. Their are all kinds of prejudices people have against other  of different races, genders, and sexual orientation to name a few. It's the way of the world we live in. We just have to live in it and make the most of it. All the best.

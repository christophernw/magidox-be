Just send the kids with them.  And while we are at it, it's time to get rid of the whole naturalized citizen thing because it's being abused all to hell.  We have thousands of pregnant women roaming around in the dangerous desert in the hopes that they will get to the US before their baby is born so it will have US citizenship and hopefully they will be able to stay here.  That's extreme child abuse and a heinous thing to do but thousands and thousands do it every year because of our misguided policy.

JK doesn't even know what the title will officially be yet. So therefore the public doesn't know. She's not even releasing any details on the book besides the fact that more characters will die in it. Here's her web site, some pretty interesting facts here :D. Includes interviews she's done and what little info she does give out about the next book.

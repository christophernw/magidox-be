Is this bill due to a hospital? If so, I would check with the hospitals business office about their patient assistance program. Most hospitals have a program that will assist the patient with their bills based on income. If you qualify, they could forgive your debt up to 100%. If you do not qualify, set up a pymt arrangement in writing with that office. Usually if you show an attempt at paying the bill, they will accept the arrangements rather than incur more costs by going to court. Good luck with this.

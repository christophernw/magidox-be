Uh...well for one most everything you do at the holidays....like decorating a tree, giving gifts, lighting candles, wreaths, stockings, Santa, red and green...etc are all PAGAN in origin. Maybe you guys should stop celebrating your saviors birth in this manner. Maybe you could go to stables, sit in the hay and eat unleavened bread or something. Oh no, the pagan things that you co-opted are much more fun aren't they? . . Why don't you stop trying to shove your version of X-mas on everyone and make your own savior the focus of YOUR holiday.

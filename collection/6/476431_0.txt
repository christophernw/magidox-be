The pigments belong to a group of chemicals called flavonoids.. Plants make all the things they need from carbon dioxide in the air and water from the soil (this is photosynthesis) plus minerals (e.g. nitrates, sulphates, phosphates, etc.)from the soil.. The pigment you mention and any other colour you see in plants is made by the plant.. Plants make themselves.

Part of the answer lies in what some people have said here - that the satellite is actually "falling" all the time.  This is because velocity is a vector.  That means that it has not only speed, but direction too.  A change in either component - speed or direction - leads to acceleration, in this case what is known as radial acceleration. Since the satellite is constantly moving in toward the center of the earth instead of flying off in a straight line, it is said to be falling, or accelerating toward the center.  If you balance the pull of gravity perfectly so that the force only bends the path but does not pull the satellite in, you have an orbit. If you arrange it so that the satellite does not move in reference to a fixed point on the surface of the planet, you have a geosynchronous orbit.. . However, the reality is that the orbits of all man-made satellites do eventually decay, and they all crash down sooner or later - usually on a period of 50 years or so.

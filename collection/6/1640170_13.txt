Well personally I am not religous, (rather spiritual) but if you look at revalations this perdicament is going to come to a head. The united states is going to be the one to force it. Then there will supposedly be a stretch of peace before the proverbial s*^t hits the fan for good. It would be easy to try & ignore revalations in this matter, but look at what has transpired over the last 80 yrs. & the direction that the US is heading presently. Today Iraq -next iran? Who will be next or will it be more on a reginal uprising against the US & Isreal.

Statistics show that violent crimes per ca-pita have gone down in the united states for more than 20 years in a row and that includes domestic violence crimes. Growth is only perceived because the information is more readily available. This may not be true in your personal vantage point because you or someone you know may be a victim (which I feel bad about), but statistics do not lie.

I agree with the others.  I went into yahoo search with both words and Pasterella is a bacteria found in animals the can make a bite wound become infected. While, Hemophillus (influenza) is what you would need a HIB shot to prevent.  If you need more information it is easily be accessed through yahoo or google.

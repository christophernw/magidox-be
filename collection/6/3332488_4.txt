For those who really into outdoors and rock climbing, they won't have any problems..or some people might say,used to the slippery,muddy, sharp edges and the insects and other slippery creatures that you would find or come across espesially at mount kinabalu..Kinabalu has some of the richest oak forests in the world with over 40 different oak species recorded. . . Here the Summit Trail itself starts, marked at intervals of 5 chains (50 chains = 1 km.; 80 chains = 1 mile), leading past the Power Station and following the crest of a narrow ridge that dips down onto the main slopes of Kinabalu itself. A little further on, there is a waterfall where waterbottles can be filled. This is known as Carson's Falls, named after the first Warden of this Park. Liverworts and mosses grow luxuriantly in the fine spray of water. A Common moss is Dawsonia, one of the largest in the world, that can reach 3ft (1 m) in height. though it is usually much less. Nearby the KINABALU BALSAM (Impatiensplatyphylla) can usually be found, a delicate little herb growing in between rocks at the edge of the path. Rhododendrons are now more common - the SLENDER- LEAVED RHODODENDRON (Rhododendron stenophyllum) is a lovely sight in bloom.

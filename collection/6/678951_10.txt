Just as you don't want anyone telling you that you can't believe in Jesus, I don't want anyone telling me I can't have a beer and smoke some cigarettes.  And maybe Islam does prohibit alcohol.  They also seem to encourage flying planes into buildings filled with innocent people.. . This is a free country.  You have the right to say what  you want and I have the right to flame you for it.  But prohibiting tobacco and alcohol solves nothing.

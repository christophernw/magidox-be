The current US President, George Bush, maintains friendly relationships with Saudi Arabian princes and so does his Father, the Former President Bush.  These friendships go back many years.  I think they have mutual interests in Oil and the USA has Military Bases in Saudi Arabia.. Perhaps they talk about why the 9/11 terrorists all came from Saudi Arabia?

There are some wrong answers in here. RADAR does NOT detect objects under water! RADAR was first developed by the British around WW2 (actually before) for detecting enemy aircraft. The US helped develop the technology, and later put it on ships and in aircraft. It was NOT developed to catch speeders! Although it is used for that purpose.. . RADAR (RAdio Detecting And Ranging) uses very short bursts of radio signals (usually in the upper MHZ to the low GHZ range) to detect objects (aricraft, ships, precpitation, etc). When the burst hits an object, a small portion of the energy is reflected back to the antenna. If you measure the time it takes to receive the reflected energy, you can calculate how far away the object is. Now a days it all computerized, so you dont have to, the computer does. . . Thats the very basics.

God is not a man or woman . he is some thing that we can not imagine . let me tell u an example : there is plane and you made it , you know what is that made of . but when you can not see or touch God you can not say it is man or woman . but God exists . look at the galaxy . look at the sky . can you believe this is all made my accident ???

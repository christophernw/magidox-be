I'm in the same boat.  Except I'm 2 years older than you.  I think getting that degree is psychology was a big mistake.  I tend to over-analyze everything.  :P  . . Anyway, clearly I don't know the answer.  There's a good book with people who have struggled with this very same question.  It's worth a read.  It's called, "What Should I Do With My Life?"  by Po Bronson.

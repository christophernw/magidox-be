it requires money but gas is expensive much more than electricity. i can tell you that gas isnt more cost effective and if converting to propane into a vehicle the milage is 5 to 7 mpg. electricity is generated by coal or fuel oil and very bad for our ozone layer.i wouldnt have an exact figure for conversion to lpg for a home but you would need a 10000 watt generator and a 5000 gallon propane take.natural gas is far more expensive than propane.i can fill a 20 pound tank for ten bucks.the generator will cost about 1500.00 dollars or more if you purchase a kohler.they are made for homes but tthey use gas or diesel fuel.

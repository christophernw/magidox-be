First, try playing a regular, store bought CD instead of one you may have downloaded and made yourself. A lot of times the formatting used on these is not compatible. If the CD still won't play, try a CD lens cleaner kit as you may have build-up on the laser eye. If none of the above works, you likely need a new CD player. Professionally speaking, I would look into either Pioneer or Alpine as they provide some of the best features for the price.

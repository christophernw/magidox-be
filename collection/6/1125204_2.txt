You can induce altered states and hyper-reality by using trance techniques similar to hypnotism.. . Develop your empathy skills try to imagine what it is like to be another person. Do this very seriously, if you are a man, try to imagine what high heel shoes feel like. Try to imagine what it is like to be an African with everyone staring at you in a white area. . . Practice mild self-hypnosis first without trying anything fancy.. . Then read about some alternative culture, look at alternative art, listen to alternative music (rhythm based music not alternative as in rock).. . Put yourself in a trance and think yourself into the other situation. Your empathy skills will help here because you will become used to not thinking about yourself. . . Then you can hopefully achieve depersonalization, derealization and hyperreality. All three can also be acheived through drugs, however you will have more control.. . Hallucinations in and of themselves are not a good idea. Even people who use drugs to achieve the above three practice meditation and trancing to "control the trip".. . Some are successful at this, some not so.. . Hyperreality is what you are looking for. It is drawing mental inspiration for living your personal life. It is not spiritual, although some spiritualities can help some people do it. Hyperreality only comes when you stop thinking about yourself and stop thinking about immediate stimulus.. . People with a large "god spot" in their brains achieve it spiritually.

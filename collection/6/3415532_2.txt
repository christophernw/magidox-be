It's not a natural thing.  It's inviting strangers into the most intimate part of you.  . . They are "embarrassed" because there IS inside each of us something we used to call our conscience.  It's that still, small voice inside telling us that something is wrong or what we are doing is wrong.  Of course, in our money hungry society, those voices are drowned out by those who want to separate you from your money.  . . How do you ever expect to relate to an actual person?

When you go to college, you will need to be prepared to take all the pre-vet requirements...Chem I and II, Physics I and II, Biology I and II, Organic Chem I and II, Microbiology, Calculus, etc. It is best if you have a strong background in these beforehand, such as in high school, because at the college level they are very difficult. Volunteering with animals at a shelter or with a vet is also a great idea.

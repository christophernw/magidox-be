many ethical issues are philosophical issues because the nature of an ethical issue is that there is a problem with no clear solution. A solution can be reached which would need to stem from some sort of overlapping consensus between to two sides of the argument.  However, in order for this 'solution' to be 'the best' it would need to be able to be applied to every possible problem, with a degree of variance, like the original (a universal 'truth' or one of Kant's 'Categorical Imperatives').  When it comes to trying to figure out solutions for individual problems and seeing if it can be universally applied is when a lot of the debating is going to start.

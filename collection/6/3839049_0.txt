If the coordinates of the centre of the circle be (a,b) and its radius be 'r', then the equation representing this circle on a rectangular coordinate system is (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2. If the tangent has got to be vertical it has to touch the circle on either left or right of the circle. Further as any tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle throught the point of tangency so the radius, here, must be horizontal (as tangent is vertical). So the equation of the vertical tangent is either x = a + r (tangent on right side of circle) or x = a - r (tangent on right side of circle).

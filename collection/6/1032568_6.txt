Spirit is the pure intelligence within and behind everything that is. Soul is the primal conceptualization (seed) of each aspect of that intelligence or spirit. Thus everything has a soul but most souls either do not have the capacity or simply fail to realize their own spirit--let alone see that all is One Spirit or God.

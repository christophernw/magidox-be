ok. . first, it's 9 minutes, not 18. Try 9 for a start. I hate to think what eggs can taste like after 18 minutes (and I guarantee they're very hard already after 9 minutes). . second, what works best for me is not to just leave them under running cold water, but rather let them rest in standing, cold water.  This way they get cooled more thoroughly and brutally, and this seems to help a lot with the peeling.. . and as a side benefit, you'll be saving a lot of water.

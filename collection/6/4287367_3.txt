well those who are bipolar change moods alot and very quickly, literally. one moment they can be determined to finish a project then one second later they'll just suddenly decide to go exercise. they have a problem with finishing things. but to get more info go to a website like webmd.com they have a lot of info. or do some research...wikipedia might have something. and depression is believed to be a chemical imbalance. where no matter how hard you try you find it very difficult to be happy. this can affect your daily life if not treated, sometimes it can lead to suicide because you believe you are worthless and meaningless. . . but i'm not a doctor, so if you think you or someone else is bipolar or depressed, you should go see a doctor to get professional help.

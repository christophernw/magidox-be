I wish that someone answers or say something sensible for one time in their lives rather than speaking out of grudge or hatred.. The reason behind the constant turmoil in third world countries is that the majority of the middle east countries are  not happy with Israel being a part of the middle east, and they constantly fight it, if only they understand that the existence of Israel as a country is very important to establish peace in the middle east.. from a religious perspective, you may see that 99% of middle east countries are Muslims, Islam has a complete different formation than Judaism and Christianity, making it hard for acceptance, people who follow this religion mostly fall in the trap of worshiping God or fulfilling their own desires. Since Islam has a lot of (don’ts) Muslims get confused and start grouping to form Islamic unity against wrong (from their own perspective) , then you either see extremities going around and spreading chaos to their countries being terrorists or dictatorates, or you might see the opposite, Muslims who are not interested at all in Islam and just want to live according to the western assortments.. the constant shaking relations between governments lead other countries to act as a problem solvers or so called (peace makers) .. Developing countries with Oil, are dependant, they don’t have industrial revolutions, all their cars, machines, even cheese is imported from outside, they exchange oil for money. . The whole game is about “Oil” ,which is the reason behind most of the turmoils,chaos.. if there were no oil in Gulf countries – part of the middle east- there wont be  any recognition at all and no one will be interested in them.. Look at Africa ( poor counties) millions are dying from poverty and starvation ..who cares, anybody?. I just advise you to stop worrying cause it will only consume your Peace of Mind.

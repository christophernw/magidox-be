Well you have 2 choices with this phone and i recommend using a card reader  it will be faster than using the data cable believe me. Also if your phone came with the data cable and drivers for the phone use bitpim is a free program and as 11/16/2006 they just came out with a new ver of the program with support for the LG vx8500(Chocolate).. Is a very easy program to use i just got my girlfriend a chocolate this past Wednesday and i was just playing with it today and i did a lot of transfers of tones and wallpapers and bitpim was awesome and easy to use.. But for music and such use the card reader instead.. Also bitpim comes with  an audio converter that will convert your tones to the correct ones before uploading to the phone.. Go below to get the program.

We were created to be in God's image spiritually and we were perfect.  Once Satan deceived Eve in the Garden of Eden, we became imperfect. . . Adam and Eve were to spend eternity walking and talking with God in the Garden of Eden.  Once Eve was deceived, all of that changed and God then set a plan into motion whereby His children would be able to make the choice to serve and follow Him or serve and follow Satan.  . . Once Eve ate of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, she and Adam were removed from the Garden of Eden, not to be punished, but to prevent them from eating from the Tree of Life.  . . By eating from the first tree, our spirits died and were in a state of sin.  By eating of the Tree of Life, that condition would exist forever because then our life would be of sin and there would be no way to redeem God's children.  . . God's plan now is a plan of reconciliation of all of His children back to him prior to the period of Tribulation and Second Coming. . . Good question.  You inadvertently asked a very complex theological question but a good, thought provoking one.

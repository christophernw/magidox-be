I think the tower of Babel is a bunch of baloney.  We speak the same language in the US but look how it differs from region to region.  Television probably keeps us from getting to far afield in our language but imagine thousands of years of living without outside communication.  We change our language all the time now, if we lived in a closed society our language would evolve to a point that it would be completely different.  Mass communication may move us toward a language of the world that we can all understand but not for a long time.

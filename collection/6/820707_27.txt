They don't do nice.  A no solicitor sign might help if you enforce it, but I put a NO JW sign and didn't let them on the porch and didn't discuss nothing with them.  Finally they gave up.  Oh yes, I called the Kingdom Hall and really complained,  They have a stay away list like the Mormons.. . They aren't Christian, and their Bible is not an authorized translation by ANY of the major Christian organizations.  They have been taught and brainwashed to have all the answers, you can't compete with them intellectually.

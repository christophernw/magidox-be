Well I've been home-schooled since I was 3 and now I'm 15 and still home schooled. My Parents Taught me from the age of 3-11 than, my parents hired me private tutors (from the GCSE home-learning NEC) to teach me, and now I'm taking my exams a year early! It is pretty hard, because all the work i'm doing is really advanced and I have to do about 10 hours of work a day.

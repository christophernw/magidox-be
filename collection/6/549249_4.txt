It depends entirely what you mean by 'spiritual attack'.. . If you mean that you feel you are being attacked by evil spirits, then call on the name of the Good Spirit in humility and with trust. You will not be harmed and you will be shown the way to deal with the attack. You may also get more than you bargained for, since it is one way in which Good can enter your heart.. . If you mean that you are feeling extremely 'spiritual'. Relax and empty your mind. Ask to be shown what you need to know.

I think there are many reasons...laziness, lack of political interest.  But the one I hear more than others is "I didn't like any of the candidates."  which is comlete BS to me.  I tell my friends who give that lame excuse that although there may not be an "ideal" canidate for them, if they would take the initiative and learn a bit about the candidates and their platforms (not from a 30 second tv commercial) that they would find in most cases, there is a candidate that actually suits them.  I take voting very seriously and realize that many, many people have died giving us that freedom and allowing us to keep it...I wish everyone felt that way.

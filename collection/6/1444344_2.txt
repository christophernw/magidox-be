I think that it has something to do with more obligations and responsibilites taking up our time. When we are younger, most of our time is focused on leisurely activities. As we grow older, there is more things to do and it always seems that there is never enough time to do it. I am twenty-two and I have noticed this since I graduated high school. Good Question...

I gotta say it's just the California syndrome. I used to live in Orange county till i was 24. I go back to visit my family who lives in o.c. and san diego and i really just see sooo much vanity all over. Noone respects anyone..not even themselves! They just live to get money and spend it. It's really very sad. I didn't like san diego mainly because of the uncleanliness. I think It has a lot to do with it being so close to T.J.

Because they don't tell it like it is. What you've been listening to is called the "the health and wealth gospel". It is not the gospel of self sacrifice that Jesus preached. He said that to follow Him you had to be willing to pick up your cross and follow Him. Well, ask yourself what do you do with a cross? Where did Jesus go with His? To Calvary, to lay down His life on our behalf. We're supposed to follow that example.. . He said He would prepare a place for us in heaven not on this earth. If you're blessed with some prosperity here, great! Be thankful and a faithful steward of that but it's temporary. Your true reward awaits in Heaven. There, all tears will be wiped away for good. In this life we face trials and pain. Hence, we're told to weep with those who weep.

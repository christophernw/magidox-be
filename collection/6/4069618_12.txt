I have three rules to help people win friends.. . The most important thing to remember is that the advice "just be yourself" is misleading. You need to be the BEST version of yourself, not just the person who wakes up in the morning.. . Rule 1: Take care of your appearance. Looks count in this world, and when you look good, you feel good. You need to make sure that you style your hair, wear clothes that fit you and are attractive, go to the gym or start walking/running, clean up your car and your house. Take time to assure that you look as good as you can.. . Rule 2: Actually talk to people. You aren't going to have friends fall from the sky. People like people they can talk to, and wallflowers are not easy to talk to. Be a person who starts conversations, a person who says "hello" to people, even those she doesn't know!. . Rule 3: Don't be creepy/Be normal. This rule is sort of nebulous. What you want to do is showcase your good and tone down your bad habits. Don't pick your nose in public and don't obsess about american idol or star wars. Talk about current events or school politics or fashion, I'm not saying conform and I'm not saying give up care bears, I'm just saying be normal, at least at first.

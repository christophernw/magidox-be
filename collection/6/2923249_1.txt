you need to get something that will knock you out for a while, that is the only thing that works for me.  The doctor prescribed 'Imagrin' for me but the problem with that is that in Australia it is about $30 per tablet and they come in packs of 2 - try mersyndol or an equivalent something that will knock you and the pain out.  One doctor suggested that I could take panadol and nurofen at the same time because they are different - people will say don't take this or that but when you have a migraine then really anything that works is better than the pain.

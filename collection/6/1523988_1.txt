This really depends on what you are into and what you hope to gain from the experience.  Miami is truly an experience.  If it is sun and fun then you won't have to look too far...it's everywhere.  If you are looking for nightlife then South Beach is your best choice. For a Latin  experience you need to go down to s.w. 8 street., and for shopping there is no place like the malls in Miami.  If you want to do the tourist attractions the don't miss Metro Zoo or the Seaquriam.  Monkey Jungle is also a lot of fun.  What ever you do don't miss going to BaySide on any given weekend for a really fun cultural day.  Just go into any of the Larger Hotel lobbies and pick up a tourist guide.  No matter what you are into Miami has something to offer.  Have A great time !

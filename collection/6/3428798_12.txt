Contrary to the atheistic propaganda machine, most religious people do not reject science and technology.  I know with Christians, we are able to use things like philosophy, logic, reason and science to our benefit.  Each of those areas has a voice in speaking of Gods existence and helping us to know more about God and his relationship to us.. . The only problem with regard to science is that it only explores 1 mechanical/physical area of our existence; the natural world.  In other words it asnwers the WHAT or HOW Q's in life, not the WHY which is most important.

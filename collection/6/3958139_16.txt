Atheists are hardly depressed. We're just sick and tired of people judging us as immoral and sub-human because we don't believe in anything.. . As far as the "nagging", turnabout's fair play. Atheists "nagging" to quit religion or that religion is worthless(others' thoughts, not mine! I personally don't give a rat's behind if someone's religious or not, regardless of whether or not I agree) is no different than a Christian or anyone else "nagging" an Atheist to repent and go to church and believe in God or risk going to Hell.

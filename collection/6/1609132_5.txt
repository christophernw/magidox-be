Steve Irwin's qualifications. the way i see it he is only qualified to do one of two things .#1 is to do what he does ,running a zoo full of large tooth filled monsters from the past . or # 2 president of the united states . I know , I know . you have to be born in US to run for president. but wouldn't that make for some great state of the union addresses. lmao

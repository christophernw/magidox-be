Because is you see a pie from above it looks like a circle.. And the "math pie" is usually divided into areas (for excercises) just as when you but pieces from a pie (in angles from the center).. That's what i think.... Its easier to identify the figure if you have something in daily life to match it with.. . Goodluck!

Children can see right through most bullsh*t, and they are much more tenacious than people give them credit for. . . Just because kids are small and young doesn't mean that when they cry, it's any less painful. When you're a kid, sometimes it's frustrating that people still talk to you as if you're 4 when you're 8... there's a big difference. I think adults forget this, which is funny, because you would think we'd know this having been children ourselves. . . Adults think that children are horrors or cherubs, leaving no room for them to just be people. Adults are surprised and creeped out when children say or do profound things, forgetting that all brains young and old say and do all kinds of things in the continual quest for growth and knowledge.

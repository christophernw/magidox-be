He really didn't say the soldiers were dumb but was trying to make a really stupid joke.. Goes to show that He must not have studied hard himself.. which is why.. His grades were worse than GW.. He had to write his own recommendation for a medal.. He voted against Iraq before he voted For Iraq.. He couldn't get elected to the Presidency.. . Sounds pretty stupid of him to go to all this trouble of opening his mouth and sticking his foot in it.. . By the way. the percentage of  people in the Military who have high school diplomas or higher education is considerably higher than in the general population, so it isn't true that only uneducated people end up in the military. . People are stupid who believe that because they think themselves better than military folk. How Elitist to think so.. Most Democrats are the elitists. They think that Blacks and Hispanics are dumb and cannot get ahead without Government help.. Of course this isn't true, Many Blacks and Hispanics are Middle Class (as is my best friend) and worked hard to get educated and or start their own businesses, but democrats think that those are anomalies.

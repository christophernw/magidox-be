This is why alot of folks don't accept checks.  I think you can call his or her bank daily and ask if there are funds available to cover the check.  If there is get that sucker cashed right away.  I know I used to do that when I worked collections for a utility company.  I never had a bank or teller tell me I couldn't ask.  Otherwise your looking at small claims court which will cost you the money your trying to collect.

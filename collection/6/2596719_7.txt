my mother always said Christianity begins at home ,you should take care of your mum and dad first then your family and friends as well as your neighbor's ,treat them as you would like to be treated and you will be on the road to a good christian .never do to others what you would not wish upon yourself .its easy to go to church on Sunday in your best clothes to say prayers sing hymns and shout hallelujah but what about the rest of the time .you see standing in a church does not make you a christian because on that principal standing in a hospital would make you a doctor , you have to practice and believe .

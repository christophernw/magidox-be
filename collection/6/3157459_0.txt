When I told my best friend of 6 years about my confusion and my then resent experience with a female,  she told me that she has been in love with me for 2 years and that she was so happy that I found myself. She also was afraid to loose our friendship and that was the reason she has loved me in silence for that long.  I was so mad at her I try so hard to stay the hell away form her. But I love my best friend so much I dint want to loose her.  Here we are 5 months after, living together as couples and in the final stage of her divorce.  I was once one of those homophobic people.

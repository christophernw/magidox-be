I just want to point out that there are two appropriate answers here.  First, rule of thumb does come from the old English law dictating the thickness of a rod which a husband may use to beat his wife.  Second, that the rule of Thome (English Lord) is another expression which preceeded and may have co-evolved or merged with rule of thumb.

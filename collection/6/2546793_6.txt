I make Ukranian Easter eggs (pysanky), so I've done a lot of this. It may be too late if you're decorating eggs for this Easter, but I recommend a little pump that's made specifically for this job. My favorite is the Blas-Fix.. http://www.relativelycrafty.com/main/eggsupplies.htm. You only have to put one hole in the egg (it comes with a little hand "drill," which is nice), then you insert a tiny metal tube into the hole and gently squeeze the little "accordian" plastic bulb. The air forces the egg out of the same hole. You can then fill the bulb with water and pump water into the egg to rinse out the inside.. . I used to use the actual blowing method, but this is SO much easier.

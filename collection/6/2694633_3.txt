The negative aspect to failure is what is lost through it.  Everyone preaches taking risks but at what costs?  Are you willing to go into business, fail, and loss your house?  How does that affect the rest of the family?  Are you willing to marry a guy you've only known a short time and end up divorced, raising kids without help?  To fail on a Math exam is one thing, to fail at a major life issue is another.

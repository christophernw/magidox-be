most people say that its just a mere nothing that when you go into it, the gravitational pull can pull you from here to there until you die or something but some other people say its a wormhold (is that it?) and when you enter it you go to another dimension thats why when people or robots go in there they dont know how to get back. though still all in all its a mystery since all of that is bullcrap becuase there is no complete evidince that those theory are true.

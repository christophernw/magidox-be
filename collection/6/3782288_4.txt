They don't have voiceboxes and lip/tongues the same as ours (so they couldn't form words), they don't have a "conciousness" needing such a large vocabulary and, even if they did, do your seriously think cats would use English anyway?  Oh no, you would *have to* learn Cat language if you wanted to communicate coz they're stubborn little oiks!. . Cats have variations on the noises they make for whatever they want to say such as: food, I want affection, mate, I am displaeased, I am happy, go away, this is mine etc... it's a simple life.

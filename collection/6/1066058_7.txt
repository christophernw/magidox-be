Hunter S. Thomson "He who makes a beast out of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man" i love this quote, it makes so much sence in the world today, we have people that don't want to deal with problems so they get into a self destructive pattern..i use this quote to remind me not to give into temptation, and to think for myself, becasue we have enough beasts out there.

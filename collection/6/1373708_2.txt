To stereotype both sides a little to start with: . . Democrats tend to be more socially conscious and want progress and reform.  That is stressful feeling a social responsibility to help and seeing all of the problems with the world..   . Republicans tend to want to keep things where they are and are more concerned with themselves, since they put responsibility for individuals to help themselves.. . The questions are very subjective though.  So, for example, it is possible a group of Republicans would answer the survey saying they are happy and a group of Democrats answer they are not, but if outside observers watched how they lived their lives and their overall mood, they might see it much differently than the people they are observing do because of different ideas of happiness.. . Maybe Democrats are setting the bar higher for happiness, or maybe even when the Democrats are in power, the people still feel that the government is too far to the right.  Maybe the easier it is for you to be happy, the more likely you will be a Republican.. . These kind of surveys are fascinating, but they shouldn't be taken at face value (i.e. in this case, it can't simply be said Republicans are happier).  It is impossible to completely control an experiment through asking people subjective questions.  There are too many variables, but it interesting to think what those variables might be. . . (The religion issue brought up is also a great point)

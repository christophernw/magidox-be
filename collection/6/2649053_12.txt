The farts attained disgust during the supremacy of British colonialism. The British with their stiff upper lips always had an antipathy towards the chubbier lower lips. They could control the words from their mouth but could not control the farts escaping from their bottom. Since they ruled on a large part of the globe, they were control freak and fart was a open challenge to their supremacy. In 1822 Lord Smith Whitekar passed an order  to restrain people from farting in public gatherings and official function but as luck would have it a loud one escaped his butts for which he later became a laughing stock. Indians, Latinos, and  a large part middle east and Africa consider fart as a sign of health. A good monotone (clean single single note pitch)fart is a sign of healthy digestion while the silent nostril inflaming ones are a sign of weak bowel. In India a loud fart is also associated with high class and affluent people. Who ever find it disgusting will surely agree that the comfort and the pleasure of letting of a fart is unmatched and thrilling.

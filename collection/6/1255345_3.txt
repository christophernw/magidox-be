ADD is Attention Deficit Disorder. I have Adult ADD it is where you can not focus. I went to my doctor told him my symptoms. DOC gave me some medication it makes me focus and my grades in college are improving. I could nt focus wht was going on I was worried about everything else around me. Now I have to go see a neurologist so that he can determine that I need medication all the time

Amen sister.  That is what I have been saying.  Everywhere I go I see these little blond morons being adored by guys who only care about getting laid.  I don't know why this happens, but lets face it, guys are just plain shallow.  The good news is there are a few good guys out there who aren't obsessed with dating a supermodel.  I know everyone says that but I have seen it happen.  My friend is engaged now, she is really tall and used to be super skinny (she was anorexic).  Now she is better, and has put on a little weight, but she is still very pretty.  She has been with her boyfriend throughout all of her weight fluctuations and he always tells her she is beautiful.  I am also a big woman, so I know what it is like to be ignored when you go to a club or a bar, or only to be thought of as a friend of the girls the guys really want.  But hey, I think I will meet someone eventually and I am not going to waste my time worrying what a bunch of jerks think about me.  Cuz I know I am a good person and any guy would be lucky to have me.  So I am going with the flow and I'm not going to obsess over meeting a guy.  Cuz you know the minute you stop looking is when you meet someone.  So hold your head up and remember that those empty-headed girls will be wrinkled has-beens in about 20 or so years, depending on how much tanning they do.  And we will still have our brains and wit.

I don't want to be prejudiced towards the Muslim community but they are either the silent majority or the silent minority. In any case silent. Many of the clerics are quite radical and have screamed for the deaths of westerners. It is bad enough when. lay people behave violent but their religious are supposed to set the example and go unchallenged by those that say it is a peaceful religion. I see a few from the Muslim community telling us violence is wrong but they don't tell it to the violent ones in their religion and fear of retaliation does not cut it because you either srand up for God or give into man. You can't have it both ways. If any clergy in my religion were screaming for Muslim deaths I'd ask them if they rewrote the bible because that is not Jesus' s message.

It has to do with not looking the other way when someone wants to cook the books.. . It can be as simple as a CPA entering expenses that are questionable they are business expenses all the way to enron.. . Coaching people how to interact with you so you don't break any of your own ethics rules (you being used to refer to a CPA) is exactly the same thing. For example a I knew someone running an espresso stand that kept two sets of books, one for themselves and one for the CPA cause he said he couldn't do any cooking of the books. Well, he cooked them by telling the customer how. That is a lack of ethics by that CPA.

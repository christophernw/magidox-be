I don't know of a way to prolong an orgasm for a male, but there are ways of intensifying your orgasm.. For one, stimulating the testicles is a winner. While your partner goes down on you, gently alternating between this and gently sucking can really help. Or, finding the spot between the anus and the testicles and gently massaging in a circle. This helps to stimulate your prostate and increase the amount of blood flow, intensifying the orgasm. I hope that this helps you.

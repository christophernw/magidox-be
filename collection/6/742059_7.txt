If the Vietnam war is so like the Iraq one explain to me how did the Vietnamese attack us on American soil. Also, how do you compare the terrorists in the Iraq war who have declared war on us either on their soil or ours campares with the enemy in the VN war. I fail to see the likenesses and these issues are the most important aspect of the war.

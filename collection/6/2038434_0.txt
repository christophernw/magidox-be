If you are trying to remove the entire headliner, you will first need to remove both sunvisors in the front. After that, remove all pillars (next to windshield, above doors, between front and back doors, above back doors, next to rear window). You will also need to remove the dome light, and if your vehicle has a sunroof, you will need to remove the surround of the sunroof. After all is done, there should simply be plastic 'push pins' holding it in place and it should come right down.

The highest temperature attainable using the sun light is the "surface" temperature of the sun (approximately 6000 degrees Kelvin). The can be done by using large mirrors to focus light onto an object. Provided the object were adequately insulated, it would reach thermal equilibrium with the sun (and hence reach the same temperature). It cannot get any hotter than that as, if it were hotter, the object would then be heating up the sun.

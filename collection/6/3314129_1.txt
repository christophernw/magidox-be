I asked a similar question and here was the answer I found most helpful. I give the credit to nightevisions. Hope it helps you too.. . It helps to have a relaxing routine before bed. Do something calming. Whatever that might be for you... a warm bath, a hot cup of tea, reading a book... . . If you lie there awake when you go to bed, occupy your mind in a non distressing way. Recite a childhood fairytale such as the 3 Bears... and when your mind starts to wander to everyday worries, pull it firmly back to the story... you'll fall asleep before you get past the porridge!

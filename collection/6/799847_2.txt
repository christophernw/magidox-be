Low lipase level has absolutely no significance medically.  When they set up a "normal range" for medical results, about 5 - 10% of people fall above and below that range.  It is like saying a man is only 5 feet tall, he is below the normal range but that does not affect his health.  Don't worry.  You are normal!

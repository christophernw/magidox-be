A real cat fight is easily noted becuase it is LOUD!  I mean screams and screeches and fur flying and 2 cats locked belly to belly biting neck, clawing face and kicking... you can't miss it.. . By your description of what your two cats are doing, sounds like they are playing "mock" battle.  Sometimes though, cats doing this can get a bit carried away, so when they get too rowdy, stop the "fight" by squirtung water over them (I used to pour or throw a cup of water over rowdy cat mock fights) - only way to stop cats fighting without you sustaining some injury.

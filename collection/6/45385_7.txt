Are you talking about literal polygamy (one man, several women), or are you also talking about polyandry (one woman, several men)? Personally, I think it's due to irrational prejudice. Consenting adults should be allowed to enter into any relationship that pleases them, whether it's a traditional marriage, polyandry, or just remaining single and indulging in sex with a skilled prostitute of either sex.

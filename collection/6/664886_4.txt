"The more you resist, the more it persists".. . I've had atheists tell me that they think my religion is a bunch of hooey.  My answer, generally, is a shrug and "OK".. . Maybe that's why atheists don't "go after" Pagans; we don't really care that they don't believe as we do because we know that our path isn't right for everyone, and thus have no need to try to convince them that we are "RIGHT* (and they, as a consequence, are *WRONG*)

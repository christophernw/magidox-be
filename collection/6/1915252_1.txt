calligraphy was tricky in the old days so that "uu" looked very much like "vv", and a 'w' did not look much different.. English is not the only language that spells "w" as 'double u'; French does it and Italian too.. Moreover, there is no first person who invented the names of the letters. This developed slowly by convention.

Because Israel has the full support of US no matter what...Even if the UN is trying to do something US is going to veto any sanction against them...And even if someone would say anything about what the IDF has done in those six days,they would be called antisemitic...and then we are reminded about the Holocaust(which in Europe is a really sensitive subject) as a justification of what Israel is doing in the Palestinian territories.... I really wonder if someone is going to be punished for what happened this morning in Beit Hanoun...although I doubt it... . and ,no ,of course the Israeli government won't be put on trial like the Saddam regime...

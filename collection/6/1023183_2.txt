Reverse osmosis water has been passed through a membrane that selectively excludes a certain percentage of the minerals (or other impurities) in water so it may take a couple passes through a reverse osmosis process to produce water that is pretty much equivalent to deionized water. Literally however deionized water has no impurities in the form of ions such as metals like calcium aand magnesium. So deioized has no ions and RO water may still have a few ions in it.

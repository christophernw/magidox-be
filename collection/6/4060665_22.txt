Baptism is a means of grace, by which the Holy Spirit works faith in our hearts. . . Baptism is a seal, or sign, of God's covenant with us in Christ.. . I understand your reluctance from a human logic standpoint. But faith and the power of the Holy Spirit isn't about our intellectual capacity. Consider this, God's covenant with the Abraham (and subsequent Jews) was circumcision. Why were babies circumcised when they were only 8 days old? Doesn't logic dictate that they should wait until they are older to see if they want to embrace/accept the covenant relationship with God? It wasn't about our acceptance of God, its about God's acceptance of us..... . BTW: After reading the other responses I'd like to comment.. Baptism is not a "get into heaven free card". While baptism's efficacy is the power of the Holy Spirit, it doesn't make one "automatically saved". The word of God works faith in our hearts, but that doesn't mean that all hearers our saved.. . There is no such scriptural teaching as the oft mentioned "age of accountability"...or the idea that children are "sinless until a certain age". The Bible clearly teaches that we are born sinful.. . Finally, the "burden of proof" to not baptize children lies with those who chose not to. Christian baptism was preceded by the Jewish proselyte rite. Families, including children, were baptized upon conversion (which parallels the account of Cornelius in the book of Acts).. . We should never be legalistic about how/when to perform baptism. Those who insist on such things are missing the point of "grace" (in my opinion).

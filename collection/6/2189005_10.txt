Some medications can cause changes in urine color - if you're on any prescriptions, read the info for them - also, if any food you've been eating (frosting, for example, or soda) has a lot of dye in it, it could change it.. . You said you've been drinking a lot of water, but have you been sweating a lot, working out, ect?  Might not be enough water.

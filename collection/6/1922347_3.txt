lol they don't.. pick up a biology book if you have time.  Spontaneaous generation is not possible.  The closest it gets is chemical evolution... which is a way of combining amino acids in hopes of creating life... and that is not even possible. A fly probably got into the fruit and laid eggs... or some other bug.

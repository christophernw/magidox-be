whoa amazing answers and I should point out that some people do unfortunately dig up Dead Bodies anyways.. . A good example is a girl told me that when her Great Grandpa died they could not get the Diamond Ring off him so he was buried with it but some guy who wound out about the Diamond Ring wound up digging it up to steal it off the Dead Body.. . The Criminal was caught and the Diamond Ring handed over to the Girl's Grandmother.

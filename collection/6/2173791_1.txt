Note stevenaives example, but also standard deviation can be better interpreted if you then use this to calculate the coefficient of variance (or % relative standard deviation).  This is calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean, then multiplying by 100 to give you a percentage.  In analytical terms a low percentage such as <5% is a very good analytical precision, where as in biochemical terms a higher value such as <10% is acceptable, and in biological assays the %RSD can be expected to be very high.  To give better examples, I would need to know what context in which you are asking the question.

Well now, there is an idea!!  Unfortunately we would need to undo around 150 years of law and other efforts to eliminate the poll (voting) tax that was in common use in the early days of the republic.  But I have an idea.  Let's go ahead and do it, and let's set the price at something I can afford, but you cannot!. . Get the drift?

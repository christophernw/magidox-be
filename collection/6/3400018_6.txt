Out of a population of humans with various memory powers, the ones whose memories were better didn't fall down so may holes (because they remembered where they were) or chase so many sabre-toothed tigers (because they rembered seeing Og get eaten), so when the survivors bred, they had an increased chance of their offspring having better memory powers.  And so on and so on.  Self-selective breeding.

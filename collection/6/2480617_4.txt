Here is an online copy of the Douay Rheims bible (the purest translation of St. Jerome's work). It also has asterisks next to the books that were omitted by the heretical piece of work put together by the Protestants  http://www.drbo.org/. . Most "Catholic bibles" today are not Catholic at all. . . Protestants omitted these books because there are passages in them that help prove the fact that there is no salvation outside the Catholic Church. Missionaries used to burn these Protestant "bibles" because they said it was better to have nothing than to have the heretical book that Protestants claimed was a bible.

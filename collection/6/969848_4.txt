Because if the parent kill, they'll go to hell... and what kind of parent will kill there own baby? Just the kind that don't have a religion. We believe God is the only one that has the right to choose the time of death for us. O, in the word it states: that it’s your own choice to believe in him or not. Look at the movie Bruce Almighty; it’s actually a great massage for all of us, not just a comedy… You are confusing yourself. Enjoy.

Based on 20 years in business, I have found that there are four key factors.. . 1. a genuine and sincere interest and belief in the product being sold. Potential customers can smell Bull from a mile, if the sales person does not believe in the product being offered, it won't sell.. . 2. Dedicated persistence. Its a numbers game the more calls being made the more sales that are made. The old line that every sales person knows is 1 in 10 will say yes therefore every no just leads you that closer to a yes.. . 3. Product and industry knowledge. The sales person must be a expert on his or her product and how it fits within the larger industry. If they don't know it, they can't sell it.. . 4. Good personal networks. The more potential qualified customers they know the more they can sell. Sales is built on trust. The person doing the selling must be trusted by his/her customers. Knowing a lot of potential customers allows a jump start over the old "cold call". . And finally there is one more thing; strong support from the company that they are selling for. If you as the employer don't provide them with a good product, good information, good sales support and strong moral support, they can't do their job well.

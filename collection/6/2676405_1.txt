well running helps, some people hate running (i do too) but if u keep at it long enough it wont be tiring. also try lifting weights to get those muscles. swimming is good too. to get those wave try playing with your hair a bit, i know this one guy who used to play with his hair everyday in class and he had these awesome waves, u can also try air drying ur hair, then blow drying it

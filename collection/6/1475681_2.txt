One of the big problems in Bergen  County, NJ, especially in towns like North Bergen and surrounding areas, is that 15 or 20 illegals will crowd into a single apartment.  Chinese are just as bad.  All these people have a habit of severe overcrowding, and they turn neighborhoods into pigstys.. . Deporting them all would be a godsend.

Depends on what you mean by that.  If you spent it foolishly, you have to work hard and earn it again. If you accidentally paid too much, or bought an item that you recently purchased, you can take it back to the store and ask the customer service department to pay you back. If you lent it to someone, you just ask them nicely.

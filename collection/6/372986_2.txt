There is no way really. And if you some how manage to convince them to get you a dog, the dog will end up being neglected because it will be YOUR responsibility, not your parents. That means YOU will have to walk him, and feed him and brush him and YOU will have to pay his expensive vet bills. A child should never own a dog. If your parents really don't want you to get a dog, then don't. Wait until you're old enough to live on your own and get a dog then.. . This is just what I see happen a lot, that's why I disagree on a child owning a dog. If anything your new dog should be a FAMILY dog, so then he is every ones responsibility, not just yours.

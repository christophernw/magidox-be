Long answer, but I have raised many puppies and this works without fail. Take the dog outside every 15 minutes if he went the previous time that you took him out and every 10 minute if he did not go the previous time that you took him out. When he goes outside give him/her lots of verbal and physical praise. If your dog does have an accident inside put their nose in it, if wet, or near it, if soild, to the accident and ONE swat on the butt not too hard though, then put them outside while you clean up.

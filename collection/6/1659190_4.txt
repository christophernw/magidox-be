two ways that I know of.  If you're using long noodles you put your spoon in the left hand and the fork in your right hand.  And you stab the spabhetti with your fork and lift it into the spoon then twirl your fork till you have all the spaghetti wound up.  Then you open wide and stuff it into your mouth and chew.  The alternative is to do without the spoon and make your plate act like the spoon.. . Or, the second way is do like I do...Buy maccaroni noodles, pour the sauce on top (without cooking it) and mix, then you can eat with a spoon with no mess.

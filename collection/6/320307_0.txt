I would say its very important if you have kids...you will be paying taxes that benefit this school and if for some reason you decide that it isn't the right one for your kids you will have to transport them elsewhere and even pay for their tuition in some cases.  Its pretty easy to investigate academic levels of distinction online as well - if you are concerned with the quality of education your child will receive.. If you don't have any children, the school district may dictate how "resellable" your house is to families with children and may also have a lot to do with what kind of neighbors you might expect to deal with in that area.. Bottom line is that its definitely worth investigating prior to buying a house - that way you can weigh your options either way.

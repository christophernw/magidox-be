It all depends on the attachment of the umbilical cord, the tension put on it during the birthing process, the strength of the muscles in the abdomen around the site and the child. (Some kids play so much with there's they can actually weaken the muscles causing them to herniate slightly.) Also affecting the appearance might me surgeries as an infant and prematurity, as some babies are given umbilical lines as they are less traumatic on the neonate.

That happened to em one time when i was pregnant with my oldest and all that happened was that he had ripped me.  If it burns when you pee that is all that has happened. The only thing you can do in that situation is to wait for it to heal.  If it does not burn when you pee then you need to call the DR ASAP like NOW cause no one but your DR can tell you really what is wrong.  But i think you just got ripped a little is all but if you are real worried call your DR.

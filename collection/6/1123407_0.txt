According to the Straight Dope and Wikipedia, the Humpty Dumpty nursery rhyme is a riddle to which the answer was apparently "an egg".  Humpty Dumpty was slang for a short, fat clumsy person, but a person wouldn't shatter on impact, leaving the egg as the logical answer to the riddle.. . I've found far more citations listing Humpty Dumpty as a war machine (see links).. . Personally, I never questioned it because it was always illustrated as an egg.

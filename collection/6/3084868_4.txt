Wittgenstein is a difficult writer to read.  His main contributions were to language and logic, his Tractatuc-Philosophicus deals with to some extent. He distinguishes Logic from the other sciences, which  opposes Frege and Russell's ideas. In this work he claimed to have eliminated all the problems of philosophy, but only 10 years later repudiated that very claim. The man was a genius, but an atheistic and confused genius.  I assume you have a purpose for reading him or is this more or less recreational?  "Here is a hand" is a famous proposition he went on to examine, in his work On Certainty.

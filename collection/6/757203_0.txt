I'd make it so that congress had to call a jury of 12 regular americans after the president signs a bill into law.  If all 12 americans agree that any one (or more) lines in the bill is unnecessary or unjust, then that part of the bill is invalidated and the rest goes into law.. . Think about how many unnecessary spending projects and corporate subsidies, and little rules that hurt consumers would be purged from our laws!  It would be awesome.

They assume so because they find it incomprehensible to be able to make positive choices without being told to by a higher authority. Murder is wrong and the law tells me that by charging me for a crime, and if the law didn't state so, the majority of people (aetheists included) still wouldn't do it. My point being those who judge you don't realise that we all live in the same society with the exact same rules and those are what matters most.

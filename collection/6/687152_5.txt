Radon is a gas produced by the natural decay of radium.  Radium is found in trace amounts in a great many places, and normally radon gas is not a problem.  However, since it is a very heavy gas, it tends to collect in places like basements where it can become relatively concentrated and a health hazard.  The remedy is simply to provide some ventilation for the basement.

No... you got it wrong.... there are some avatars that are noted for being rude, irreverant and all they want to do is to push peoples buttons to get a rise out of them... We are suppose to be responsible for our time and knowledge... and it is said.... do not throw pearls before swine... which is a metaphoric saying that you need to be wise who you share your wisdom with... It is not the name... NO... it is the personality that goes with the name that some people avoid or boycott... as they are proven to be irresponsible.

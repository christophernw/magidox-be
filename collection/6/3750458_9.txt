Simply put, the Marines do not fly the A-10 because it does not meet the mission requirements of the Marine Corps.  It is a great attack aircraft but it does not have the capability to take off from a sea based platform such as a carrier or an amphibious assault ship.  The F/A-18, the AV-8B, and the AH-1 sufficiently meet the mission requirements of Marine Aviation.  . . . In response to several answers provided by others, Marine Corps aviation does not have the same mission as the Air Force.  The purpose of Marine Corps aviation is to support the Marine philosophy of combined arms.  The Marine Corps employs combined arms to overwhelm and exploit an enemy's weakness.  Marine aviation is a vital part of the combined arms philosophy.  The Air Force is awesome at what it does, but Marine aviation is unmatched in providing close air support to the fighting Marine on the deck.  . Wolfman and Brian L., I would just like to clarify, the Marine Corps is not part of the Navy.  The Marine Corps is organized under the Department of the Navy but this does not mean that the Marine Corps is part of the Navy.  The Department of the Navy, unlike the Department of the Air Force and the Department of the Army, is responsible for two separate service branches (Navy and Marine Corps).

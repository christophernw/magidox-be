I'm not aware of there being any "fines" for expired vaccines.  The Rabies Vaccine is the only vaccine required by law, but I don't believe you're fined if you don't have it done.  As for the other vaccines, it has recently been widely found that vaccines are not needed every year.  There is a test called a titer test that you can have done to measure how much of the vaccine is still in your dog's system.  Many times, this test has shown that dogs don't need further vaccines for 3+ years...

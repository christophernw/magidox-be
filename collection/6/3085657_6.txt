I bake it with cut-up potatoes and sometimes some onions!  Yummm!  Wish I could get fresh kielbasa here in Salt Lake City.  No Polacks here I guess except me!. . Another method:  Slowly cook kielbasa over open grill, about 20-30 minutes, until done.  Put it on a roll, top with sauerkraut and mustard.  Enjoy!

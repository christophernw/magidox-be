Not all of them do.  True there are those that are not really 'practicing what they preach' but I think many of them do. I pray that if they are like the Bakers were that they get caught for taking funds from the church (or not paying taxes, etc).  But I also look at others out there who don't look all pimped out because they really do believe what they preach.

boil a pot of water on the stove...put the instant ramen pack in or cup noodles...after they're cooked...drain out the water used to boil noodles, put noodles in new water boiled on the side...mix in packet...(reason is: the packaged noodles have a coat of preservatives that are actually toxic...a few yrs ago, a boy who ate only ramen for each meal everyday of the yr died from this poison).... . . I, myself, have not ate this in a lonnnnnng time...high sodium, not that I have hypertension...but one package of noodles is a day's worth of sodium intake...did'ja kno?. . What's more disgusting? One of my co-workers from where I used to work ate Raman noodles raw from the cup noodle container out from the vending machine...

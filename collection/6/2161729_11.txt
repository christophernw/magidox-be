there are no paintings from the actual time. there are paintings from afterwards but they could have been distorted because all of these people relied on oral tradition until the first gospel was written down over 30 years after he died. also only a select few saw Him--this wasnt present times where we can see people on television. they heard about Jesus but a few saw him literally.. . He was pure Jewish. there are white jews today but that is because they traveled from Israel to other nations (europe, hence wwII, south america, etc) He on the other hand was very jewish, straight from the line of David (who was also very Jewish) there wasnt much mix in there of non-jews other than ruth (the only non-jew) who was somewhere in there...I think David's great grandmother.. Pure jews are not blonde...although he mightve had light skin which i doubt was too light cause he walked alot in hot temperatures including that time in desert for 40days.

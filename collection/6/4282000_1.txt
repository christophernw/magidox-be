this is going to sound stuipid, but sometimes the easiest things are overlooked.  that comment about turning off the key while its running makes me think it sounds like its running out of gas, or somehow a short.  as far as the gas goes, have you replaced the fuel filter?  or maybe checked the fuel pump?

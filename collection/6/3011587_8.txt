my ex boyfriend took it without needing it and ended up in the er.  it raises your blood pressure, and it is not anything to play with..it is a prescription drug, and it should only be taken by the person to whom it is prescibed to...unless you want to end up in your local emergency room with a very embarrassing problem, it can cause an erection lasting for hours and start shutting off circulation to your penis, it can be very dangerous!

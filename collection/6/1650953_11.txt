Hey please don't listen to people suggesting of Benadryl for use in your case, if you go through the label itself it clearly says that the content has an addictive nature by itself, rest is up to you... . . Regarding the actual problem it has a very simple solution. If you believe in ancient techniques you can use your own hands to help your wife by simply applying some oil to her the centre of head with light tapping with centre of your open palm. Also toward the back of neck near shoulders and do little massage moving from top of the neck to shoulders in slow moment and applying little pressure with thumbs of your hands and see the benefits from day one itself.... . Milk with honey to taste is also a good remedy for this.... . Hope this helps you out.

In Australia (or where I am) stuffing goes inside the turkey/chook, it is usually made from bread crumbs, herbs, onion, bacon, crushed nuts,butter and the like.. . Dressing is normally something that goes on top of a salad or pasta.  It is normally runny and can be poured (- for example - French dressing).. . They do say a dressed pig or a dressed lamb down here.  That does not mean it is dressed in clothes or any silly thing like that, but it is cut up properly into butchers cuts, ready to cook or freeze.

I am sorry, but responsible parents need to boycott Bratz dolls.   If ever I saw a doll for a pedophile or someone wanting their little girls to grow up and dress like prostitutes....this is it.  . . Parents take control... stop giving in to advertising and your children.  You are suppose to be the adults.. . As to they WHY??? are they made...  Simply... dollars and cents.   People buy them.... so the company makes more.

it could be an infection of the digestive tract (if they have diarrhea as well then that is a big sign that it is it) or an emotional response meaning the person has some sort of anxiety or panic issue. it can really be a number or things though but nothing too serious unless the person vomits often and gets no relief from it or has pain or tenderness in areas of their body. if those are the cases then you need to see the doctor fast.

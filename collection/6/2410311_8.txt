First of all you have to realize God sees things differently then you or I.  His first concern is the welfare of our souls.  Sometimes a little affliction in our lives help us grow.. . Also he tests us.  He tests the person with an affliction to see how he handles it.  He also tests others to see how they treat that person.  By helping others we become worthy to sit at Christ's right hand.  That is would not be possible in a perfect world.

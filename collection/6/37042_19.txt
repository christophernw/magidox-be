Wow, there are so many reasons.. Some parents choose to home school their children because they want a better invironment for their children, some don't have the money for private or Christian but just don't like the way public schools are run these days.. I respect people's desire to home school their children and appreciate my parents teaching me at home. As a result I was very well-behaved as a child and people remarked on that all through my childhood.

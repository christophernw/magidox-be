I'd have to go with over 2,000,000 died AFTER we left.. . The effect on the US morale was pretty terrible, as well.  Vietnam vets and widows (and wives of MIA's) have never fully recovered or found the place of honor they deserve in our society.. . Some of us lost our love affair with all things French, as well.

Take her outside very often. At least every hour if the puppy is very young.. . When it is outside and if it goes to the bathroom, immediately praise it as bring it back inside. It will soon learn what "outside" is for.. . Clean out the kennel VERY WELL . Take all bedding out and wash them. Take kennel apart and sanitize with bleach water then rince well. (every single inch-inside/outside, sides, bottom, top, floor and ceiling). . It probably smells the urine and makes it want to go.

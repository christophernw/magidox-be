The phrase "in antiquity" is usually used by historians and archaeologists to describe something which happened or was made in pre-biblical times. For example the sentence "the tombs of the Pharoes were robbed in antiquity" would denote that they were robbed in times contemporary to the burial, rather than indicating they were robbed in say, 1789 AD. An "antique" refers to something which is over 100 years old.

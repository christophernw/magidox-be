There is a very easy way to get the perfect hard-boiled egg.  Put your eggs in the water with salt and bring them to a rapid boil.  then shut them off and cover them for 15 minutes.  Don't let them continue to  boil.  Take them completely off the burner if you have to.  Make sure they are completely covered then after 15-18 minutes are up, put the entire pot under the cold water and let it run until the eggs are cool to the touch.  the yolks will not be green and the shell will come right off.  just be sure to run the egg under the water when you are done unless you like crunchy eggs

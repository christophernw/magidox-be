Very logical question! From my studying, I think you'll find many of the comments already made are correct Biblically:. 1. Only Christ can forgive sins. 2. There is no need for a priest to take your confession to God (Hebrews 4:14   Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession.  .   4:15   For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.  .   4:16   Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. ). . The only way you are required to confess to a priest is if you believe that the Catholic church is above the Bible, because the Bible does not require it; only the church.

It isn't just SE england where all this incessant house building is happening, in Scotland every scrap of spare land suddenly becomes a Persimmon or a Barratt housing estate, it not only uses up more water, it makes already inadequate transport infrastructures even worse, it puts another 1000 people in your area which you didn't want and quite frankly I would sooner have a field and trees to look at than a bunch of poorly constructed identical boxes. So if this is happening here in Scptland, and its bad news, then its catastrophic down there, but you have got to remember, town planners don't have a clue what they are doing, they put money before people.

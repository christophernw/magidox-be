Hey man,. . Wake up....If you think We have real poor people here in America....You need to go visit a 3rd world country. The money spent on the military here in the U.S. is vital to keep the country free and virtually poor free. 3rd world nations don't have welfare programs...the poor there die........DIE.... they don't have anything like the poor have here.....Please....before you start bashing military spending do a little research...... or go to a third world country....it will open your eyes on how "lucky" poor people here in the U.S. really are.

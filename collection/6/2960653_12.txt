How and why are you comparing Liberals to Christians? One is a political reference and one is a religious reference. The comparison would be Liberal to Conservative and Christian to Non-Christian. .   Believe it or not, there are Liberal Christians. The nativity scene displayed in my house helps to remind me of what the glorious season of Christmas is. But do I think that people that don't share my beliefs should be forced to look at nativity scenes everywhere they go? Nope!

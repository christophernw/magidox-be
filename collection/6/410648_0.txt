if you're a female human, you're born with all the eggs you'll ever have already made.. . they arrest in meiosis ii, and as eggs mature, they complete meiosis. the longer they're arrested in that state (aka the older you are when the egg finally matures), the higher the chance that chromosome separation will not occur properly.

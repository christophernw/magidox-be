She was the most Christian and perfect woman I've ever met. I could give you her biography, but I'll just say she made a lot of sacrifices for her family.. . I wish I had her faith. Sadly, her funeral (two years ago) was the last time I was ever in church, and since then I have become more agnostic than anything.

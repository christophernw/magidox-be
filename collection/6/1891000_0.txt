Eh, this is why I never used glue traps after catching my first mouse and realizing that the mouse was still very much alive.. . Please call a vet and see if there is a bird sanctuary or wildlife rescue operation that can help.  Birds have a very high metabolism and they can die very quickly without the proper treatment.

European history before the 18th century is marked by warfare between states, and uprisings by the masses that rarely result in a change of type of government.  Just a matter of shuffling kings or queens.  However, after the American and French revolutions, Europe was rocked with one revolution after another by peoples demanding a new type of government, which has lasted all the way to World War II.  While there has been similiar "popular revolts" for new types of government elsewhere, the revolutions has had its most profound impact on European history in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Hallucination is a sensory perception in the absence of stimulus.Many epileptics experience it before an attack.They hear a sound without anyone making it.They may see some lights and so on.The type of "Aura"refers to the place in brain whence the attack is excited.Auditory hallucinations coupled with insomnia are the earliest "alerts"of schizophrenia.An occassional hallucination occurs in perfectly normal individuals.

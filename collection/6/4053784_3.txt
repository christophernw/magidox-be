There are two major elevator designs in common use today: hydraulic elevators and roped elevators.. . Hydraulic elevator systems lift a car using a hydraulic ram, a fluid-driven piston mounted inside a cylinder. The hydraulic system has three parts: A tank, a pump, and a valve between the cylinder and the reservoir.. . The pump forces fluid from the tank into a pipe leading to the cylinder. When the valve is opened, the pressurized fluid will take the path of least resistance and return to the fluid reservoir. But when the valve is closed, the pressurized fluid has nowhere to go except into the cylinder. As the fluid collects in the cylinder, it pushes the piston up, lifting the elevator car. . . Nowadays people are using roped type Machine Roomless (MRL) Elevator to replace the hydraulic elevator. The basic concept of applying hydraulic elevator is because of the building does not require overhead machine room on top of the hoistway shaft. However, it requires a separate room, normally located at basement next to the elevator shaft, to keep the tank, pump and control panel. The speed of hydraulic elevator is very slow as slow as 0.2m/s and maximum upto 1.0m/s (60mpm). . However, roped type MRL elevator has more advantages than hydraulic elevator system. The MRL design has eliminated the overhead machine room requirement. In addition, no additional room required for installing the tank, pump and control panel. All equipments are installed within the hoistway shaft. And, the loading capacity can reach to 2000kg with speed up to 1.75m/s (or 105mpm); from minimum shaft of 1500mm width by 1500mm depth.. . There are many companies supplying MRL elevators; the major companies are:-. Mitsubishi - ELENESSA. Hitachi - UAG. Schindler - EURO. Kone - Monospace. Thyssen - ISIS. FUJI - MCB-V3

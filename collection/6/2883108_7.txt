There are three things to check.  As everyone else has said the ribs.  There is a difference in overweight and obese: overweight - you can't see the ribs but you can feel them; obese - you can't see or easily feel the ribs.  Second is abdominal tuck.  If your dog stands and you look from the side, does s/he have an obvious, even (flat tummy), or sagged abdominal tuck?  If it is sagged, s/he is obese.  The last is with your dog still standing, when you look down can you see any waist definition in front of the hips?  If not, it really is time to start monitoring portions and thinking about a diet food!

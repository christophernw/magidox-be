a buddha is any being who has become fully awakened (enlightened), has permanently overcome greed, hate, and ignorance, and has achieved complete liberation from suffering. Enlightenment (or nirvana) is the highest form of happiness. The name Buddha is commonly used to refer to Siddhartha Gautama (Pali: Siddhattha Gautama), the historical founder of Buddhism. Buddha literally means "awakened" or "that which has become aware". Hope this helps u out hun.....Flo

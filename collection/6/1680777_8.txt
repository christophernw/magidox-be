Hmmmm so the old British women could hear your accent even though she was on the other side of the enclosure from you and you did not communicate with her .. Sounds like there's a racist here but it aint the imaginery old lady with crooked teeth.. How did you manage to get such a good look at her teeth anyway if you were  on opposite sides of the otter enclosure ??????. If you are gonna lie mate better think your story out a little better next time you stupid foriegner . Oops sorry did I let my rabid xenophobia slip out there

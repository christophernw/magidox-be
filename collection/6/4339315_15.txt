ok heres my take on this #`1 if you want to witness christianity try a homeless shelter, if you want hipocracy go to church. #2 i was raised southern baptist  and i was asked once what the difference was between a lutheran and a baptist.... my answer a lutheran will speak to you in the liquor store instead of hide. the beast has been said to have seven heads ponder this.. catholicism was the only form of religion for thousands of years and then your main seven denominations divided off from there.... so it may be safe to say that our founding religion was the beast for which all religion comes from...theres a fine line between a cult and a congregation. who is to judge other than GOD himself which one should we follow not all cults are extremist.. the press only shows us the bad and not the good, and trust me when i say this you cant have good without bad and visa-versa, and i wish you the best of luck on your quest...

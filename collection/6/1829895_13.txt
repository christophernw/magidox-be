Myer's Rum and Coke.  Myer's is a spiced Jamaican rum that has a very good flavor of its own.  If you like coke, (or pepsi or diet coke or whatever), you should also like this.  Make sure it's Myer's though, different rums all have different flavors and Myer's is the best for this.. . Another that you can try is a Long Island Iced Tea.  But these have a lot of alcohol, so be careful if you're not used to it!

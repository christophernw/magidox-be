Stop listening to the junk science you stupid tree-hugging idiots..... . The Antarctic Ozone Hole closed by mid-November which is early compared to the long term average closure date in mid-December. Since the middle of September, the depth and area of the hole had been close to average despite a relatively early start to the depletion (values for August were similar to those in 2003).

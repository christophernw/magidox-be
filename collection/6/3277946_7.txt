Not all fat is "bad" & nuts also provide proteins along with their natural oils (the fat part), both useful for effective energy needs. But, same as anything...eat a whole jar of peanuts--not so good..eat a handful of almonds--not so bad...moderation is key--using the bod, essential--balance of diet materials, just plain healthful. By the way, as far as nuts go...raw is best...heat destroys/changes many nutrients & alters absorption capabilities.

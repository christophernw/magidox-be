I think there are alot of homosexuals in the Philippines but due to the strict catholic upbringing of families, some or maybe most of them stay in the closet... Filipinos do tend to get excited with the liberal idealism of America so thus when they get there, people who are gay just come out coz perhaps no one cares if you're gay or not in the States unlike in the Philippines, there's always tsismis (gossip) esp. among family members, relatives, co-workers, friends, etc. You know how it is, once news of someone they know is gay, everybody talks abt them non-stop.

Possible causes of a low sperm count:. . 1. Infected semen can be a cause of infertility. Your doctor can test for this. It was previously thought that mumps could cause sterility in men but in fact it is now known to be extremely rare for mumps to lead to sterility. . . 2. Heat can reduce sperm production. This is why the testicles are outside the body in the scrotum rather than in the abdomen like the ovaries. Medical opinion is divided on how important the following are but we would suggest you take account of whether they might apply to you - Some men soak themselves in a bathtub full of scalding water, some obese (overweight) men can become sterile because the sagging layers of fat can overheat the testicles, some men whose jobs involve long hours of sitting may also have a reduced sperm count because of overheated testicles. . . 3. Very frequent intercourse can lead to a dramatic reduction in sperm count and cause the man to be effectively infertile. If you ejaculate as much as 2-3 times a day you are likely to have a problem. If you want to be at your most fertile you have to wait at least 3 days between each ejaculation! . . 4. Smoking over 20 cigarettes a day has been shown to reduce both the sperm count and the sperm motility. So stop smoking or reduce it to minimal levels!  . . 5. Excessive alcohol intake can lead to low sperm counts for a variety of reasons. . . 6. The workaholic man can find that fatigue can have similar effects on his interest in intercourse as well as stimulate a desire for excessive alcohol intake.

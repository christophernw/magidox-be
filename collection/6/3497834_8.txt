well, it all depends on what you believe heaven is, if you believe in it, and what your belief system teaches.. . If you belong to a religion, follow it's laws or teachings.. . In general, just don't do anything you morally oppose, and try to live life with as much integrity, honor, joy, and vivaciousness as you can.. . . Even though we have no idea what happens after this life, if we live this life the best we can that's probably good enough for now, and it will maybe even let us experience "heaven on earth".

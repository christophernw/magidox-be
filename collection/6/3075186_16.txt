Evil is a strong word. I don't believe most people have evil in them.  How to distinguish right from wrong? Most people know in their gut & simply choose to ignore it for one reason or another. It is human nature to sin. Read the Bible...or whatever book may be apart of your religion. No matter your religion, they all say the same thing basically as far as that goes.

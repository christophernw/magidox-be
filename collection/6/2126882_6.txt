It depends on the state you are taliking about.  If Missouri  It to me is absolute idiotic.  It says that it will ban cloning.  That is a lie.  They call the ban on just an implanted into a uterus.  The adult stem cell already has over 80 treatments at this time.  The embryonic has actually given tumors.  God is trying to tell us something.. I am praying that it will be defeated.  Alsoif passed they can take all state money away for there research and nothing could ever be done about it.  This is like the things Hitler did.  Does anyone want that.

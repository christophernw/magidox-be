In only the strictest definition is CO2 not a pollutant.  The fact that it's naturally occurring & that it doesn't have a direct effect on human health may be loopholes for CO2 not to be considered a "pollutant", which is defined as “a harmful chemical or waste material discharged into the water or atmosphere.”. . However, the vast, vast majority of scientists have accepted that increased CO2 emissions (caused by the burning of fossil fuels) have contributed significantly to greenhouse gases & to global warming.  So is it a pollutant?  No.  But should we be very concerned about CO2 emissions?  Yes.

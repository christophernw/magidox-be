You are entitled to your opinion as misinformed as it might be. . . I'm all for giving up our status as the "world power" if it means we don't have to babysit the rest of the world anymore. . . As far as being "warmongers" goes: You need to read up on your history because there are many countries that have tried to take over the earth at some point with the exception of America. . . ENGLAND, FRANCE, ITALY, GERMANY, JAPAN, and many more.. . Believe me, we don't want to own or control everything, but if we did, we would. . . And no, I'm not bothered. . . Everyone deserves freedom and if you don't agree with that then you have nothing to say worth listening to.

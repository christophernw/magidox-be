hey open your eyes my friend.... .  first, moslims do not justify killing others and according to there book it is totally forbidden to kill others only in case of wars or some major crimes as it is the case allover the world ( one can be sentenced to death if he committ a major crime).. .  yet, browse up, most killing that happend in this world was a non moslim case, look at the first and the second wrold war with more than 50 million killed, look at the vietnamese war, look at the colonial period, look at the discovery of the new world ( north america) with eliminated 25 million of the natives and the list is infinite Sir.... .   be wise and filter your prejiduces first then post it.

The Fascia the person is asking about is the symbolic axe held in a bundle of grain. This was the ancient symbol of Roman democracy, and is used by the American government for obvious reasons; as Newt Gingrich often has said, our Constitution is based largely on Roman, rather than Greek democracy.. . Mussolini, when he seized power in Italy in 1922, used the Fascia as a symbol of the rebirth of the Roman Empire (which destroyed Roman democracy) just as Hitler used and perverted the Swastika, which was an ancient symbol for goodness, purity and power in many cultures around the world.

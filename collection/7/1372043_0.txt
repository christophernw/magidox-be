Like yin & yang, chaos & order, and darkness & light, apples and oranges are what binds our world together.  So if we start comparing apples & oranges we're liable to find answers that would destroy the fabric of space and time...and none of us wants that.  Well, perhaps the writers of bad sci-fi shows would, but they rarely eat fruit, so I don't think it'll be too much of problem.

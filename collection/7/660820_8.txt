to make sure that I am doing something interesting and not something that I got to do just to stay healthy. If I dont like jogging then maybe i will like swimming? if not, then maybe basketball? just as long as i do something that will grow in me everyday and can make it a part of my life as a hobby or an interest rather than just something I HAVE to do just to reach somewhere

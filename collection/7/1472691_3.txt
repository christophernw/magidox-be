Ignoring or running isn't strong--it's just avoidance--and that will always come back to bite you. Whatever it is has to be processed and dealt with--that's strength.  Crying is just an emotional outlet and hasn't anything to do with being weak or strong. Both kinds of people cry. Strong people meet their problems head on and solve them and go on about their lives.  Weak people wallow in them forever and live with a victim mentality. Being numb is doing nothing--like being in limbo. It's ignoring whatever it is and never dealing with it.

the swelling could be caused by any number of medical conditions, but the most common causes are either pinkeye(conjuctivitis) or having a sty on your eye. If your eye is red and matted together when you wake up, this could be pinkeye. If this is the case you need to contact your doctor and have it checked out. If it is a sty, there is really not much you can do, except put warm compresses on it.

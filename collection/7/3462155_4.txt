MANY MANY things cause headaches.  It could be anything; diet, dehydration, trauma, illness, fever, eye strain, allergies, etc.  You have to know what's causing it before you can prevent them.  . . For a temporary solution, my neurologist recommends Aleve (or any Naproxin - generic is OK) because it's unlikely to cause "rebound" headaches or migraines the way Tylenol (Acetaminophen), Anacin (Aspirin), or Advil (Ibuprofen) are.

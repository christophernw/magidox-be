Well in Canada we have no damn rights anymore.  I live in Toronto, and you cannot smoke in a bar or basically anywhere, but yet all these non-smokers bitch and complain about us damaging the enviroment, yet these hyporcites pollute my air with their cars...,.I dont drive........ . . SMOKERS NEED TO FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS.  And why is everyone on here slagging smokers calling us losers....they are the idiots.....

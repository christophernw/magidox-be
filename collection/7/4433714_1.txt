I agree, coat the fruit in a flour, sugar, and spice mixture. This is the same way you would coat meat chunks to make a stew instead of a soup.. . Couple things to remember, you may want to use less sugar (a solid at room temperature, it liquefies with heat). And choosing the right fruit. I don't know if peaches are like apples with so many different types but if you can get one that is a little less sweet and more tart, and any variety before it is very very ripe, the fruit will hold up better and release less sugar. To get the sweetness you desire without having melted sugar throwing of the consistency of the cobbler, remember that tart fruits often sweeten up from baking so less may be enough. You can also make a crumble topping such as for muffins or apple crisp (oatmeal, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, cut into cold butter until it is pea size clumps then dobble on top of the biscuit blops instead of directly on the fruit, the crust will absorb any moisture.) OR you can add sweetner to the biscuit mixture.

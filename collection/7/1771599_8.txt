Most people and dictionaries probably define racism as discriminating or othertwise treating people badly on the basis on their skin. This is true, but racism is really just treating people differently on the basis of their skin. This could be a prefernce, or just a 'seperate but equal' deal, only actually equal. Either way, racism should be/is also defined as generally being without merit.

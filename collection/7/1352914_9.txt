Well lets see here, it is the smokers body and it is enjoyable. smoking is very addictive, more than heroin. But most smokers did not know how addictive or the dangers until recently.. Smokers pay a hefty TAX on cigarettes. If there was a sure way to get rid of the addiction most smokers have,( as everyone is different) I sure most smokers would quit.But then the GOVERNMENT wouldn't get all of those TAX DOLLARS from the cigs , so you can bet there WON'T be a treatment..  O.K. as far as pollution, look at the whole picture from factories, to chemical plants, power plants, and vehicles, the list goes on and on. As far as the litter I see used condoms, used needles , fast food packaging, pop cans beer cans, dead animals, broken furniture, big bags of trash, you name it, even a shoe here and there, BUT I CAN'T FIND ANY MONEY.. And you can not say all smokers are filthy pigs as most do put their butts in an ash tray and the pack in the trash. THE PROBLEM AS YOU CAN SEE IS SOME PEOPLE NOT ALL

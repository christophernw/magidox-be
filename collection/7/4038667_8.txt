Domesticated cats are only the smaller version of those seen in the wild... the reaction to attack is animal instinct. They too want to prowl and hunt, it's a million years of instinct and won't go away. My advice is to put water in a spray bottle to train him/her not to attack for fear of getting sprayed.

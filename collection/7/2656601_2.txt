My male cat has the same problem - he looks thin from above, but when viewed from the side, he's a tank.  Some cats (male and female alike) store their fat there.  Overweight cats are prone to health problems, so it's important that you work to get some of that extra weight off of him.  Switching your cat to a diet cat food is a great start, and measuring their food will help you to closer moniter his calorie intake.  Cat treats are VERY fatty and high in fat, so if you're feeding those excessively, cutting them out would really help.  Try stimulating him more with toys, helping him to move around and play more in an effort to burn some fat.  I know it can be tough - Good luck!

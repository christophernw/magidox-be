baptism is an act of obedience after being born again, aka becoming a Christian (follower of Christ). Some believe that baptism is what gets you to heaven. they are incorrect, it is believing that Jesus Christ died for your sins. Baptism is the first act of obedience demonstrating the washing away of your sins through the blood of Christ. Christ was baptized by John the Baptist.

You should keep him and have him neutered. Just don't put him down. Actually, most veternarians and humane society officials will not put a healthy cat down. The only time they will is if the cat is hurt or too aggressive. So I don't think putting him down is even an option. Adopt him and love him. For terrific cat names go to greatcatnames.com.

The water thing helps...but the trick is to stagger your alcohol and water intake.  I know it sounds tuff...but try to drink a glass of water to every 2-3 beers.  A full glass!!!!  If you are drinking booze instead of beer its not as necessary so maybe like every 3-4.  Your peeing will increase a lot but it will totally help the next day.. . Caffeine, drugs and sleep do not do anything.  Headaches pains from dehydration, and dehydration's comes from having too much Alcohol in your blood stream.

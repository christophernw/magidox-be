(Must be asked sorry!). . Are you exercising/dieting so much that your body is going into starvation mode? (It hoards the weight in anticipation of leaner times) Talk to a specialist. You might need to eat at different times of the day or different amounts.. . Have you had an allergy test lately? An allergic reaction to soy products caused me to gain 40lbs in two months while I was exercising and dieting. You might have something similar.. . Are you doing the right types of exercising? You might be building musle mass. . . Hope this helps.

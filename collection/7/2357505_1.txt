It comes from the abbreviation of the United States. (Uncle Sam). It started with the posters of the man with the patriotic top hat saying "Uncle Sam Wants You", in the military..Or, the U.S. wants you. We pay the IRS or the Internal Revenue Service, our taxes when not enough has been taken out through the year. Our taxes pay for education, public assistance, subsidized housing, Medicaid and Medicare, salaries for our government officials and many other things we, as citizens have here in our country. So, I wouldn't say Uncle Sam didn't do a dam* thing to get that money. If we didn't have to pay so much for people who never paid into the system, our taxes wouldn't be so high. You can thank the illegal immigrants for a lot of your taxes you pay out. Of course, there are other things that our government spends our tax dollars on that they shouldn't, like the Iraqi War, grants that don't amount anything but gross spending, subsidizing big corporations,etc. Here is what the illegal immigrants cost you:. . Illegal immigration is against the LAW. Legal immigration is OKAY. We would be SAVING tax dollars by sending them back. Here's what they cost us (the USA) ANNUALLY:. . Education: $22.5 billion .

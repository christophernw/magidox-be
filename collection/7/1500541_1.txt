The cross in not a symbol, it was a real thing that Jesus died on. It is Catholic teaching that developed it as a symbol and icon, the Bible has always taught that "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image of anything that is in heaven above or on earth beneath." (One of the Ten Commandments)  Many protestant denominations do not use crosses at all.

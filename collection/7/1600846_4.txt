I have four chihuahua's  if they misbehave I lay them on theie backs and hold them down untill they turn their heads side ways and drop their paws and relax I don't use treats to train them but I make them sit to give them treats they get alot of good dogs and praise be consistant they are very smart dogs and very loyal

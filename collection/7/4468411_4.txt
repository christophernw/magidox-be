Well obviously her education does matter to you. right?. I've been there.. and didn't worked for me.. just think about those days that you have to sit down and talk to her about hmmmmmmm......, NOTHING. you take her to hang out with your college friends..she is... again has nothing to say.. you bring her to meet your family, and again she has nothing to say.. Unless you really like her and don't mind explaining simple stuff to her.

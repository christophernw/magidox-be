hi. Go to MFA store or somewhere that they carry horse wormer.. There is a product that is a paste and is apple flavored that you can use on dogs with no problems. It gets rid of all variaties of worms. Including tapes.. It used to be called STrongid, but I think it has changed names.. I have used this for many years on all of my dogs, it works and it is inexpensive. . Depending on the weight of your dog, it will tell on the package how to measure by weight, you will have to do a little math but it is just as good as what you get at the vets and pay twice as much for.. . I too have been vet tech and worked for many vets over the years. I learned this from a vet in fact.. . Then after you get rid of them, you need to keep your dog flea free, use advantage or any other product that will keep the fleas off.

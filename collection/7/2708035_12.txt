hahah aoh please sithviolet.. what garbage... its not like that at all.. get your facts right. . i agree wwith imparicial.. basically in the muslim societies they know what the punishment is if they do something bad, which minimises crime... face it.. if it were like that in western countries... they would have a much better place instead of all this crap that goes on. Now i am not saying the muslim society is perfect.. i guess no one is perfect and every society has its weirdos.. just.. its not as much as the westerners :)

An LCD display is not affected by magnetic fields in the same way a CRT display would be. Degaussing would likely have no effect on the screen and would not solve the problem.. . Any color distortion that an LCD screen shows would be due to some sort of heat damage or some kind of physical damage (i.e. pressure or bending.) If there is some other sort of image distortion then the screen maybe damaged in some other way. It is very likely that any repair costs associated would be much greater than the value of the unit and would be much cheaper to buy a whole new unit.. . Since I have no idea how the "display is not correct," I really can't tell what is wrong with it.

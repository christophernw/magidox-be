Those are all good ideas........  I usually melt the butter before I start and plan to refrigerate the dough for about an hour to firm it back up... that seems to help.  I use NO white sugar in my cookies.  All brown sugar makes them really chewy. I also saw something about using whole wheat flour to make them softer.  .  I have used sour cream before too.. It's good. . I Always use a tollhouse recipe no matter what changes I'm making.

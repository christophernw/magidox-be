Depends where the head gasket leak is. If the leak is between the water gallery and the cylinder, it won't fix it.   If the leak is between the water gallery and the oil gallery, or the head gasket is visibly losing water externally, then it might fix it.  For how long it stays fixed - not sure.   I once used a liquid sealer to fix a hairline crack in the water jacket of an engine block.  That was 5 years ago and it hasn't leaked since.

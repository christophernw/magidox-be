I think you question is skewed what lies are you talking about  we invaded Iraq with all the same info Congress Kerry, Clinton the UN saw and agreed with, so as far as the lie I don't get it. We have lower taxes.  We don't have smaller government or less spending but we all know the democrats would love to spend even more, as far as scandals are concern both parties have them the big difference when there is a hint of scandal Republicans resign (ex Foley, Delay, Livingston) when democrats are involve in scandal they refuse to leave until voted out (Clinton,all the Kennedy's Senator Byrd ex KKK wizard) yes there is a double standard unfortunately it is the democrats that always seem to get a pass on things that would finish most Republicans. I can debate any democrat anytime any place they are easy because all you have to do is lay out facts.

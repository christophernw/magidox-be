All you really need to do in any given moment is decide whether to be Loving OR Non-Loving. If you are non-loving to another then you will draw karma to yourself which you will have to deal with at some later time. But if your intentions are to do the best by everyone all the time (including yourself), then you will have an amazing life.. . There are certain rules in place called Universal Laws which you may like to do a search for on The Web if that interests you.. . And if you really want to change your life, then search for a guru (an enlightened person) who can guide you back to God (God = Unconditional Love).. . Everyone is moving back to God, some at a fast pace, some at a very slow pace (lots of karma to deal with -> life lessons). Most people generally are in-between.. . So (simply), search for God and you will find God.. . That's it. Hope you find an amazing life for yourself.. . Namaste.. . ===. . P.S.. . If you are not sure what "Namaste" means then look up Wikipedia (online encyclopedia) for it.. . http://en.wikipedia.org

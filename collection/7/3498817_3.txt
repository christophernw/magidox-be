I had to tell a flatmate overseas the same thing. I had to explain the difference between deodorants & anti perspirants; between deodorant soaps & regular soaps. Be direct; gentle. Take them aside where you are alone & nobody can hear you. Explain that it will make her more professional to appear neat & clean. And a few days after the speech...if she's made progress, commend her. Let her know she's doing well.

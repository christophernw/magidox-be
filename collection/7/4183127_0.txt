It's like we're of two minds when it comes to sex.  On the one hand, we see nudity and the human form as "dirty" and equate it with sex, worry that teaching our kids sex ed will corrupt them, and get offended when women breastfeed (however discreetly) in public.  On the other hand, we have a more than thriving porn industry and more sex offenders than we can handle.  I think if we had a more matter-of-fact mindset about human sexuality and didn't twist it into something nasty, then there would less of the nastiness.

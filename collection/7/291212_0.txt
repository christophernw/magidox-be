You need to contact the American Consulate closest to you in Australia.  They can give you information on obtaining a visa, the document that you will need to move to America.  If you obtain the visa, save up enough money for about 3 months of living expenses ($US10,000?), and move to the U.S.  That would give you enough time to find a job and housing.

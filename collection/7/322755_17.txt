Because, we are meant to be recycled.. . Earth, Life, and every resource we have, is part of a circle (yes, like the CIRCLE OF LIFE in Lion King). . we live, we evolve and propagate our species, and die, and make room for the next generation, and the next evolutionary step.. . we become food, giving energy and flesh to whoever and whatever comes after us.. . when you eat a steak, you are eating the flesh of an animal that ate the grass that grew from the remains of many things, probably a few humans at one point also, who became soil, as is the fate of all of us.  . . Its one giant sphere, made of trillions of intersecting "cycles"

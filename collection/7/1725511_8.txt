See the stock market of your country or read newspaper in which the details of different country's currency will be given. Like for example in todays stock market status 1 pound is 1.5 dollars then u can say that if you have 2 pounds then it will be 2 * 1.5 = 3 dollars. Or simplest way is to visit some currency websites or approach the foreign exchange. Same can be done for dollars to convert it into pounds.

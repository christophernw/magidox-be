I would seriously get some help (no joke intended) if you hurt yourself because of "confusion" which is a natural human feeling it could get out of hand very quickly.  Or at least find another way to deal with the problems.  When i get down on myself i either listen to music, or go for a jog. Just to get some alone time and clear my head

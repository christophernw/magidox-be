Ppl should try not to distract themselves and try and keep busy while eating.  You're already doing something - eating! Focus on that. Think about every bite and the way it taste.  That way, you won't overeat because you'll be paying attention to how much you're eating and feel when your stomach says that you're full.  Most times, ppl are doing something else like reading or surfing the net or watching tv and they dont realize how much food they've taken in and/or didn't appreciate it.

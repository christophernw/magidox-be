Bless the LORD, oh my soul and all that is within me, Praise His Holy Name..... Why not Bless Him by whom all things were made?. Why not Bless Him for all His goodness to mankind?. Why not Bless Him for giving His life for all mankind?. Why not Bless Him for just Who He is?. . How can we go one minute without Blessing Him?  . . Without Him, I would be nothing,. Without Him I'd surely fall.. Without Him I would be helpless,. But with Jesus, thank God, I'm saved... . How can we NOT praise Him?  We would be out of our minds!

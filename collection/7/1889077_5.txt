in all honesty - i truly believe its because that person has nothing better to do - no motivation - hasn't identified purpose in life and thus goes to mall in order to indulge into material satisfaction - you shouldn't just let something from the mall make you feel happy and satisfied - life is more important than that and its a pure indication of your requirement for immediate gratification rather than just enjoying the simple things in life - try contemplation on the creation of life and its purpose and the reasons of why we are here - you'll find the mall to be a mere distraction at that point

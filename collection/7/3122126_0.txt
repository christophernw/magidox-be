If you don't want to end the friendship, create space between the two of you. Don't hang out with her unless you have LOTS of energy to listen to her, and don't expect a whole lot of understanding from her. . Sometimes you have to accept the limitations of a friendship, and as long as you know she's not your "best friend of all time" you can just let her be the way she is and go get more friends so that you can have better conversations. . If you take more time for yourself and your own activities, you may have less resentment when you hang out with her, because you aren't sacrificing too much time listening to her drivel.

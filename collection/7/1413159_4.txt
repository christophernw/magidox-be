im sorry  you are feeling like that it must be awful. Belive it not talking to as amny people as you can about how you are felling helps, it gets it off your chest, and work through for yourself and find the answers you are looking for. Other people may feel this way too and in turn they may talk to you about thier prolems and feeling that you have helped (by listening) will lift your spirits. You will be fine.

Genesis 11 : 1-9...And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime for mortar.  And they said, Go to , let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven...vs. 7 (the Lord speaking) Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. ...vs. 9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel ( pronounced babble ) because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth... In simple words, The people thought they didn't need God and could get to heaven on their own, but God confused their languages to show His control and power.

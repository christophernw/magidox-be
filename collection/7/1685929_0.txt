I asked a question similiar to this last week.  Basically, if you ask a question and someone responds with "2 points" and nothing else, it means that they are just answering to get two points to add to their score.  It apparently falls under the hideous infraction of "gaming for points", which means that you can report their snarky @sses if you so desire!  Muhahahahha

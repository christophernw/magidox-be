dear God....i so don't think one has anything to do with the other....i am neither liberal, republican, christian, or any other radical over the top nut job and I loathe the Christmas season.  i think it's become a commercial nightmare making it impossible to partake in my favorite pastime, shopping.  Christmas carols in the mall make me want to vomit and it drives me nuts to hear jews are offended when someone says merry christmas.  let's all get over ourselves shall we and try to get along....stop being so damn politically correct and get back to reality when things were simpler and remember what it's really about about....you know...peace on earth...goodwill toward men.....watch charlie brown's christmas or something or take a valium.

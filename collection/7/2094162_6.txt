If you would rather go out with her, tell her how you feel about your relationship.  It doesn't have to be either/or.  She doesn't need to know how much or little you like her, just that you have better things to do than to watch her dating habits, and let her know the type of men she's dealing with.  The best thing is to hook up with another female if you can, and if you still want to get involved with her, you now have something to fall back on without feeling rejection.  If you have a girlfriend, no need looking for another.

The old one can be ( stitch welded) with a special type of rod just for welding cast iron and engine blocks,I believe if I am not mistaken it is a nickle&steel rod for stick welding cast iron only .You can purchase the rods at welding supply shops all over, a little pricey.But they will do the job .If you still want to replace I would look for a marine salvage through any boat-livery and marina; someone should be able to help.Check your water pump you may need a new impeller(to crack a cooled exhaust manifold would mean lack of water flow),also check your rubber joint for cracks from heat between lower unit exhaust connection and manifold.. and as a suggestion for safety (in the event of a water pump failure and that rubber joint pipe fails on the exhaust keep a tennis ball on hand .it will fit nicely into the lower pipe connection in an emergency and prevent water from comming back into the boat from the lower unit and keep you afloat till help arrives.

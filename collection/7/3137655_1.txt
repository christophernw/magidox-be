Ok, get on-line in the correct state, after requesting form, it will come in the mail, fill out and do as they request, it will take a little while but you will get a check for that amount.  I had to send a copy of drivers Lic and gave my SS number.   Real simple if you mail all that back to them.. I filled out one form, sent in what they asked for, check came.

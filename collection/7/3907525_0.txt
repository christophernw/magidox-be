well its a tough question ...it depends if he wants to or not....it can be really hard but if he is determined the longer he stops for the eaiser it becomes. I think the best way is to realize that life will become better without it.. Having regular excercise can help...herbal teas (chamomile). and having something to work towards such as a work project or hobby. Also if he hangs out with people who also smoke it, it is really best to keep away from them for a bit.

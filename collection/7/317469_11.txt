Need more info, what have you tried already? Not saying you've tried anything leaves us with the impression you don't wash.. . Make sure you wash your face with products designed or oily skin. Avoid picking at your spots but if you can't help it make sure you wash your hands before and after and use something with antiseptic in it to stop your spots becoming infected.. If your skin is really bad then you may need to go to the doctors for a prescrition.

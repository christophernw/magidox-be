in localized area's rain may come in any direction.  But in reginal scale, rain generally comes from the west due to coriolis effect & the cold air coming down from higher lattitude.. . Also, when cold & warm air are mixing, cold air catches up the warm air from behind in counter-clockwise rotation, which produces rain / storm.

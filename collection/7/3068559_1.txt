Um.. . Chances are, if you're in America or a major Chinese city, people understand the English HELLO and GOODBYE.. . Proper Chinese pronounciation is pretty tricky.  Mandarin is a musical language--it's based on pitches--and any syllable can have dozens of meanings, depending on how it's 'sung'.  Saying 'zai jian' (goodbye) and 'ni hao' (hello) with the typical American flat accent may charm your friends, but you're not likely to get more than a tolerant smile from a more-distant person.  Your best bet is to find a Chinese person and ask, and listen closely to the pronounciation.

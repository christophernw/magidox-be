I don't read books anymore because I am busy writing non fiction books, but when I did it was to add to my knowledge.When you are doing a speech it is best that you mention the different types of books as your intro, but for the centre of the speech, it is best to focus on one type such as non fiction. for your closing section you can focus on self publishing and the famous writers who first started out as self published authors.

brits are brainwashed from infancy to regard royals as gods,ab ove the law and above criticism. Thats how they cling to power. Thats the result of their control of the brit social system - all critics get ostracized and if they dont lose their jobs, they never get a promotion. So singing those ridiculous things embellishes the god-like image that the royals use to perpetuate themselves in front of the hapless brits. Royals got one hand in every brits pocket, the other over every brits mouth. It works for them, real good.

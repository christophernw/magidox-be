place the turkey in the sink and leave COLD running water on it that way all the bacteria and germs go running down the drain ... if you leave it in a sink full of water you are setting yourself up for a night of tummy problems, there is nothing like leaving your turkey in a cesspool of nasty things! you can also leave the turkey to defrost in the fridge, just make sure it is on the bottom shelf!

Biologically, yes, its an established fact that humans are theoretically as far as we know animals.But its the very fact that we re asking this question to ourselves that perhaps distinguishes us from the "animals". Humans have gone far beyond any 'animal' that has existed on this planet in terms of technological advancements and in understanding the workings of nature and of life itself. Organs and bodily functions are not the only basis of classification.

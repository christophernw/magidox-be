I am a retired Navy guy (I served from 1972-1992) and an enlisted Marine is not called "sir" because he/she is not an officer. Only officers are greeted as sir/maam. There's typically no situation when a Marine (especially a senior enlisted) would be called "sir". And it could be potentially embarrasing if a Marine was greeted as sir and an officer was present.. I've made the mistake of greeting a Marine Sergeant Major as Sergeant and was reprimanded by my Department Head. Marines take great pride in being addressed by their enlisted rank. . I hope this answer helps.

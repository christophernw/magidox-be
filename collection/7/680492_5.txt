Thats happened to me before, i suggest it could be one of three things.. First,when I was in highschool, I played a sport and had practice, everyday, all year long. And from my feet being wet/dry/crammed in cleats or shoes/running/pounding.. it would happen continuously throughout highschool.. Also, your shoes could just be too small, causing the cumulitive effect of ur feet crammed in there can do that.. And finally, you may have some type of nail fungus, which . can cause toenails to fall off. If the nail looks discolored at all(yellow,offwhite,green or black) or ur nails are very thick- go see ur dr and they can recommend a good fungal cream, or pill prescription to get rid of it! good luck!!!

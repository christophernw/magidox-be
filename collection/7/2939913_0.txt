In the beginning God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.  How would it be natural for two men to have sex when they are made the same?  A woman is made with the things that complete the duo so they can become one and is fitted just right with no danger of disease if they are doing as they should be.  Only place to have any sex with another man is in the backside where there is disease and waste, not something that is so natural as you say it is.  It is not unnatural to have a bed unless you think we should just lay on the ground.  What is not natural about that?  Or the buildings as even when you look at the future in Heaven it says we will build houses and inhabit them.  Does not sound so unnatural to me.  now if you talk about two of the same sex trying to have sex with one another, that is not the natual thing and is an abomination.  The sin they are committing is the one that says it is wrong in God's eyes and should not be done.  If they don't care if they ever make it to Heaven, it it their decision but the bible is plain in that matter that there will be no homosexuals in Heaven.  Just the truth spoken.

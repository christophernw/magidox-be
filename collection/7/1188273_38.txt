for one thing, burning is the only approved way to properly dispose of a worn out, torn, faded, or otherwise defaced flag. it is done at a respectful ceremony, and is actually very touching. for another, flag burning as a political statement is just that: a statement. an expression of one's views. therefore, it is permissible under the first amendment. whether or not it should be done is another issue entirely.

I understand your question; and also understand why you think people might yell at you. Some can take these things very seriously. . . I didn't read the first two novels, but was constantly hearing on the news about people camping out, and going crazy over each new book in the series. Since I've never seen anyone go crazy with anticipation about a book before (a BOOK???) I thought I'd check it out. I read the third novel, and was totally enthralled.. . For me, what makes these books special is the author's ability to create a completely different universe that operates under its own rules, and yet, is totally normal and believable. These aren't fairytales; and that's what makes them so marvelous. The stories are told in such a way as to make you believe that this is a totally normal world with totally normal people who just also happen by the merest of circumstances to be magical. You see, the biggest difference is that fairytales attempt to play up the whole idea of the extraordinary. They revel in the "gee whiz" factor; and J.K. Rowling doesn't do this. she has the most incredible talent for presenting the most phenomenal alternate reality as though it's something we all know (or at least SHOULD know). And that's what makes her work so much fun. She creates a world that simply envelopes and absorbs the reader. . . The stories are richly textured and the characters wonderfully and fully humanized. And while each novel can be enjoyed seperately, there is additional enjoyment in knowing that each novel is contributing to the suspense of the ultimate clash between good and evil that will occur in the final novel. I can't wait.. . Hope this answer helps. Cheers, mate.

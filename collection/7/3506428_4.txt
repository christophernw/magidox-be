Oxygen gas is actually slightly blue in colour... because there is so much oxygen in the atmosphere then it appears blue, we can not see this blue colour with only a small amount of oxygen... a similar thong happens with water.. A glass of water has no colour... however the ocean is blue... the blue colour happens because there is lots of water... likewise the blue sky is because there is so much oxygen gas in it.. . The red colour is caused by light beding in the morning/evening and the red light bends more so that more red light reaches us than other forms of light.

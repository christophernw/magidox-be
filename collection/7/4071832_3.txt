Is the noise coming from inside the vehicle or outside, and if it's from outside where at? If it's from under the hood, you may be low on powersteering fluid, check your reservior, and put in the reccomended fluid, probably Dexron III transmission fluid. You may also have a loose drive belt, if it has more than one belt, determine which is the culprit, then tighten it. If you purchase a Nissan factory service manual, It will help with just about any wrenching you need to do to your vehicle, either inside or out.

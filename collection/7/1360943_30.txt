There is some global warming going on. It is due to green house gases(CO2). The state with the highest amount of CO2 gas emission is Alaska. This is due to the fact that Alaska, Canada and the northern countries have large amounts of Tundra. Tundra is a vegetation that takes in oxygen and gives of CO2.. Al Gore and other environmentalist don't point this out because it would mean spraying defoliant on large parts of Alaska and Canada. Talk about an inconvenient truth.. . Gore, the famed inventor of the Internet, goes around on a private jet presenting his side of global warming. The people who believe in Gore will see his movie and be impressed by it. Those that don't agree with him won't see his movie.. As for me I have too many problems of my own to worry about global warming

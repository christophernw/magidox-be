First of all your statement that all muslims are uptight is very wrong.  I know many relaxed, down- to- earth muslims...  It is my experience that prejudice is the mark of the unenlightened....and your traslation of the quran is not exactly accurate...Let me ask you ...are you really seeking knowledge or are you putting others down to make yourself feel justified?

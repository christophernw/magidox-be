Because there was a war beetween Moldova and Pridnestrovie (republic , not officially recognized by world , population - mostly Russian  , historical issue,I lived there for 2 years  ) . Moldova wants independence and in the same step wants to get down Pridnestrovie and colonialise while cooperating with Ukraniane goverment)  .Its very obvious that Russia will not tolerate this pressure  .

American Idol has never had a black winner?. I don't watch, so I don't know. The problem I have with this question is simple. Why is it that when ever a black person is fired, dismissed or what ever, there is always someone screaming racism? There is not a big bad bugger man behind every tree. STOP LOOKING FOR HIM!!

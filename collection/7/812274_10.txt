It's perfectly natural for her to prevent the male from coming around...protecting her pups is her main priority.. . The best that you can do for her is to keep her in a private area with fresh food and water nearby and clean bedding for her and her pups.  She wont require a whole lot of special treatment, but she will stress if she doesn't feel like they are safe, or if she has to go very far from them to eat and drink.

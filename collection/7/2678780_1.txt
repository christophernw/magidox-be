More than likely Delta will be the most convenient (and costly). The Cincinnati Airport (located in Northern KY) is the second largest Delta Hub behind Atlanta. (as of last I've seen). If you are looking for a more affordable airport choose the Dayton, OH airport. It is very convenient if you are traveling to the Northern Suburbs of Cincinnati. However, if price is not a factor choose the Cincinnati Airport, it is very clean and well maintained.

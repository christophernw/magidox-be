Hey there.. . My family is unfortunately plagued with such.  Depending on the severity of it, you can do one of the following:. . Cut it off or Laser it off.. . My dad had a long skin tag and showed it to the doctor.  The doctor put alcohol on it and then took a pair of scissors and cut it off.  I don't think it has grown back since.. . My mom and sister grows little skin tags on their neck, chest and back.  A doctor used a lazer treatment to burn those suckers off!. . Best of luck to you!

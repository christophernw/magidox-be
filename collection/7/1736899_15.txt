we cant just send everyone over there to fight, think of the administrative and logistical burden that would put no one on the pentagon but the american tax payer.  plus who would be here to defend the homeland if case of military invasion? local law enforcement are only meant for civil disorder and the guard would be included in the "full force" policy.. . anthony cruz, YN3, USN

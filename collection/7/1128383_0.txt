A crushed leaf smells like Fruit Loops cereal. So good. I don't think anyone has talked about anything but the leaves so : the bark of a sassafras is a reddish chocolate color with deep lines called fissures. Under the bark is a orange color and the oils (smells good) are there as well. The fruit is a blue drupe (looks like a berry)on a reddish pedicel (stalk). The new twigs are green.

The depo shot can really throw off your menstral system, I really don't recommend depo to ANYONE. It can have longterm harmfull side effects. I know myself from experience with the depo shot, it does different things to different people, but except to be off wack for a while, sometimes it can take 6 months to a year for your body to get back to normal from it.

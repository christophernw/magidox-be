EDIT:   Thanks for clarifying your position on your original question.   I appreciate it!  :-) . . Copied from my blog for one of the most popular atheist questions.  I am a spiritual atheist, hon.  :-)  I feel at home here.  I don't judge theists of all stripes or colors.  :-). . Why do atheists/agnostics hang out in the R/A section?  . . I, as only one spiritual atheist, am here to learn about the various religions, philosophies and spiritualities of the world.  I always held fascination with religions in general (not just christianity---ALL religions, old and new).   I do not seek a "god" belief, but here to seek how people attain inner-peace, self-knowledge, inner-wisdom and how they attain peace in their lives in general---and that I might learn a thing or two. :-)   I seek to find and improve on my own atheistic spirituality, to improve upon myself. Isn't that what spirituality is basically about? I believe so! . . I also hang out here NOT to "defeat religion" but mainly to give the "other side" of the equation, to give information, and to let others know that there are more than one valid way to see, learn and experience the world.   R/S section is not "just reserved for the theists". It is reserved for all. . . I have to disagree that being spiritual always REQUIRES a "god" belief.  What of the Buddhists or Taoists?  They are deeply spiritual, but lack a "god" belief of sorts.   The way I see it, spirituality focuses on the internal part of the person---their soul, their personality, their well-being.  Religion focuses more on the external (church, praying rituals, communion, confessionals, etc), and usually religion does require a belief in "god" or a supernatural entity of some sort. . .

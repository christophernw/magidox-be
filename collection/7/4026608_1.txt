the bubbles are eggs mine duse that all the time and i asked about it and i was told its just eggs..if you had a nother Beta you could breed them but you can only leave them in the same tank for a few mins and then take them out..if you have a girl Beta dont leave her in the same bowl as your eggs she'll kill them.

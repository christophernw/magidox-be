I think you really have to think about the long-lasting effects of what the person did to you.  It sounds like you were hurt very severely.  If so, you need to realize that the person who did this to you does not deserve your love, because he/she obviously does not love you.  I think you have to distance yourself from the person and take some time to assess the situation.

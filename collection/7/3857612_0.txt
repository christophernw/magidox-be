The second category of concussion, referred to as a complex, second degree or Grade Two or Three concussion, usually follows a brief loss of consciousness. Symptoms in this case usually last longer than fifteen minutes, or will return with physical exercise and exertion. Often, in the case of a complex concussion, the person has no recollection of the incident causing the injury. The first time a person experiences a complex concussion, the symptoms will generally disappear within a week. A person who experiences a complex concussion should see a doctor as soon as possible.

My religious foundations came with my birth into this world-.  my great-grandmother practised Judaism....she refered to herself as an ISRAELITE...not an Israeli or a Jew. She was born in the late 1880's....in AMERICA.. . My great-grandfather was a "Buffalo Soldier"...who adopted the way of life of his wife....a Native American of the BLACKFOOT NATION. His grandson..my FATHER, met my mother, who was following the religious rites of my grandmother.. . WHO AM I???...and what do I follow?. . "I hope you can imagine ...that you've journeyed with me...thru all the frozen,...un-real, un-natural lifestyle things...that we had to go thru...in order to get to a point...where WE can arrive...at a place. called EULYPIA"  I know where EULYPIA is.....Do you?. . I'm certain YOU know how to get there...PEACE and HEALTH to you...along the way.

Pretend to sleep, no matter what your cat does. This might require hiding most of your body under the covers, so the cat can't gently "prick" you with its claws to wake you up. It will take about a week (maybe more, depending on how long this has been going on) for your cat to get the message that you're not getting up in the middle of the night, no matter what.. . Leaving some food and water out is also a good idea, but the cat's probably not waking you up for food as much as it is waking you up for company.

I used to have platinum blonde hair and very often, people used to ask me, out of the blue, when we weren't even talking about origins, if I were Polish or Russian.  I speak ordinary english like every other Canadian but for some weird reason, strangers would say, "I'm usually pretty good at guessing a person's nationality.  You're from Poland, aren't you?". . NO!  I'm Canadian with Irish and Scottish roots!!!!!  . My hair is brown now.  :)

The left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood out through the aorta to the whole body.  The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs for oxygenation.. . So the left ventricle musculature SHOULD be thicker and stronger.  An irregular heartbeat or electrical signal in the left ventricle is MUCH MORE SERIOUS than the same malfunction of the right ventricle.

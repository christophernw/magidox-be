This is what I found:. . "An important part of the Ottoman warfare was also the Six Divisions of Cavalry (Altı Bölük), a mounted élite force. The most important of these divisions was the Spahis. A force of professional raiders called akıncıs pillaged enemy territory ahead of the regular army. They also served as scouts.". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_the_Ottoman_Empire. . Is it any help?

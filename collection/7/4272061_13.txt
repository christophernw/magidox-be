Like any big change, just prepare yourself the best you can and then take it one day the time.  The world is full of people who have graduated from high school.  You can too.  Find some trusted adults and have them give you a hand when you need it.  You'll be just fine, just keep your head about you.  (Besides some stuff about high school is actually fun!)

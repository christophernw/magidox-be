Your first step is to just GO a mile without stopping.  Run for a while (even if it is only a few seconds), then slow up but try not to stop.  It is much better to walk, even slowly, than to stop completely.   If you have to stop, it means that you ran too much to begin with.  Try again a few hours later or the next day, and run a shorter way before switching to walking.. . Go like that, run-walk-run-walk, until you can definitely go a mile without stopping.  Then, gradually, make your running portion a little longer each few days or each week.  DO NOT expect to be able to add more every day.  In fact, some backsliding is normal and to be expected.  You will just have days when you don't have much energy.  It happens, so don't be disappointed.. . If possible, try to end your run-walk-run mile with a running segment.  You are going to stop at the end, so just suck it up and run the last bit, even if it is only the last 100 feet.  It is easier to make yourself lengthen the last section than any other, because there is that immediate reward of being able to stop after the finish line.  So, if the first week you run the last 100 feet, increase it to the last 200 feet the next week, and so on. . . Running a mile is a good goal.  Just take it gradually and don't force yourself to do more than you can.  And of course, if you feel any unusual leg or chest pain, stop immediately.  But the system I described will work if you give it time and effort. Good luck!!

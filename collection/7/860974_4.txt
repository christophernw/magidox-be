The are two interesting things about this.. . This first is the most obvious of course, so that it looks like normal writing when you read it in the rearview mirror.. . The second is that it is also done in other languages in other places around the world.. For example, all through the Arabic-speaking world, one of the few places that you can see Arabic written backwards is on the front of an ambulance.

Its a bad habbit to get into. I use to be real bad at it. I would find myself making up excuses instead of just getting the work done. I've recognized the problem though and I've gotten a lot better. As far as promises go, sometimes its hard to know. I relize now that I would make promises just to make people happy. BIG MISTAKE. Those are the worst promises bacasue they are so hard to keep (and sometimes impossible). I take someone has made you angry by making lots of excuses?

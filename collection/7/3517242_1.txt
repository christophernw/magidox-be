I prefer to call it stuffing.  Dressing can mean either stuffing or a salad dressing to me.  That can get confusing when someone says they're making dressing.  I don't know whether they mean for salad or for the turkey!  So I prefer stuffing for the bread concoction whether or not it's in the turkey or on the side.  Eliminates confusion.

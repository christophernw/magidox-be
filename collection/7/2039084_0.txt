It is REALLY unlikely that an employer is going to check your credit history.  Even if they claim they have that right, or you give them that right when you fill out the application.. . There are plenty of other ways to get screwed when trying to find a job, this one should probably be at the bottom of your list of things to worry about.. . Good luck.

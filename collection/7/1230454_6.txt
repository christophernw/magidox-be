control over oil generally! as oil is the currency of economys, countries would collapse if the oil wasnt there hence they fight over it, but generally to keep people happy the leaders attackiong would come up some other reason as to why they are attacking(george bush). On the very rare occasion it is for a just cause in respect to humanity(war on hitler)

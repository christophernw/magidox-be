As was stated above, gravity is also a "theory."  People confuse the term "theory" with "hypothesis."  A theory is an idea that has been tested and repeated and verified.  . . If you choose to believe in God, why not believe that he had the knowledge and foresight to simply switch on the whole process of life - including evolution.

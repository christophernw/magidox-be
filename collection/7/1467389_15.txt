A c-section is short for Caesarian, this is when the vet will cut open the stomach near the uterus to remove the puppies. This should only happen if the dog has a history of birthing problems or is having on for the first time ( a problem).  Your dog will not get one during pregnancy unless there is a problem with one of the puppies, at all costs the vets will save the mother before the puppies. Chihuahua's and Chih. X will usually only have a problem when the mix is a larger breed of dog. Mosly anything other than another chihuahua. Talk to your vet...

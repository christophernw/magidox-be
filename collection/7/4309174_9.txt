there's no good reason for it. Just overgrown tribal crap, born of superstition and ignorance and buttheaded religious and political beliefs, that removes a shitload of sensitive nerve-loaded tissue and makes sex less enjoyable.. . Just like MALE circumsion. . . The fact that practice has gained widespread acceptance doesn't make it any less buttheaded. And I'm sick of hearing the hygiene stuff used as a justification for it.. . Anybody that can't figure out how to wash his dick shouldn't be trusted with one in the first place. That argument is about as valid as supporting the chopping off of babies' toes so they'll never have to worry about getting toecheese.

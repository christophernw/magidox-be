There are several reasons...oil? possibly. But the confilicts in Iraq have been continuing since the early 1990's. . . Saddam agreed to guidelines. He didn't stick to those guidlines. He was given several chances to comply. He failed to do so in accordance to the guidelines... And he showed no signs of willingness to comply in the future. He made it obvious.. . Unfortunately due to 9/11 the U.S government decided that the time for him to comply was well overdue...this indeed helped lead to this war...and it is my belief that WW3 may have actually began back in the early 90's.

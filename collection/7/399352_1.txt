II think the letters you are looking for are RMS: root mean square. The value you see on a voltmeter is the RMS value of the voltage, which is about 70% of the zero-to-peak voltage of the waveform.. . RMS can be calculated by taking the input voltage waveform, say a sine wave, squaring it (which makes all the voltages positive), taking the mean (average) voltage, and then taking the square root (to undo the value change from the squaring operation while leaving the value positive).

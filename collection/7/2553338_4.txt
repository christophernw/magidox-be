The best way to find a reputable doctor is by asking friends, neighbors or co-workers if they know of a good doctor.  Beyond that, if you have some names of doctors in your area you can look on the Board of Medical Examiners web site (below) for basic information about them.  You can also try the second website below to see if a particular doctor has had any malpractice suits against them.  . . Keep in mind your friend will need to see a doctor who is on her health insurance plan, or she will have to pay the full cost herself.  This can really limit your options.  Best of luck.  I hope that the CT scan has encouraging results.

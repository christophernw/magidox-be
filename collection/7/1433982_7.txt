Avonecharles, sort of like when you mention George Bush’s name.  I think Kim’s response relates as well.  The Democrats and media are hard at work trying to steal our souls.  Seriously, it is something I have responded to in other questions.  When people are opposed, or do not believe in something, they fire back with attacks.  They do not open their minds.  They can not respond with objective reasoning and intelligence.  Too bad.  I do believe this is a country founded on the belief of God and liberals and the ACLU are taking that all away from us.  You know what you believe in and God will always be there for all of us.

10% of hypertension has a secondary reason - hyperthyroidism, renal stenosis (constriction of the blood vessels feeding the kidneys), adrenal imbalance among others.. . 90% of hypertension is called essential.  We understand the multiple mechanisms that regulate the process but we do not understand the why.  Further we understand some of the things people do to make the situation worse - risk factors are lack of exercise, smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol, family history as well as increased salt intake which can exacerbate the situation in people who are salt sensitive.  . . Also we know that poorly controlled blood pressure is an independent risk factor for multiple other disease entities including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and others.. So it pays in the long run to take medication to control it.  It is not uncommon to require two or even three medications for optimal blood pressure control.  The idea is to address several of those known mechanisms at low doses achieving a synergistic effect while minimizing side effects.

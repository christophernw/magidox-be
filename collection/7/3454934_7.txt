The salt water is a good idea, also during the day you might try to take daytime nyquil or something related to that...I tried doing the alcohol (shots) once and ended up flushing the cold into my kidneys.  Not pleasant.  And they sell coughdrops with vit c in it also...also try some lozenges with zinc.

Okay this is ridiculous. I dont know what country you reside but as someone who lives in the United States and has travelled all over the world, there are fat and skinny people all over the world. Obesity is a world wide issue. American portions are larger. The difference is, in Britain and other Europen countries, you dont really have to go boxes. In America, we take everything to go. generally when eating at a resturaunt we are not only thinking of what we want to eat then but also what will be good warmed up later because we almost always take 1/2 our food home for later. . . Americans lazy? We are in a country that basically gives us no choice but to work to survive. Then in other countries where your insurance is paid for by the Government and they have loads of government housing where they dont pay a cent, we dont have those luxuries. All the Americans I know work there butts off. Lazy people are everywhere. People are everywhere. You cant generalize one nation as lazy. There are names for you as well - like closeminded. You clearly have no clue what you are saying.. . . Well now that just depends on where you get your facts. The United States is a large place filled with skinny and fat and in between people. I am sure that wherever you live has its share of all kinds of people as well. . . As far as facts - everyone knows that Obesity is a world wide epidemic.. its not just an American thing. . . You are clearly looking for a debate here or you wouldnt have singled out Americans. There are fat people everywhere. Also - fat does not equal lazy. Lots of issues can be attributed to obesity it is not always a lazy "American" thing.

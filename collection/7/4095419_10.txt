Get involved! Popularity is about how many people know who you are.  If you never put yourself out there than no one will find out how great you really are.  The secret in school is that even though everyone acts like they don't care - EVERYONE wants more friends but most people are just too shy to take the first step.  Join clubs, sports, student government,  whatever, just get involved and before you know it your social circle will expand.

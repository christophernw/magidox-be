Walk through first and then hold the door open; you may have to squish up against the wall, or if you're lucky, there is space behind the door... . . I did this alot for my dad who carried oxygen; it was hard at first, but now it's more like second nature.  I try to help other people who are assisting their aging parents with this little tricks to help them.  I don't expect a guy to hold open the door for me unless he's "Rico-Suave", but those types of guys scare me because they're too Suave.

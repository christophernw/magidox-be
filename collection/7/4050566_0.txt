Well..If you are hellbent on your views on a particular religion and not exactly ready to hear anything about it's negative sides(regardless ,wether it's in fiction or no) then you may as well put the book back on the shelf in that prettty li'l corner. If you dont mind it and want to hear something new or know how wonderful plots can be then you may as well read it. My rating 4 the book-***1/2.(by the way thats 3 n' a half stars)

A short allegory of Israel:. . Pretend that Israel is an apartment building.. . Some jews live there, some Arabs (Jordanians). Many empty nasty apartments.. . The Health Department says you Jews need a place to live. Take these places, fix them up, live here.. . Tired Jews move into vacant apartments, in spite of the hatred and attacks and murders by the Arabs (Jordanians).. Them fix up the apartments, live quietly, and protect themselves.. . Health Department comes by and says, good job, you can keep the apartments and the building itself.. . Jews now own the building. Arabs (Jordanians) say "Oh my God, they will murder and kill and rob and rape us simply because we murdered and killed and robbed and raped them, how unfair!!". . Arabs (Jordanians) run away leaving vacant apartments.. . Abandoned apartments become property of the landlords (Jews) and are turned over to other settlers who move in.. . Arabs (Jordanians) go to all other Arab countries and whine about reparations and poverty. Other Arab Countries kick them out.. . Arabs (Jordanians) decide that they need a new image.. . "Hey!!! We're Palestinizers now! Palestinites? Palestonians? Palesturgers??? (Gets out Liberal Arab Talking Points Crib notes) Oh! Palestineans! Right. These mean thoughtless cruel non burkah wearing Jews have DRIVEN us from our ancestral lands in Palestan. Wait!! Palestine. Boo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo (are the cameras still on me?) Hoo. We are peaceful people so murder them, rape their women, crush their children, blow up their weddings, funerals, cafe's, busses, wait - don't hurt the furniture, we'll need that!"

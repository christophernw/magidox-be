The gay community want the same thing that the blacks wanted the right to live in freedom! it is sad to think that this is 2006 and there is still hatred of people all because they are in love with a member of same sex.This country was built on freedom and the blacks and the gays are still not free! I feel that the gay rights movement and the civil rights are one and the same! WE ALL WANT CIVIL RIGHTS!

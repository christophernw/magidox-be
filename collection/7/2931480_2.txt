i tend to go to the back and get the american express travellers cheque in pound sterling (i am from england). they usually charge £1 per £100 you take out. then when abroad either go to a bank or use the reception in your hotel. then if you are lucky enough to have saved some money when yo return to the uk and cash in your cheques you will not lose a penny.

My suggestion would be to contact your local mental health community (listed in the yellow pages) and find out if there is some outpatient testing or therapist that will see and evaluate you. My sister is a borderline personality and my mother is a paranoid schizophrenic and both of these illnesses are very dipilitating. Recognizing that youneed testing is the first step.

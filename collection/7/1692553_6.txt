Sheep are stupid. I have raised sheep and I don't mind them, but they are incredibly stupid! They are naturally flocking animals and if you try to seperate them it is as if the world is coming to an end. But they don't eat down vegation for cattle. The best grazing system is actually having sheep and cattle because the sheep will eat what the cattle can't.

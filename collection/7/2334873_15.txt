Society greatly emphasizes sex, the "perfect body", and stuff like that, whereas education gets pushed to the side.  The number of people on here that know enough about the questions asked in the education section to answer them are relatively low to the number of people who, at least supposedly, know about sex and love. As people have said before me, this is unfortune and sad.

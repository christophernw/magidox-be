It blows my mind how you are still lumping all Christians together as if we are all drones without thought.  I am Catholic.  (yes Catholics are Christian)  I do not say anything bad about others beliefs.  I DO feel God loves all His children.  I hate no ones religion.  I respect the right for you to believe or not believe in what you want.  It is not up to me to judge you.  That's God's job.

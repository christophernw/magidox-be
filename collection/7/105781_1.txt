Tarnation is probably a blend of tarnal, which is a dialect pronunciation of eternal and which was used as a mild oath, and darnation, a euphemistic variant of damnation. ("Darn" itself is also a euphemism for "damn"; its origin is obscure.) Tarnation is originally and chiefly an Americanism. It is first attested in the late eighteenth century in New England.

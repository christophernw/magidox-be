buy her perfume, shampoo, and soap for her b-day, or stick it in her mailbox or school locker! Have ur mom write her a note (unsigned) and tell her ur a classmate and she smells and it would be her benefit to take a shower. (only reason ur mom would write it would be becuz that way she couldn't recognize the handwriting.) good luck!. . . to her: Happy Showering!

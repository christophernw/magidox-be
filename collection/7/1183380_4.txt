proficient means that you have enough knowledge of the language to get by, meaning you know the basics and can ask for directions, have a short conversation, etc. Being fluent means you can be totally emersed in a language and get by just fine. You can have extended conversations at a deeper level than if you were only "proficient". The next level is bilingual, but that is hard to attain.

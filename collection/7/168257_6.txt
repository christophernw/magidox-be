It stains your teeth--and it will get worse as the years of coffee drinking go on. Your breath smells. It's not good for your body to have a lot of caffeine. I have a friend who is addicted to coffee and cigarettes. She has stained teeth and gets major migrains if she misses a cup from her 2 plus pot average of coffee a day. I would say try not to drink it because you are so young...habits that form young are much harder to break and much more damaging. Try switching to tea that has some health benefits like green or black tea. Or alternate between coffee and tea. . If you just want to cut down you have to slowly ween yourself off of it. Like if you typically drink 5 cups a day cut one out the first few days or week...then cut one more out.. until you are down to where you want to be.

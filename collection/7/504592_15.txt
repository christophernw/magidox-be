Skin color is totally dependent on environment. Back when there wasn't travel between nations and all of the innovations we have today, the populations of each portion of the world adapted to their respective regions. Dark skin, light skin, dry skin, oily skin, and everything in between is a response from continual exposure by our ancestors to the weather and environment of each region of the world, to help the people in each area to adapt to their unique environment. Kinda interesting to think what we may become over time, since we integrate and travel so much now.

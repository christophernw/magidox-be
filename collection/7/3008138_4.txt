well start by being nice to her,it cant be easy for her to watch you thin and fit and her over weight. she must be eating out of depression. you can make it fun for her by suggesting a sister walk where you walk and talk,or join a gym together. be her moral support. doing it together will motivate her faster and the talking will make it fun and go by quicker. start making healthier food choices and ask your mom to only buy low-fat or cook with less fat,keep your sis involved as she will have less time to eat.I'm traing too be a personal trainer and know alot about fitness and weight-loss,so if you need anymore advice email me at ecstasyg83@yahoo.com. lol and best of luck to you.

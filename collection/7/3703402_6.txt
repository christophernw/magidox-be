To minimize the friction due to air. Compare it with shape of arrow. An arrow with reverse head will not travel fast. Compare it with the swimming competition. In most of the occasions of the swimming competition, the person swimming in the middle line has the chance of coming first because, the middle line will give less resistance to the swimmer than to the person swimming in the peripheral lines. Now come to the point. Mostly the first bird in a migrating group acts as guide to other younger birds (followers). This first (old) bird may have experience of searching its destination from its previous migrations. It is my assumption that the youger birds are following the old (experienced) birds on both the sides of it, so that the experienced bird remains in the mid of the migrating group. Due to above said reasons, the middle bird (experienced and old) takes the lead position in the 'v' shape and this also helps the old bird to show direction of the destination of the migrating group of birds. This is my assumption only.

Apart from everyone Else's recommendations for the enzymatic cleaner (which is true).  Cats (AND DOGS) can have problems with 2 little glands on either side of their butt -- Anal Glands.  Although it is less common with cats, they can become filled and get 'expressed' by the cat (usually when they poop - but may happen when they are excited, stressed, or if they are infected).  Anyway, this stuff stinks !!!  If the problem continues see your regular veterinarian.

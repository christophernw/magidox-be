The first christians did not "Join" a church, they were added on the day of pentecost when they asked "men and brethren what shall we do to be saved?" They were told to repent and be baptized and wash away their sins then they were ADDED to the church. The church [the called out, body of christ] is not a club or organization to join, God adds you to his family when you fulfull all his commandments; no matter what the mainstream denominations claim. You can't pick and choose what commands will or won't add you to the church. God makes the rules and we either choose to accept them or not [free will]. You can be added to the church any time of the day or night, any day of the week. It doesn't have to be on a Sunday. "Those who accepted his [Peters"] message and were baptized and were added to the church" ; "and the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved"[Acts 2:41]. Please speak to one of the leaders of the congregation you are planning to attend, they will be more than willing to guide you in this matter. I pray God will guide you in this decision.

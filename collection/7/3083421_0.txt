the banana is flat on the outside because it grows next to other bananas in the bunch and they flatten against each other.  The center stays round because the skin is protecting it.  In bananas that grow in smaller, more open type bunches, they are round on the outside (unless squished by the bag boy when he puts them at the bottom of the bag under 12 cans.... darn bag boy!)

Water flavored with lemon and light-colored hearbal tea are my favorites (I don't want to stain my teeth), but I am going to try flavored stevia drops that come in vanilla, rasberry, orange, lemon and others. Stevia is a natural sweetener that does not effect blood sugar levels and isn't an unnatural chemical, like saccharine or sucralose. You can buy it at health food stores, online, and even some supermarkets. . . My best tip is to drink water throughout the day and carry it with you. I know you've heard this before, but it is true that creating a schedule for yourself will help you accomplish the task. Take for example my routine:. . 12-16 oz. upon waking. Carry a 32 oz. bottle of water to work and drink before 10 am. . Have 12-16 oz of water around or with lunch. . Refill the 32 oz bottle and drink at work or carry home to finish that evening. . Drink 12-16 oz. before bed.. . Your personal water needs will be different, even day to day because when you eat foods with high water content, those count toward your daily total, too. Fruits and vegetables are mostly water, so they count. It also helps to drink filtered water, because it tastes better than most municipal water. . . Don't forget to drink more if you are exercising to replenish the water lost. As a motivational tip, drinking a lot of water will encourage your body to release any retained water, which it does when it thinks there may be a shortage, and it will fill you up. Don't be surprised if you lose a little weight.

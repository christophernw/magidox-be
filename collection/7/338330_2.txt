I assume you mean gender. If you are looking for a permanent solution, there isn't one. You can alter your physical appearance with a sex change operation which would include surgical procedures on your genitalia and/or breasts and hormone therapy correlating to which gender you are switching to, but your genetic make up would forever remain the same. If you are a female (46,XX) wanting to become a male (46,XY), your genetic analysis would remain female forever regardless of your new physical appearance. There are cases where humans have been born with something called "ambiguous genitalia" where they might have physical attributes of part male and part female and the "incorrect" choice was made in infancy, thus, the physical female is actually supposed to be a male (46,XY). The desire to undergo a sex change involves an identity question which you should certainly seek professional guidance about before making such a life-altering decision. Cytogenetic studies are also a guaranteed way to confirm your intended gender, which you should consider having as well. Also, remember that sexual preference and gender preference are two very different things. Try enjoying who you are before you make any change, and never be hesitant to discuss such personal issues with the right professionals knowledgeable in this area. By weighing the pros and cons in your situation, you'll be better equipped to make the right decision. Best of luck to you!

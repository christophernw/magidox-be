Parents who believe everything their kids say and who want to be their children's best friends instead of parents.  A parent's job is to raise an adult not s perpetual child who believes the world will continue to indulge them for the rest of their lives.  so many kids these days have not had to truly work out problems on their own nor have they experienced a real sense of self.  The parents hover and take care of any problems for them.  This is counter-productive.

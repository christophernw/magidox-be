I don't know much about the soil type in florida.  But it will be because of this.  Either it is generally too expensive to do or the construction methods do not lend themselves to basements.  In the UK (where I am from) about 100 years ago most houses had cellars (as we call them oer here) nowadays new houses virtually never have them.  It is more expensive to construct the property with a cellar than without one - Builders only really care about their profit margins!  I presume the demand isn't high enough for them to make it worth the builder going to the extra expense.. . The water table issue mentioned by others could be overcome but would just be more expensive again!!

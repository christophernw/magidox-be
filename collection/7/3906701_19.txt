Agnostic here,  they'll just point to some passage in the bible where it mentions a giant animal.. . You are trying to reason with someone who thinks there is a man in the sky with a long grey robe and a white beard who threw a fireball at the Earth because he didn't get his gay orgy invitation in time. Come on man, this stuff is all made up and its silly.

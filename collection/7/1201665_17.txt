We tend to think on direct terms of cause and effect.  God is of course brilliant.  He thinks millions or billions of steps in advance.  He thinks of the effects of the effects of the effects.  . Sure a direct cause of widespread homosexuality would be that the poplulation would dwindle to nothingness.  But that's not why I think the Bible says it's wrong.. . One reason is that it threatens the sanctity of family.  What about same sex parents?  That confuses (the child) about the quality differences between men and women.  Children need a father to be a father and a mother to be a mother.  Again, they need to understand what makes a man a man and a woman a woman. Parents influence the mind of a human being (during the formative years) more than any other person.. . (The subtleness of the Bible by the way is another proof that the Bible is divinely inspired.  Its genius is subtle.  We are obvious.)

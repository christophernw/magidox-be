Your Eustachian tube that goes from your ear to your sinuses is blocked, probably from blocked sinuses and if you blew your nose, definitely from blowing your nose.. . Cleaning your sinuses by sniffing light dose of salt water (saline solution - table salt and tap water is fine) may help. If painful, use less  salt. Turn head up and drip solution into nose. If you have some mucus movement in sinus, put saline in hand and try to sniff up.. . Afrin Nasal Spray or generic equivalent is widely available and the most effective decongestant with the least systemic impact to my knowledge. Pills, tablets, and capsules affect your whole body for one isolated problem. Meth (speed) is refined from one. over the counter decongestant and I'm not too impressed with the contraindications associated with the rest.. . For future reference on ear health. . 1) Never stick anything smaller than an elbow in your ear. Particularly applies to Q-tips.. 2) Vinegar or rubbing alcohol can dry wet ears but tilting head and waiting shortly before lightly banging works often.. 3) Wet ears can cause bacterial infection but infection is most likely when one closes one nostril and blows mucus out the other, and mucus up Eustachian tube.. * Never plug, block, pinch a nostril while blowing!! Great way to send bacteria from sinus into inner ear and cause potientially serious problems!!

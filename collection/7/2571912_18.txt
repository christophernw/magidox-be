As a coin has 2 sides, the probability of getting a head is 1 in 2.. . To work out the probability of two (or more) separate events both occurring, you multiply the probability of one by the other. . . 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4, so the probability of two heads is 1 in 4.. . In the same way you can work out the probability of 3 heads in a row as follows:. . 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8. . Just remember the keep multiplying probability of each individual occurrence.

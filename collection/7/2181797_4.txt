Its easy, absolutely NO talent is involved at all.  First you get a really popular book, like gone with the wind.  Then you hand write it page by page. (This next part is the only tricky part) Get ahold of a time machine, and go back in time. (If you can figure that part out, its all down hill from here) Submit the book two days before the ACTUAL author, and go back to your natural time.  Then go to the public patent office and show them your identity.  The interest alone will be enough to make you a millionaire, not to mention the price of the copyright that has been rolling over for a couple of hundred years.

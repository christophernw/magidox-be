You feel passionate about what you do.  That's it.  An artist is someone who takes the activity beyond the simple task of it.  A doctor can be an artist, a laborer can be an artist, a business man may be an artist, just like the poet, writer, singer, sculpter, and painters are.  So long as they cultivate their skill.  You know you are an artist because you feel something for your work, whatever it may be.

The problem is He said what He said, it was recorded and it looks as if He is calling the Soldiers dumb. It makes him seem elitist, especially since He was saying it at a college. Did He mean it? Absolutely not, but damage has been done. No one is going to listen to the three page reply he has made as all we get on TV news is two sentence reply. This is same mistake He made when running for President, going in complete detail instead of giving news bytes. He has probably helped Harold Ford loose TN  due to His remarks as many people are identifying all Democrats to His speech. He has also hurt all Democrats running in the South and border states, many of them have tried to distance themselves with His very liberal views but this will hurt them BAD. The irony of the whole thing is He did fight in Vietnam, He did get purple heart, He has helped get benefits for all Veterans, He does support giving the troops the funds for the materials they need to fight and Bush has put us in a war with no plan of withdrawal, cut veterans benefits, and for months our troops did not have the armored vehicles or even the bulletproof vest for all of them. Politics is weird..

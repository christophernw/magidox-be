Well, it's a story of adventure and love and courage and an imperfect man trying to find his way.  . . But more than the events that happen it's a metaphor for the journey that all of us go through in life when we try to push the limits of our own mortality, question the authority of a higher power, lose sight of what's really important in life, take an unexpected path and are both rewarded and suffer for it, but hopefully, eventually, find our way home again to our real purpose and meaning.

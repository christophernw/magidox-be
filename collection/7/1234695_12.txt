I would suggest that a good way to get your work exhibited is to enter open exhibitions. Often art gallerys put out open calls for artists; amateur and professional. If I were you I'd get in contact with local art centres or gallerys to see if they have any events like this coming up. If you have just started a group exhibition would be perfect for you as you only need to submit one - three pieces of work rather than a whole collection.. . Good luck

As of today I know of very few Christian fundamentalists that train their youth to go out and kill themselves and others. I don't always agree with the fundamentalists proposals in the govn't, it's really not religon's place in there, but they're not killing anyone. Extremists propagate the people of Middle Eastern countries to hate Christians and Jews (especially Jews). They have torn down separation of Church (I guess Mosque) and State to force their views on others.

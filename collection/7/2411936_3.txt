Christianity is an intensely personal religion... in fact, I would argue that it's not a religion so much as a relationship.  The relationship that a person can have with God though Jesus Christ.. . As a result, I think that responses to what a Christian sees as an attack on their faith and the lifestyle that they see as right in God's eyes varies wildly based on who speaks out.  And when people join together in congress together, joined by like minds, they can do wonderful or terrible things, either being together in doing God's work, or drifting towards each other and away from Him.  . . And, as it happens so often, the ones who are the loudest, the most destructive get the most attention.  In a choir, when there are many voices singing, but two or thee who are shrill and off-key, will you remember the chorus more or the ones who disrupted it?

To get good math grades you need to develop good math skills. It think the trick to learning the skills is to learn how the skills are useful in real life...how they can help you to do this and that. It will motivate you to learn and help you remember the skills. If you still have trouble, get a tutor. Also, math is a logical subject. One fun way to develop your logical side is to learn to play chess. Just a thought. Good luck!

I don't think most people have a problem with Immigrants. I think most people have problems with Illegal Immigrants. Those who break the law, knowingly, and continuously. Just because those who are Illegal have not been "caught", does not justify breaking the law. There is a process to become a citizen. . . A business (it doesn't have to be a big corporation) has needs to hire employees, it will always chose to hire those at the lowest cost. So if the "illegal worker" was not available at a low cost, then the business would obviously have to raise the wage to attract the necessary workers. Cesar Chavez, a hero to many latino workers, was in favor of discouraging the flow of undocumented workers from flowing across the border. He knew it would lower wages for all.. I don't know why people argue that if there were no illegal immigrants, that no one would do those jobs. Someone did them before the illegals came, someone would do it if they were gone.

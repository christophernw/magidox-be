Probably dry skin. Don't dry her with a hair dryer, let her dry naturally (in a warm house, don't let her out while wet). I was once told to put a tablespoon of cooking oil in my dogs food in order to add oil to his diet. That was a long time ago, you might want to ask a vet first. Good luck to you and her.

Just be yourself. If the girl you like is going to like you, she needs to like you for who/what you are. If you have to do something (pretendig to like things you don't or acting differently than you normally would) to get her to like you, then it is not really a good start. She won't be liking you for yourself, but for who or what she THINKS you are

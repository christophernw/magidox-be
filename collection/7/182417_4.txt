Well, a hormone is secreted in males to make them lie down after sex, and it's basically a huge release that tires you out. The combination makes you sleep pretty quickly, but women are hormonally different, and are of course capable of multiple orgasms. I suppose the excitement is what keeps her awake, but masturbation helps encourage sleep because of the physical assertion.. . Sorry mate, but as far as I can tell, she'll just have to find a natural way of sleeping. Whatever makes her tired, I guess.

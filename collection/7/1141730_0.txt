check the path of the fuel, starting with the tank itself. if there's some sort of debris in there you're throwing it up everytime you refuel and this finds its way through the fuel line. could explain the 20 mins for everything to settle down. also, earlier replies suggested a new fuel filter and a check of the fuel pump, both are good advice.

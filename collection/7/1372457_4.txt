chromatography is the separation of constituent chemicals or dyes from a solution.. A colloid is a state between a solution and a suspension. Basically, the particles do not entirely dissolve in the liquid medium (forming ionic/polar bonds). Instead, the solute bonds with one another as well as with the water molecules. . An example of a colloid would be jelly.

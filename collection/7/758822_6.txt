Yes we all came from Africa. . But it doesn't necessarily mean that we were dark skinned, because the climate may have been different, or Africa may not have been quite where it is now, due to continental drift. . . They did not "look Chinese" before they went east, but because of adaptive evolutionary changes which occurred in the hundreds of thousands of years while they were migrating. Thats how long it took, they did not just decide to pickup their belongings and walk until they reached the sea. Tribes and groups just expanded, followed water and food, etc about. If they wandereed into other tribes, they either integrated, fought with them, or moved on to areas where there was less competition. Gradually they filled out the Asian and European continent, and moved to North America via the land bridge which then connected the two continents, and down to Australia, via Indonesia and New Guinea, which were then not separated by water. . Their skin and facial features adapted over many years to suit the climate.

It means whatever you want it to mean!  Carpe Diem!  It means take today and make it the best.  It means wake up and smell the roses.  Make today the last day of life!  The Romans came up with this saying because you never knew what tomorrow would bring.  This same principle can be applied today!  So....Carpe Diem!

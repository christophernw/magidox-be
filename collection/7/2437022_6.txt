FYI- their is nothing " positive" about a war Republican Conservative don’t want you to know what is going on with the war and the death toll, I feel sorry for the people who think sticking to “Traditional values” will put us on top of the world, you know what they are wrong, we are being left in the dust, gas is up to $3.10, health care problems, Osama bin Laden who is that I forgot? We are killing women and children in Iraq, we took away running clean H2o in Iraq, we are killing these people slowly, “STAY THE COURSE” STOP FLAG BURNING AND BAN GAYS FROM MARRIAGE, don’t tell any one I remember Osama or they will put me a way in a cave and pump me with Conservative Traditional values by way of FOX NEWS, thanks you’re the best for not telling anyone

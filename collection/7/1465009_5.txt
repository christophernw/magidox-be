U have to take short showers and shorten the time u wash your hair with lukewarm water.  Dilute shampoo with water before u put on your head. Plus the shampoo can be a culprit too, u have to pick the right one for your scalp depending on your skin type.  If you have dry skin, don't use the clear shampoo.  It's too drying.  Personally, I prefer Pantein.  Hope that helps.

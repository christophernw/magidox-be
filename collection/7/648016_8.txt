To some extent, this can be true. The reason is because our pupils dilate according to the average light level in our field of view. If most of the sun is covered and/or the sky is very dark, your pupils will open further to let in more light. The problem is that any part of the sun that can still be seen is just as bright as it is normally, only now your pupils are dilated so it appears FAR brighter on the retina, causing damage quicker than normal. Since you tend to look directly at the eclipse, the light will be focused on your fovea, the part of your eye used for detailed viewing (the center of your vision). This one of the last parts of your retina you want damaged.

Dobermans are a great breed. Good family dogs, and protective of what's theirs.. Ear cropping is NOT recommended, as it's no medical, physical, environmental or cosmetic advantage for the dog to have the pinnas (the ear flaps) surgically altered. (Even in dog shows, they are allowing natural ears on most breeds.). The age is atleast 8 -12 weeks old. They are fully weaned, and preferably house-trained by then.

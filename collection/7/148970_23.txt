OK, let me just run this down for ya fast- John Smith was the founder of the Mormon religion. Back in the olden days, people were ignorant. Mr. Smith took advantage of this to take his own ideas about how people should live and infuse them with a seeming approval from God to make a new religion. He read magic rocks out of a hat for crying out loud. John Smith was a cult leader who made other people accept his ideas by making the ideas seem as they were God's laws. . Believe me, once you get deeper into the Mormon faith, you learn they still have a lot of weird ideaology. Not as weird as the scientologists, but weird nonetheless.

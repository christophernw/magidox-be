)o( Sunshine is correct. The only caveat is that you need to be a Christian so that you do not partake in an unworthy manner. If your heart is right, what you use for the elements is not so important. I have seen the use of crackers, unleavened Matzos (best), bread, pita.  For the wine, I have seem mostly just Welch's Grape Juice used.. . Read 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 when you partake.

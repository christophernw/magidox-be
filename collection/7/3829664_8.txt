Christmas as we know it is actually a colaboration of a number of rituals from very ancient religions.  (See links attached.). . Modern celebration of "Christmas" is more about fellowship and love of friends and family than it is about Christ's birth.  (That and the crass commercialization of the season.)  If we focus on appreciating and loving our fellow man and woman during that season - regardless of faith, race or station - I think we honour all people celebrating and that Jesus would be proud.. . So don't be ashamed of celebrating Christmas because you are not of the Christian faith.  Exchange reasonable and thoughtful gifts with loved ones..  Spend time with friends, family and make a special effort to see those without family nearby.  Celebrate being alive.. . Peace & Love,. RXZ

Most of the time they don't have any symptoms.  The most common symptoms include throwing up, diarrhea, poor haircoat, potbellied, thin.  Sometimes they will scoot with their bottoms if they have tapeworms.  Sometimes they will cough will worms.. . To tell for sure if he/she has worms and what kind of worms (dictating what kind of treatment) take a poop sample to your vet so they can check it.  It only needs to be a tablespoon and it must be fresh.  If you can't get it to the vet within an hour after going, double baggy it and put it in your fridge.  Remember that some worms are zoonotic, meaning people can get them.. . best of luck to you

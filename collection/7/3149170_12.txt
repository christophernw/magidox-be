You are asking “whenever islam is put to the test the question gets knocked off.”. . I don't have a clue to what really happens, but I would avoid answering any question that touches off a controversy.  If you tone down your words, I am sure you will get a better response.. . A Hindu professor, who converted to Islam, told me that the holy book of Sikhs, Guru Granth Saheb, has same opening verses as those of the holy Koran.  I you have any Sikh friends, please ask for the translation of the first stanzas of Japji Saheb to check this out.. . I  respect all religions including Islam, Christianity and Hinduism. To preserve freedom of speech,  we need tolerance and respect among all religions for peaceful coexistence. . . There is so much animosity and bloodshed now between Shia and Suni Muslims in Iraq, that the situation seems out of control.. . Sadam Hussain has already received a death sentence and now is on genocide trial in Baghdad. He is reported to have cited Prophet Mohammad and Jesus Christ who asked for forgiveness to those who opposed them.. . General Surayud Chulanont, the interim prime minister of Thailand, has visited  the restive southern provinces of the country a few days ago to restore peace. He apologized to the Muslim community for errors and excesses of the ousted government. . . My simple answer is, “Live and let live.” to preserve our freedom of speech.

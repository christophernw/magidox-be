Not sure another holiday is going to make a difference in the voter turnout. The addition of a viable 3rd party might be the ticket. Besides, I suspicion that people would rather use a holiday for their own use rather than something of this sort. Most employers are very happy to allow people slack to go to the polling places in my experience.

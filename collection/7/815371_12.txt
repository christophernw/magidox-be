The rule is "i before e except after c... or when ending in eigh, like neighbor and weigh." The last part of this little rhyme indicates that there are exceptions to the first part of the rule -- including the word "wierd." The entomology (or history of a word) usually leads to how it is spelled today, and there are a number of old words which could be the origin of the word "wierd," including the German word "wird." English has a lot of funny rules and conventions, and you were tripped up by one of them.

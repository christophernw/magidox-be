The biggest problem with sea water is not that it is "hard", (that is, contains dissolved calcium and magnesium carbonates) but that it contains salt, or sodium chloride. Hard water is not hazardous to drink, at least over the short term, although over the long term it might contribute to kidney stones, gallstones, etc. A human will get very sick very quickly by drinking sea water. . . Purifying sea water is called desalination. There are about 7500 salination plants world wide; about 60% of these are in the Middle East, and 12% are in the Americas. These plants use a variety of technologies. . . There are various approaches to purifying sea water. A very expensive method is to distill it; that is, to boil the sea water, and condense the water vapor that results. This method has been used for centuries on long sea voyages on ships. . . A cheaper, but still fairly expensive method is to use reverse osmosis. Reverse osmosis is used in Saudi Arabia and Israel and other desert countries, and in some locations with mineral-laden waters, like Northern Canada. In reverse osmosis, he water is driven by a pump through a semipermeable membrane (a piece of plastic with very small holes in it).. . A comparison of these two methods and their costs is included in the references below. .  . There are also several other methods that have been proposed for desalination, including  electrodialysis, and vacuum freezing. In electrodialysis, electrodes are placed in the water, attracting the polluting charged ions like sodium and chlorine, and leaving a purer residual solution. In vacuum freezing, pure ice crystals are formed by lowering the temperature, and then the salt and other materials are washed away. These two methods are not yet commercially competitive with reverse osmosis and distillation.

The thing is the very existence of the Jews is divine from from the beginning. The very fact that they still exist is one of the biggest miracles that exist in human history. The fact is the Jews are not bound by the same law of nature that all the other nations are. . . There existence is only to serve as G-d's people and when they fulfill that task they prosper. When they stray from the commandments G-d gave them they come under the laws of nature and they quickly suffer in that spot. It has all been  written and predicted 4,000 years ago.. . this is not a full answer to your question but to answer it fully would take quite a long time

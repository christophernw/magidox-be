I find it very irritating when I ask a question and get responses from people who are insulting or answer by telling me to ask a more intelligent question.  I just think that there a lot of people who are ignorant "true sense of the word" and if people ignore them or report them long enough they will just go away.  (Hopefully)!!! : )

drinking a lot more water, getting up and moving around every 30 mintues to get your blood flowing. Also exercising more, walking, or dancing, helps your immune system get stronger, which leads to fewer illnesses. Keeping active gets your energy pumping. If all else fails, store mini chocolate snacks in your drawers at work but keep a limited supply so your sugar rush won't lead you to crash, or else you'll feel even worse! Good luck

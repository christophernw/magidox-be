Telescope mirrors are highly polished concave lenses with a thin metal lining on the back side. They are "concave" on one side, flat on the bottom side. Concave is thin in the middle and thick around the edges. Metal would contract and expand as temperature changes so therefore would not be of value in observing.  The "Pyrex" glass of telescopes resists these temperature changes so is a readily stable medium.  The largest single mirror in the USA is the Palomar Observatory.  It has a mirror 200 inches across.  We do have a multi morro scope that gives the impression that it is larger but it has more than one mirror.  Six I believe.  The 236 in mirror in Russia is the worlds largest single mirror.  Except for the curvature of the earth, if a candle was lit on the sidewalks of London, Palomar could see it.

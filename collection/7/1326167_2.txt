A deist believes in a divine being who created everything and walked away.  Basically, a watchmaker who wound the watch and is letting it run on it's own.. . An agnostic basically says that there may or may not be a god.  It is impossible to really say.  . . An atheist does not believe in a god or gods.  I am an atheist.  I could be wrong.  I am also a skeptic.  I try to hold a scientific worldview.  Unless there is evidence for something, I will not acknowledge its existence.  Science can never acknowledge a supernatural god.  Science only deals with the natural universe, not the supernatural.

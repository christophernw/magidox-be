The dust and other particles present in the atmosphere sometimes makes the stars twinkle. Why the sun doesn't twinkle is because it is so much closer to the earth and thus it appears larger. The dust which is so much smaller than the sun's ray is not able to block sunlight and resulting in no twinkle in the sun.

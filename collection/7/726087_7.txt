It's actually pretty simple. All I see is a medieval torture device. Although when I look at a Catholic crucifix, it's more of a "dead guy on a stick" thing.... . It may amaze you that people turn their backs on "The Lord" but, it amazes me how people can turn their backs on reason. There is actually less morality in the Bible than in a Dr. Seuss book. Both are senseless and fun to read though.. . -SD-

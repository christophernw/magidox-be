Dolma is a family of stuffed vegetable dishes originating in Turkey and found from the Balkans to Persia. Perhaps the best-known is the grape-leaf dolma. Common vegetables to stuff include tomatoes and peppers. The stuffing may include meat or not. Meat dolma are generally served warm, often with sauce; meatless ones are generally served cold.

I would stop that tanning bed until you know what is causing this.  It could be the cream you're using, if any, with it.  It could also be that medicines or supplements you are taking are causing a sun sensitivity (like an allergic reaction to the sun).  If you're not taking anything internally that could cause this and not putting on anything topically, it could be your own body's reaction to the tanning bed and sun.  Autoimmune diseases can show up in skin reactions to the sun, so it's nothing to mess around with.  Check with your doctor.

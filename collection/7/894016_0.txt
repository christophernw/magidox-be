Depends on the stranger, if they are load and obnoxious then well, it is my private little joke, ya know.  If they are just someone standing there and you notice it I have walked up to them and tapped them on the shoulder and pointed and then backed off.  I would say that 90% of the time they turn with a red face and say thanks.  *hugs* ~:)

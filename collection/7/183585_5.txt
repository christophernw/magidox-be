If you believe a fairy tale/mythology is true and use it to guide you through the journey called life then it can be called "religion" and the associated written works "scripture". Religion and scriptures without belief are the same as every other mythology in mankind's past. Look at the Greek gods. At one time they were "living gods". In time the same will probably happen to the deities we worship. Including our world's most popular Living God. . . By the way, I accept the mythology/fairytales of my religion as a piece of the whole.

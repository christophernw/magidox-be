Because they are ILLEGAL and they don't care..They are using benefits that American citizens should be able to have first....Go into a grocery store any day of the week and you will see Mexicans with two carts full o fgroceries,,,,while we have to budget our money for groceries but they don't have to pay taxes so they get more money..They are taking away from the legals in this country and I for one am tired of it !!!!    They are rude, filthy ignorant  people and should all be deported back to Mexico .......Open your eyes see what is going on around you .........Then open your mouth and try to do something to fix it not stand up for it....You need to gain knowledge !!!!

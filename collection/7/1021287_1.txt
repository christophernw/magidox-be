I assume you are using a grand time scale, where an inch is something like 50,000 years.. Start with bacteria at the top of the tree.. Move down with amoebia and other single-celled organisms, and show the links in the chain as organisms get more and more complicated.. End with the 7 kingdoms of today (more complex is too complex).

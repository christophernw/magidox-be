This is a Jaina concept, and it means Fordmaker.  No, it's not Henry Ford!  Hahaha, sorry, just couldn't resist.  Anyway, the tirthankara has crossed the river of rebirths and samsara, and has also made a path so that others can cross.  The last Tirthankara was Mahavira.  So as far as I know, there are none currently in the world.  I am not Jain so I am not sure what they would say, but I am thinking that right now, Mahavir would be seen as the one who made the the bridge for others to cross, and that would be by following the Jain religion.

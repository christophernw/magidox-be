It's an empty metallic cylinder to get samples of water (from the sea). The cylinder is lowered on the water open. When it is at the desired depth, a "messenger" is droped from the ship down the cable. When the messenger impacts the bottle it releases a mechanism that closes the bottle with a sample of water inside.

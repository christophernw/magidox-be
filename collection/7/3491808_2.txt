the atomic # is at the bottom of the periodic table usually (the atomic #'s go in order, for example hydrogen is #1). . The atomic # symbolises the # of protons in the element (there are always the same # of protons as there are electrons in the element). . (so... hydrogen is atomic #1, has 1 proton, and 1 electron)

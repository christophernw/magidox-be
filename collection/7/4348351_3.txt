The best thing for insomnia is to stop watching TV at night.  No kidding.  It is the opposite of relaxing, it is STIMULATING!  Try it.  Spend your evening in dim light, doing something like listening to soft music, or visiting with a friend, or reading a magazine.  Take a bath or shower before bed, and snuggle down into the covers!  Try this for a week or so and see if it helps.

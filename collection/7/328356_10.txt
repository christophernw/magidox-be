I think you're stereotyping them too much. I'm sure if you go to any country, the Majority of People will still be only able to speak their native language, with the exception of places like Switzerland which are multi lingual right from the start.. Having said that though, I think perhaps one of the reasons why English has become a global language is because of a basic stubbornness and refusal by us native speakers to learn anyone elses language.. I CAN speak two languages though. (English and Japanese)

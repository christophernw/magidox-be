That sounds pretty bad!  Poor kitty!  I am guessing that you have already been to the vet but I would go again, maybe to a different vet.  I have never heard of this problem so I am not sure exactly what it is.  My cats have had ear mites before but only in the ears.  I think it is time to see a different vet and get a different opinion.. . I was in China a few years ago and had a great time and learned a lot!

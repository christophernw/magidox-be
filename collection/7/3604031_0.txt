The Northern Lights (aurora borealis) and Southern Lights (aurora australis) are both caused by charged particles from our sun. These high-speed, energetic particles are captured by Earth's magnetic field to subsequently interact with molecules in our atmosphere. The different colors of the aurora are caused by the various elements in the atmosphere.

Why on earth would you want to pierce its ear??????????????. What would have prompted you to come up with this idea?. If you really want your dog to stand out, buy him and yourself matching clothes!. Please dont do pirce his ear or anything else...its very wrong and can lead to other complications-him trying to get it off and the wound getting infected!

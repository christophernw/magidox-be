That really takes me back.  I used to love watching it with Vic Morrow.  Wanted to be just like him.  Strong but caring.. . Well, for one thing, society goes through phases when it comes to TV shows. One season it will be Westerns, another season, Science Fiction shows, then Crime Drama, then Comedy.  And on and on.  Right now, especially right now, because of the war going on, I think War films are out of favor with the public.

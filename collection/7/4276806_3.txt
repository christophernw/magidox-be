Think of it as a modern day court room setting.  When the trial is over (life) the defendant goes before the court (God).  He is pronounced innocent or guilty.  Later (at the last day of judgment) the defendant goes before the judge again.  This time the final sentence is delivered for final judgment, and the defendant (if guilty) goes on to their final punishment.... . There is a bit more to it than that simple analogy, but I hope that helps.

You can't. You can avoid taking responsibility for your child, and hope no one goes after you for child support, including health insurance.. . You stop being responsible for a child by the child being emancipated or being adopted by someone else, who thereby agrees to take over your duty.. . But there is nothing you can do arbitrarily to "give up" responsibility.

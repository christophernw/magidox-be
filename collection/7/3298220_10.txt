If there are a lot of women have complained about this, then I think you should start reconsidering the way you handle face-to-face conversations with them. If it is only one person complaining could be that she just had doubts.. . Anyway, the most polite way to talk to women is to look straight at their facesd while the conversation is going on. If you can't get your eyes fixed on her face (even just her eyes), it would be best to glance upwards rather than downwards. Better yet, give her that "blank stare". Do these things casually and naturally, so they won't notice.. . Good luck.

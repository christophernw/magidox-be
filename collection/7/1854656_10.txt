i ask the same question, was not the purpose of war to gain land originally? why didn't we just take over Iraq? it would be cheaper in the long run to just take these countries in as our own instead of borrowing trillions of dollars to rebuild them. i mean we have enough problems to deal with in our own country let alone in a country we just spent billions of dollars destroying

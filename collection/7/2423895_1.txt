Bush doesn't belong in office he's more of a buisness man, not a political person. Just think most of our military is over by IRAN right now, what does this mean we have very little defense over here now and this means if there was to be a attack on American Soil it would be critical. Just because President Bush wants all of our Soldiers over there. Not only to mention this he knew about 9/11 befor it was going to happen and still he did nothing about it. Now us Citizens in the United State can't controll what the government does we can only elect the politics, so do you think we are dim-witted now?

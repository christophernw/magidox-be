Circumcision is mutilation, and it is wrong, whether it happens to a girl or to a boy. In the countries where girls are mutilated and in many more countries where girls are not mutilated, they mutilate groups of dozens of boys, they all share the same rusty knife on the same filthy cot..AND NOBODY GIVES A DAMN.. because they think it is not so bad for a boy or they say there is some benefit to the boy for having it done. After fifty years of experience at being circumcised; my husband of thirty years knows there is no benefit to being circumcised, and he was circumcised in a hospital not in a vermin infested shack.. . Circumcision came about to remove as much pleasure from sex as possible, so people wouldnâ€™t be so interested in sex all the time and be willing to spend more time working in the fields, or serving in the army, or worshiping G*d. If they removed anymore from a man, his glans for example, he would not function and he could not produce any offspring to man the army of the king or to work in his fields or to serve G*d. The female has only to receive the sperm to reproduce, so the removal of pleasure can be more extreme.. . Female mutilation is normally carried out by the older females of the clan; who, like their counterparts the circumcised males, often see themselves as being improved and this is something that must be done. The male children are mutilated by the circumcised adult males.. . These barbaric cruelties to children of either sex have no place in an enlightened world.. That what diminishes the least among us in the least way, diminishes me; for no man is an island, entire of itself...any man's torture diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the torturer calls; he calls for thee. .. . While female mutilation is physically more extreme, both are equally morally wrong. As long as mutilation is condoned in this country, who are we to tell the rest of the world . what they do is wrong?

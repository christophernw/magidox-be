If it is not athlete's foot, then try this.  Slather diaper rash cream on your feet and then place them in two thin plastic bags (like the kind you get in the produce section of the grocery store)  Slide a couple of thick socks on and go to bed.  When you wake up, your feet will be as soft and smooth as a baby's bottom.  Seriously.

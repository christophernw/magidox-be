There is probably no easy answer to this question, so here are some questions to help you decide what to do. 1) What does he like to do?  Perhaps using something that he enjoys can be a motivator.  2) What are you trying to get him to read?  Is it too difficult?  Is it boring to him? 3) Have you considered the possibility of a learning delay or disability?  4) Do you read to him yourself?  Maybe finding books about something he likes, and reading them to him will be a motivator.  This is not an easy problem to solve.  Good luck!

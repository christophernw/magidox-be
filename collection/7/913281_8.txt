Easy. Put yogurt and fruit in a blender and turn it on. You might want to add a little honey or sugar. You can also use milk. You can put in ice if your blender will take it. for dairy free smoothie use tofu instead of milk or yogurt. Melons are good. also mango, berries, just about any fruit, really. Also, you can omit all the tofu and dairy and use water or fruit juice. The possibilities are endless.

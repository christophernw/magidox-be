I and no doubt millions of others have slept in the day light.  Many children need a night light to sleep.. . I think the reason why we generally sleep at night, is because we work during the day and the night is when we have the time to rest and sleep.. . Also, when we sleep, we don't need light so much, so God created the division of day and night, with the day being light and the night being dark.

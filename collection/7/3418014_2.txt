A word that sounds the same when translated into different languages.  For example, the Spanish word for legal is legal, the word for local is local, robot is el robot, etc.  Although the pronunciations are slightly different (in Spanish, legal is more like legALL instead of LEEgull), they are still very similar.  Thus, if you heard a new word in Spanish that was a cognate (say, internacional), it's similar enough to the corresponding English word (international) that you could guess what it means.

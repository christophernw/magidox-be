Because there is supposed to be a balance between plants growing (capturing carbon dioxide and relasesing oxygen) and animal population (eating plant, or eating plant eaters, which ceoms to the same thing in the end, and breathing oxygen, and releasing carbon dioxide). . . That said there is an imbalance as we are burning coal and oil that was carbon stored eons ago underground, so that balance is upset right now.

if you want to go straight, then forget about it. once you except that you're gay, then you'll be better. if you want to be straight just because some god of false love says that we are an abomination, then forget about him and his followers. find a religion that won't suppress your true self. as for those "former-gay-programs" they just make life worse. if you don't believe me, just ask some of the people who have survived those foolish programs. they will tell you that they just felt worse and wanted to commit suicide. hell, some have committed suicide because of those programs. so just except your sexuality and enjoy it. if anyone tries to tell you that you should change, either ignore them or kick them in the groin as hard as you can.

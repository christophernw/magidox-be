I must admit I liked BBC long before it got corporate sponsorship from, say, Shell. BBC always tells is like it is, with no gloss or anything. I trust -as far as it goes with any form of mainstream media- BBC a hell of a lot more than CNN or CBC, for that matter...what I love most about the Beeb is that even with all the death, doom and destruction they report, they always seem so chipper and cheerful. I mean, even on radio you could HEAR the professional smile in their voices: "Well, there's a giant asteroid headed towards earth. We have twenty seven minutes left until the destruction of the planet...BBC News!"

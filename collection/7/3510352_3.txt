Surely they can't legally keep pigs in an urban area? Check with Animal Control or the RSPCA, they may be in violation of health and safety regs by keeping them so near other people's homes, water supply etc.. You might want to visit the piggies with a phone camera and take pics of how they live...he probably doesn't keep them in proper conditions. And I don't think you're allowed to keep animals for slaughter so close to other houses...there are tight regs on how "pet" pigs are kept.. Edit: Note to lazlous..."rogue," not rouge. Rouge is blusher you put on your face. Learn to spell before you criticise someone else's punctuation.

i think it has something to do with eostre, the pagan god that easter was grafted from.. . or bunnies are symbols of spring, eostre was a bunny? well she was the god of spring i think.. . spring=plants coming back to live=resurection=a good time to place the holiday of the savior resurecting, very clever.. "hey, instead of celebrating eostre coming back to life, celebrate easter, when Christ came back to life" early christians were very clever like that.

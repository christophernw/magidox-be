Unfortunatly, you will probably need to find yourself a new bridesmaid or do with out her. I got married about 7 months ago and one of my original bridesmaid was a childhood friend of mine. All of us (I had 5 bridesmaids) tried to get together 3 times to look at dresses and not once did she go or call to say she couldn't go or anything. By the third time I said no more. Remember- this is YOUR day. Do not let anyone tell you different. One thing you might want to do is just straight up ask her if she is still wanting to be a bridesmaid. This might be her way of telling you she doesn't. Then just tell her you still would love her to come to the wedding and be a part of your special day and that you don't want to lose her friendship over it.

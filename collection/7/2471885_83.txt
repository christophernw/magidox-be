referring to the identical definitions you pointed out, there's obviously not a difference. there are a lot of words that mean the same thing (inebriation and intoxication, for instance). however, the words are not identical. i have encountered the word "apprehension" used only to mean "nervousness", and "comprehension" to mean the shared definition of "to grasp mentally." i think a lot of it has to do with connotation, so don't be surprised if people don't understand when you use apprehension to mean understanding...

Unfortunitly, dogs will always be considered status symbols by some people. These people get a dog only for "the look". They see rap stars with pit bulls, and then pit bulls are the "cool" dog to have. Be thankful that the Cane Corso's that the professional football players think are cool have not caught on! Maybe price is what keep the "ganstas" from getting them. If the price for Rotts and pits would go back up, maybe we would not have as big a problem.

"You're a b****" "You wish I was" or "I wish you knew me better". "I hate you" "Jesus loves you too". "You suck" "And my sister rides a bicycle!". Just change the subject.. Or, my favorite strategy:. Return mean comments with kindness.. Just be so unbearably sickeningly sweet to them that it drives them crazy. Offer them candy or gum and smile at them all the time. People who say things like that are trying to get a rise out of you and make you upset, so give them the OPPOSITE. I drives them crazy and they'll suffer big time. It's fun to watch. XD

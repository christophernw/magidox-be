In any event or statement, or any item, priority is given to the largest item. You would have observed by now that the answers occupy nearly 80% of the total volume. As per the conditions of Yahho! Answers, people prefer to answer and earn points, rather than ask questions and lose points.That is why it is called "Yahoo! Answers", and not "Yahoo! Questions".Hope this is clear to you.

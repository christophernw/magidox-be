God made us that way..................and it relaxes the whole body ................eyes are for seeing.............and to close your eyes is to reach the inner man.................and the inner man is at rest...........We close our eyes to pray (inner man reaching God) we close our eyes to kiss (inner man reaching love) and to sleep (inner man reaching rest)................and you can have all three with Jesus.........................

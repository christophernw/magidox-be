Because today's young generation is a rebellious one, and they have no concept of rules, regulations and how to fit into society without causing trouble.. . Think of the world as one big tribe. Let's say, for instance, there are 100 tribemembers who are living in the jungle. They have been getting along for generations.. . Then comes along a few tribe members who are controversial and troublemakers. They upset the order of things and other tribe members say...what is wrong with you? Why can't you get along with the rest of the tribe?. . If you want to get along in this world and be successful, you need to learn how to live in the group without a rebellious attitude.

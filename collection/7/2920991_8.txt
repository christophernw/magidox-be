be the alpha cat! with love and compassion.    she's a kitten , all kittens do that it's a natural thing.  tell her NO in a stren voice everytime she does it. sometimes you might even have to give her a tap to the head or nose while saying no.. she will learn!   BTW you don't train cats. they train you!! they do what they want =when they want. and if you love them, you will learn :)

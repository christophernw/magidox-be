This is actually a painfully stupid question. Every time a creationist asks it, it shows how little they understand the topic they're trying to disprove. So, for the love of goddess, please share this with your fellow Christians:. . A species becomes extinct when it cannot adapt quickly enough to a changing environment, or cannot survive its natural predators.. . A species does not just vanish into thin air just because one member of that species aquires a beneficial mutation.

If you believe in a higher power, the belief is that your creator made you so that you would have a need to believe in your creator.. . If you don't believe in a higher power, there are several theories, one of which is that man created the need, so that the king could control his subjects.. . It is interesting that you would use the word have. Generally the only things people have to have are food, water, and some form of shelter to protect them from the extreme elements. Though there are always exceptions, most people also need some form of relationship with others, and yes they also have a need to believe/question where they came from, where they are going, and what the purpose of it all is.

I often wondered this myself!  Is your glass half-full or half-empty? But seriously, the way I understand it, Partly sunny would mean just a little sunshine, while partly cloudy really means mostly sunny..   isolated thunderstorms are just a few here or there, but scattered thunderstorms are storms in more places...clear as mudd??

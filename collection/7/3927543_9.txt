Coca-Cola (and I know 7-up and probably many other soft drink manufacturers) allow the country that produces the soft drink to use whatever sweetener they like.  In the USA, companies use Corn Syrup because it is cheap here.  In Mexico, pure sugar is cheapest.  If you read the ingredients label on Coke bottles from other countries, then you will see that this is true.

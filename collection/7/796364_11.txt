That's a good question when you think about it. I went to catholic school (but that was MANY years ago), and if I remember right, it was simply a "representative title" in that he was the "father of the flock", much the same as the communion wafer was representative of the body of Christ. Also, supposedly he is the stand-in to the heavenly Father which is why Catholics confess to him, which I also never understood.

One....It's Adolf Hitler.....don't forget that...please. There's someone in history who needs to be remembered for reasons obvious. Now, Israel was non-exist ant at the time so Hitler established a program or as he termed it "The Final Solution" for all Jews in Europe. Not just Jews but Catholics, homosexuals, gypsies, mentally retarded people and anyone else who he and the Nazi party felt were not "ubermen" and superior in all racial aspects.. Hitler blamed the Jews for the collapse of the Germany economy after WWI and labeled them traitors as well as politicians who signed the Treaty of Versailles after the First World War. He claimed they controlled the economy and industries that sold Germany to the allies and caused all Germans to suffer humiliating defeat.. Jews were not allowed to have businesses, buy goods from German merchants and forced out of their homes to concentration camps or just executed in the streets.. This is why I say not to forget who Hitler was and what he was responsible for. If he were stopped after the invasion of Czechoslovakia his Third Reich may never have come to fruition.. . Oh...and for those chowderheads who actually have the audacity to say "Just like the Bush regieme"...you're idiots. Granted I'm no Bush fan either but to compare Bush to Hitler is ridiculous. I won't even enter into a debate on this. Better read up on history people. Regardless of what you may think Bush has not instituted a program for the systematic genocide of Jews, blacks, asians, homosexuals or any other race or religion or moral belief one may have.

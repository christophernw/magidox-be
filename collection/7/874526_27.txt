don't worry about a 2 week notice if you have only been there for one week to about 2 months (pretend you never worked there after you quit). . . Anything longer, a two week notice is EXTREMELY important. You'll have to put this job down on future applications.... as new places interview you and look at your job history, they may call them to ask how cool of an employee you were. Then they'll say you just stopped showing up for work. You may never get a cool job for awhile afterwards.

A good job is one I have had.  I work 9-1 p.m., I am the only one there most of the time, so no one is looking over my shoulder and second guessing my actions.  I have control over a great deal of what happens there...  THEN, I have a boss who loves me.. she is a great friend, as well as my employer.  She travels while I keep the office from imploding.. and while she is out and about, she very often finds things she thinks I will like, so I never know what I will find sitting on my desk when I come to work in the morning.. everything from flowers, to plants, to unique trinket boxes [which I collect] to todays offering..  a large number of matching picture frames for the wall I am covering with my own photography.  When she went to Europe, she came back with a trinket box from every country for me..  when she went to Cancun, she came back with a VERY expensive necklace.. and a trinket box..  from the Bahamas.. a VERY expensive necklace and a trinket box. hehe.. but the kicker???  Last Christmas, I opened a gift from her to find a chunk of the old Busch Stadium..  the one that is no longer there.. because, you see, I am a life long DIE HARD Cardinal fan and I went to that stadium from the day it opened.. and she took me to the last game there!  AND [from the Bahamas] she brought back a bottle of Pineapple Rum for me. ha  We hang out together on off days occasionally.. and she is always adding a bit extra to my paycheck because she says she couldn't function without me in the office..  so.. there you have it..  the best job.  If I HAVE to work, and at the moment I do.. I have the best job.

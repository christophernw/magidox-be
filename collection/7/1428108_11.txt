I don't know Brazilian culture very well, but I suspect that you eat a big lunch, or you eat another small meal sometime in the afternoon.  In America we don't do either of those things, so we are hungry earlier in the evening.  I think that Marie is right that this came from the farming tradition -- farmers go to bed early!

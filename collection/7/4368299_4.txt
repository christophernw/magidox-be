Chancer G,. . Given your statement, wouldn't it then make it fair for the Iraqis, Afghans and Palestinians to hold a grudge against the US? Not to mention all the british soldiers out there...judging by your previous questions you certainly don't think so concerning the first three! I'm sensing double standards! It's people like you, holding grudges, looking back, who prevent humanity from moving forward in peace.

i gofor a 2 hour bike ride when i can when i am angry. some times i have to go to work so i just try to hide my anger while i am there and after about 4 hours of runing around doing this or that (i work at wendys and most of the time i'm a runer, i do any thing any one needs me to.) i forget about why i am angry.

I wasn't aware of this.  However, I do know that green was considered an unlucky colour and it was surrounded by superstition.  One in particular is that the mother of the bride should not wear green at her daughter's wedding as it will bring bad luck to the marriage.  I have no idea where this originated, but I know a number of people who have followed this superstition, including my mother!

If you read the Bible you will know that the Jews are God's chosen people and Israel is the land that he gave them.  America supports Israel as part of God's plan, of course it does not say this in the Bible but just as God puts the governments of the world in place he is directing America in this way. Jews are there to stay, because God wants it that way and nothing will change it.

Why do lack education? Did you quit school? Did you stop learning? That's not anybody else's fault but yours. . It sounds to me like you are "stuck" in your "culture".. I am white but I did not come from a rich family but my dad worked hard to get us where we are today and I in return have a good work ethic where I work hard to give my family what they need and want. Does your family have a work ethic or do they depend on the governement?  When you do get money do you blow it on music & clothes or do you save for the important things?. Do people really descriminate against you or do you present yourself as immature and act like the world owes you?. Let me give you a tip.  Start acting and living like you want to be treated and people will do that.  If you want to be respected you have to be respectful, if you want to not be discriminated against, you have got to stop running your mouth about white people, if you want to be rich, you have to work for it.

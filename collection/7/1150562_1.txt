Alloy wheels were made mostly for racing in the beginning.They reduce unsprung weight so the suspension can react faster to the surface of the track, keeping the car more stable.Street rodders started using them and with a little imagination you have the cool wheels of today. They are a lot more upkeep and very expensive.

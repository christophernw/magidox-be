Delivering papers once a week. 125 papers door to door for $1.15 a week.  That was the going rate.I wasn't fighting an illegal (or undocumented .. PC version) over the job. That's what it paid. I took the job because it meant my own money and a sense of responsibility. It was cool being employed while some of my other class mates didn't have any extra money ! I was a kid ... it was something to do too !  1969 or earlier.

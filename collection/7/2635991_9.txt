listen to proZack. there aint nothin special bout mary.she aint xtra blessed or nothin.y are u asking about this "blessed virgin mary"?she aint no virgin no more.ya worship her , ur worshipin' somethin else aside from God witch is FLAT OUT IDOLITRY. NO worshiping mary.no.. anwho the only way u can see her as a example to our youth is that she trusted God no mater what situation came up.. God didnt send His son down so His mom could be worshiped, did He?

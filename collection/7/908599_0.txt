I certainly don't fear "the competition"...Besides the fact that my husband gets it good at home, most of the prostitutes I've seen are FAR from "very hot chick"...Most of them are drug addicted skanks who stopped trying to have any other skills when they realized they could make money off their own twat.. . Personally, I believe that it should be legalized, as this removes much of the mystique and sordidness from the whole situation.  Also, in most places where it's legal, they're tested for diseases on a regular basis, which obviously solves a major problem.

Get a bigger listing in the yellow pages, such as boldface type.  When I move to a new town, that is where I look for an agent.  Compile a list of reliable repair shops and offer it in your listing as a free maintenance and repair referral service for new residents.. . Also mention affordable no-frills liability insurance available.  Then use your salemanship to point out the advantages of a more comprehensive plan.. . And third, mention "Save money with family consolidation plans."  This just highlights the multi-line discounts you are already able to offer.. . Your best source of new business are in the three categories above.  The fourth category of getting people to switch insurance for a lower rate or better coverage is pretty tough now that online insurers like Geico spend so much on advertising.

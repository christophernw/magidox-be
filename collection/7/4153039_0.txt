Tell your parents straight up that you will not accept the blame for their arguments and that you will no be the scapegoat for their problems in their life. It may be so that they argue about something related to you but their inability to resolve the issue shows their is some problems brewing between them for some time before and instead of facing them they blame you. Tell them how you feel and let them know that is sad that they are not been adults and instead of helping you grow as a person they are limiting you and making you feel bad.

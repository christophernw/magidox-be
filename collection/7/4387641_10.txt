easy :D all you have to do is get him/her a block of wood to scratch!! the reason the do this is to split their claws in half and grow new ones! its normal you cant get him to stop but you can get him to do it to a large block of  warn wood not sanded but a nice block of wood or go you your local pet shop and buy a cat post ^^ they have huge ones at pet-a-rama and petco! . . Hope your couch dosen't have to many holes!

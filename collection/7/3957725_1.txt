Dancing is no more than walking...to a beat. Walk forward, walk backward, walk with side steps...one foot after another...no more, no less. Don't try to make it more than it is ... it is NOT scary at all. Put your Right hand in the middle of her back, hold her right hand in your left...and start walking to the rhythm..That's it..you are now dancing..Good luck, and have some fun.

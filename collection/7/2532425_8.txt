Work on the positive aspects of your life and use it as a weapon to overcome everything else. Start slowly, be really good at something and then you will find that people will follow you. I believe it is not about confidence that makes a person sucessful, it is how well they express themselves. . . They say Confidence comes NOT from always being right but from not fearing to be wrong.

God is a god of free will and we as christians are not supposed to press any one the bible says not to cast your pearls before swine and give what is holy unto dogs. Only God homself can save a soul the only thing we can do is let our light shine and pray that it will happen. If it is God's will than he will recieve. The blood is off your hands now. Lets face it...most athiets do not want to hear you talk about religion because it is dead near impossible to do it without making them "feel judged"  just keep the faith show them through your life that bieng a christian is awesome and who knows you may inspire him...don't give up

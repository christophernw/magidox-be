It's like God, why was he born and why did he die? We were born to Love and God gave us a life, with Free Will to live it to the full and when we die something good happens through it, just don't think that 'cause something good might happen if u don't think about and when we die God will chose if we live in Heaven or Hell. When we die it actually means that we have live our life to the full.

I think you need to learn the proper way to prepare a good cup of tea. First you need GOOD tea leaves, most likely not from a grocery store. I like to get them from the tea leaf. You need a device to help steep the tea, and bottled water helps. You should boil the water on your stove, and then pour into your cup. Add your strainer, and cover the cup for 4 to 5 minutes. Try to use minimal amounts of sugar, try to use raw sugar or honey. . Remember, good tea is the key..........

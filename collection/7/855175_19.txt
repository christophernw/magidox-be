US was into second world war long before Pearl harbour bombing. As a matter of fact pearl harbour was bombed to weaken US when it entered the war. . When the war in Europe broke out - and france fell, given the anglo connections it was anticipated that like the first world war US will again come in to aid allies.. . why US entered war - well because . 1. an average american wanted it.. 2. american trade and hence all important money flow was dying - its trade partners were falling one by one to the Axis. 3. The war in Pacific was almost a backyard game - which meant a japanese landing on west coast was possible - hence if US didnt goto war war would have come to it.

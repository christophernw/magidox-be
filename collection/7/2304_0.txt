"'A bachelor's degree is called a bachelor's degree because it won't get you paid enough money to be able to afford to get married' -- Nick Wilson", but seriously:. . "The college degree is called a "Bachelor's" degree after the original meaning of bachelor, which was a young apprentice. Since the Bachelor's is the first degree issued, coming before a Master's or Doctor's degree, that first degree became known as a Bachelor's degree."

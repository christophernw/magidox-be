I like your quote -- wisdom lurks there.  As to the question: I realized by the time I was eight years old that the bible could not be reconciled with the scientific evidence, and since the science is obviously right (it works!), religion had to go.  I have subsequently put this metaphysics on a sound logical foundation, and hope someday to publish a book describing how it all works.

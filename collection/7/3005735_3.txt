Have you smoked? Have you tried quitting? Do you know anyone who's tried quitting?. It's hard, some people can stop and start as they wish but others are addicted to it and it's difficult to stop,  especially if they go out anywhere where people smoke or work in smokey places or live with other smokers, the craving's always there.

Hey Michael.  I'm so glad to hear that you are planning on joining a Christian church.  My first bit of advice to you would be to contact the church office and speak to the minister of whomever is in charge of Involvement.  That way you can get you questions answered right then and there.  You can also ask questions about how you can become involved in ministry opportunities.

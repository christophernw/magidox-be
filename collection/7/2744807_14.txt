We know that Jesus was a real person because there is independent corroborating evidence (i.e. Roman historians)that he was a real person with a following who was executed.  . . Of course, we do not have any independent corroborating evidence of any of the really interesting claims made in the gospels e.g. that Jesus did miracles or that he was the son of God or that he rose from the dead.

that's pretty gross, but you can stop by just telling yourself to stop.  it's called self control.  I used to bite my nails all the time and then one day I just decided to stop b/c my nails looked gross and I didn't like it.  it was just that easy.  reward yourself for every day that you don't pick at it.

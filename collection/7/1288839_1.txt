Yes I would like to know what stars are the same....In the North Orion is a winter constellation and Scorpio is a summer one. Cygnus the swan is a summer one but not visible in the winter.  HOWEVER - the big dipper, little dipper Cassiopeia are "circumpolar" and never disappear above 40 degrees latitude, thus you will see them every night all year

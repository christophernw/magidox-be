Well, you could try what my kids did.... They poured my iced tea into the fish bowl, and after the caffeine kicked in, the fish went on a feeding frenzy because the kids had dumped most of the can of fish food in as well.. (What a way to go, eh?). Needless to say, the fish rose to the top of the bowl.... and shortly afterwards, took a "field trip" to the sewer.

yes i believe it`s kind of true. decent food in u gives ur body the nourishment and vitamins to help ur body fight colds and flu. i don`t believe in taking remedies for colds because i think it confuses the body and prolongs colds. i used to take remedies but i`ve found that if u just eat food and have hot fluids going into u ur cold clears up a bit quicker

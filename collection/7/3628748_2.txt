You know I lost my shelf once.... I was devastated. It was my favorite shelf. Then one day I remembered, I forgot to unpack it when I moved.... I felt so stupid. Since I unpacked it and put it in the right spot I am fine. Take a look, you may have forgot to unpack yours! Best of luck on finding that shelf!!!! . .  HONESTLY..... don't let our stupid jokes offend you, we're all just bored. Honestly we haven't found ourselves either. I bet if you stop looking for who you should be, you would probably realize that your a pretty great person! You don't need some old survey to tell you who you are. I'm sure if you take a few minutes, you'll find some great things out about yourself!! SMILE.... this is a great place to start!

Been awhile that I have heard this term. Can not find my Business management book, so, I shoot from the hip here. Many Companies give various rates on a product. This is usually used in Volume Buying. They may give two different prices to get payment faster. It may say Net in 30 days and the Maximum in 60. Not remember the Terms, but, something like; Full60 Net30 and will show the Amounts like;  $179.80  and   $152.60  this examples. So, by paying faster you can save money or wait and pay the full Amount. Wish I could remember this better, but, you can get the idea.

you go to court.. . the judge will ask you if you're guilty or not. If you say guilty you just pay your ticket and they add the points to your liscense, which will dissapear in 2 years and your insurance will probably go up. if you say not guilty, then they reshecdule you and you have to come back and fight it.. . since you admitted to speeding just say that you're guilty, pay the fine and go on with your life. You won't loose your lisence over a speeding ticket.

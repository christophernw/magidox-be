This gas is also known as the Lachrymatory Factor (â€˜crying factor'). It stimulates the eyes' lachrymal glands so they release tears. This gas is instable and can react with water which results in, among others, sulphuric acid. When this happens in the eye, the eyes start to neutralize the acid by producing large amounts of water, and thus make us cry. . . Cooling your onion before cutting

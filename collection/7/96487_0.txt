9 weeks is still young.. 3 months is the usual age for house training.. crate training works best, if you allow them to pee on paper in the house they will be confused later as to why they cannot always pee on things in the house.... . they poop more if you feed crappy food with loads of filler.. all foods from grocery store or Wal Mart are crappy foods.. some crappier than others

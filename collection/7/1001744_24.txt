Cause that's what they want from you. You must be hot! And they know it will introduce a playful contradiction game on your part that will lead them to engage you in a conversation that borders on sex-talk.. . Oldest trick in the book.. . Variant on "I used to know a stripper named Alexis...".                  "I used to have a girlfriend named Alexis...".       . It's a subtle way to call you sexy and insult you at the same time. Putting you down, showing stregnth on their part and forcing you to defend yourself, and therefore into their ensueing "love-trap" or engaging conversation.. . Also, I can tell you like the last guy to say this to you, since you thought about it enough to question it. In fact you've already had sex with him, he just doesn't know it yet.

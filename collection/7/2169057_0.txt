Here's the trick:. . Luckily it ain't a 96.... . Either way, dodge puts all the a/c and heating in a single box that is bolted to the firewall. You have to pull the whole danged box out. If it were a 96, whole danged dash comes out. On yours, only half comes out.. . Disconnect battery so you don't have to worry about shorting something out or blowing out the airbags when you move the wires... . . On yours, you just have to pull the heater controls, radio, and the entire knee bolster (the lower trim panel that faces your knees), including the lower center console (ash tray, misc storage, etc).. . Get all the misc wiring harnesses, vacuum lines, and other BS out of the way and disconnected from the box.. . Drain radiator. Disconnect the heater hoses.. . Disconnect the a/c lines (pull the 13mm that secures the line to a block. Then take the two torx head screws out of the block). Then you have to pull all the nuts that secures the heater box to the firewall.. . Put the box on the ground, and take it apart. About 400 screws hold it together.. Make sure when you reassemble the box all the doors move...else you get to do it again.... . Reassemble.

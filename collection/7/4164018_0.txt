check to make sure your spark plugs are not grounding out.. i usually had this problem when it rained, one of my spark plug wires was cut so, it was grounding w/ the engine causing a low idle.  also, check the spark plugs make sure non of then are cracked. a good way to check this is at night so u can see a spark if grounding out.

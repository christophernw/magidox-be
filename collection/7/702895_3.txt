I out-grew the present receiving in my teen years learning that it is better give then to receive. I don't look for presents and haven't for many years but yet I still receive presents from my children and also give to them. I retain the family tradition of giving presents to my grand-children but stop giving once they graduate from High School..   Christmas to me is my religious teaching that it is the birth of Christ, and that still remains my thoughts of the celebration, and other religions celebrate in their own ways..   So it is not just another day to me but the day we worship the birth of the Christ child.

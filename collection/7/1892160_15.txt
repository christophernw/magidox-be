it's a psychological reason actually.  for whatever reason, $1.99 9/10 seems al ot cheaper than $2.00 even though there is only 0.009 cent difference.  with a 16 gallon fill up, that's only a saving of .144 cents to us.  however, for a gas station owner that may have 100+ cars fill up every day, that's at least extra $14.40 in his/her pocket.. . it was actually 'invented' by the jews who were master businessmen in the early 1900's.

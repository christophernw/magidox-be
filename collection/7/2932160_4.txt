Red Bull, caffeine, etc. are the worst things to drink when you are trying to concentrate. They will keep you awake, but they will make you fidgety, and restless. They will make your mind wander, and trust me, from experience, you will end up being like, ok, I can't do my homework, so I'm going to go to bed, and then you will be up all night, and worse off in the morning, than if you hadn't done your assignment, hadn't drinken the Red Bull, but had got some sleep.

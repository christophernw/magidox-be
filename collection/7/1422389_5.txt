Can you cancel the loan or has he already rec'd it? If the loan went thru then there's no way they'll remove you from it. Sounds like you have way better credit than he does and that's why he needed a co-signer.. . A pre-nup will not protect you either since I'd assume he has no assets or collateral to secure a lien on in the future. All he has is his word to repay it. . . This is tough because you want to trust in your significant other but you must also plan for a whatif. I did not do the whatif and I have lost $15k of my retirement, never to see it again. I have no job but he does. I have no house but he does. (pre-marital) Legally, I am screwed. Please get him to get a new loan with his parents or anyone else but NOT you. Get off the loan!

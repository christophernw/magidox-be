Bolts of fabric were sold in 9 yard units.  Normally someone would come into a store amd just buy as much as they needed.  They'd browse the shelves, then have the storekeeper measure it out on brass tacks on the counter ("coming down to brass tcks").  Other times, when someone was feeling extravagant or had a really big project, they would spring for the whole nine yards.

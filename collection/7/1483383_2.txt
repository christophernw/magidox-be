you can talk your Dr and get on meds, do the herbal thing, or pull your self out, which many people dont believe you can do, but i do.  if you know you are unhappy and you think you need to do something than try changing what makes your disease trigger.  it will be hard but i honestly think someone can pull them self's out.

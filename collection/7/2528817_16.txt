You don't get a doctor to prescribe Ritalin for you.. . What you do is go to the doctor and tell the doctor how you've been feeling.  You could have a thyroid problem or depression or a million other things.  Ritalin could make those problems worse.. . Get the correct diagnosis before you medicate yourself

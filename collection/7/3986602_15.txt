It is the color & the shape. The number one thing that makes a face look good is symmetry (the correct distance & balace between things). It it what people look for in life & patterns that they find attractive.. . People were asked to judge faces on a monitor & 86% all rated the same symmetrical faces as attrative. Then another group was asked to use a program to create an attractive face and the outcome was the same.. . To see if this was from birth, adults with symmetrical judged faces & those that were not, were put in front of 16 week old babies. The babies looked at the symmetrical faces almost 10 times longer then those without (skin color had no effect).

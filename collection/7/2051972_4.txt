Why do the majority of Christians on here mock Atheists because we are enlightened enough not to have our lives governed by a discredited book.. . EDIT. . The baptist church held BANQUETS during the aftermath of Katrina - surely they would have been better off helping all, not just laying on lavish feasts for the few ............... I suggest you learn what BANQUET means before using it to try to prove Christians are better than the rest of us.

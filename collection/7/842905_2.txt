i'm not sure if the wieghts you published in there is factual since it is not 100% or add up to 1.. . this is how eighted averages works.. . example:. . tests  is 40%  of your grade.. homework is 20%. project is 25%. class participation is 15%. notice that the total is 100%.. . suppose:. you got 40 out of 50 in tests, its percentage is 40/50=80.. homework is 94.. project is 85. class participation is 90.. . this is the computation:. components   times    weight. (must be in %). TESTS     ===>        80  x  .4      =     32            >since 40%=.4. HMWR     ===>        94  x  .2      =     18.8. PRJCT     ===>        85  x  .25    =      21.25. CPRTN    ===>        90  x  .15    =     13.5. TOTAL GRADE                           =     85.55     . . I hope this helps!

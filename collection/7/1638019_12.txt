Classic deception tactic. Keep your opponent off-guard by falsely attacking their loyalties.. . And this is the self-proclaimed "family values" crowd. ;). . PS Roch Cop: When did any Dem ever call an attack on Clinton an attack on America? I've never heard of that. If it was a single comment overlooked by the rest of he world, it was still a far cry short of the constant cries of the GOPs.

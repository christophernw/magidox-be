That's a really broad question.  Let's see....Egypt was trying to position itself as a Pan-Arabian power....Jordan's King Hussein was trying to wrest control of his country from a powerful pro-Palestinian movement.  The US and Russia were embroiled in the Cold War and both sides had an interest in the Middle East....the Russians were arming Egypt and the US was arming Israel.  Geographically, the West Bank of the Jordan river still belonged to Jordan, the Golan Heights were still part of Syria, and the Gaza Strip belonged to Israel.. . Israel captured all three of those areas as a result of the Six Day War, and even had possession of the SInai Peninsula in Egypt until they agreed to turn it back over to Egypt after US pressure.

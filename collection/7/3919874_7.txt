It can be a real pain but at least you've gotten past the crazy teenage years and those are worse. I've found that having some older friends has helped me because I can get better advise on everything from how to deal with my kids to buying a car to all the lovely medical/physical issues that come up (that your younger friends would never admit to!) All in all though it's not as difficult as you probably are imaging it to be.

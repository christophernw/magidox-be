Most of these answers are good, but two are definately wrong.  Some enzymes break chemicals apart, but other enzymes help to create chemical bonds and join two chemical elements.  The key is that the enzyme increases the rate of the reaction.  However, there are different types of reactions that enzymes catalyze.. . Second, enzymes are not always secreted by ductless glands.  Some enzymes are not secreted at all, but remain inside the cell.  Furthermore, some hormones are secreted into ductless glands, so that point about glands with no vessels has absolutely nothing to do with what enzymes are.

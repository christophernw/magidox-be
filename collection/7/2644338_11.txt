The National News on CBS, ABC, and NBC are my main source of news. online I use CNN and MSNBC. I don't think any of the shows you mentioned above can be considered news because they tend to be biased. O Rielly is a hardcore conservative, and Al Franken is hardcore liberal.Leno's monolouge tends to be more liberal than conservative too.

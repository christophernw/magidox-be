When I was up in Skye a couple of weeks ago, there were very few Scottish accents - the majority were English, with a lot of Dutch tourists thrown in! So, there might be some Welsh there, too. However, I am in agreement with most of the comments so far - the Scots sound Scottish, and the Welsh sound Welsh - OK, both accents are lilting, but that's about as far as it goes. Having lived in Scotland for the past three years, and with a best friend who is Welsh, I find that there is no comparison between the two accents.

An allegory (Greek: allegoria), is a prolonged metaphor in which a series of actions are symbolic of other actions, while the characters often are types or personifications  That does not mean, however, that the characters are not historic.  Allegories can include illustrative characters but , as in the case of this one given by Paul, can include real life persons.  There is no basis for believing that Sarah, Abraham and Hagar were not historical persons.. . Moreover, in this same bible book, this scholar Paul says: “Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. It says, not: ‘And to seeds,’ as in the case of many such, but as in the case of one: ‘And to your seed’ who is Christ.” Galatians 3:16.  Clearly, Paul, in identifying the seed as Christ, is here speaking of Abraham as an historical person and not a fictitious character.

Actually, nothing can be proven; things can only be disproven. That's the point of science.. . I was having a debate with a teacher of mine the other day about the reliability of science. The conclusion to which we came was that science is unreliable because it doesn't take all possible factors into consideration. Like evolution. Personally I believe in the theory of evolution; but the fact that science went about trying to "prove" this by saying "Alright, this is definitely what happened, assuming the supernatural does not exist/does not affect our world" makes me wonder. Whether you believe in the supernatural or not as an individual is your choice to make, but it IS a possibility, and therefore saying someone is a genius because they "don't let their feelings get in the way" or because they don't get caught on religion is a little unsound.. . Then again, "genius" is a matter of perspective.

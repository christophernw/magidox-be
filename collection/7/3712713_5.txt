Get involved in clubs whose activities you really care about, maybe a sport or drama or something. They don't all have to be through your school, friends outside of school are good too. Just say hi to random people in the hall and do things like pick people's books up if they drop them... that way if you have a bad reputation (I don't know your situation, I'm just guessing), that will help. Be who you are and people who are like you will want to be with you. Stay true to yourself, you are your best friend in the end.

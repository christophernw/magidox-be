spelling the pronounciation of chinese words using roman characters might be useful for those who want to study chinese language such as mandarin,hokkien,cantonese and others.chinese characters are very hard to learn,read and  write.. . Some chinese speak chinese,but they don't know how to write the characters.say you want to copy a chinese character,you probably wont succeed/your writing would be really ugly.writing chinese characters is considered some sort of art.. . plus,each characters are meant for each meanings.exm: the word "si/se".it can mean die or number 4. that's why the chinese characters exist to differenciate between these two.and eventhough the word "si/se" is the same,the chinese pronounce them slightly differently,depending on the meanings.

This is due to the extremes in temperatures that the asphalt goes through on a daily basis. As the sun heats up the road the asphalt will expand and create these "stretchmarks". As the temperature drops the asphalt will contract closing the gaps. The roads are designed to do this at certain points in it's construction. If not, then the whole road will break up in huge sections and then you'll need a 4x4 to get to where you're going.

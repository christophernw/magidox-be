Look I have a problem with people who think that the destiny of my soul depends on the condition of their bicycle (whether they will arrive at my door or not). Or is that the JWs? Regardless, they seem to be decent people and when they come I don't mind the conversation especially since they're all ears and listen carefully when I tell them what Master really taught, and I have even accidentally converted two of them.

go ahead and sue tom.you wont get anywhere.im so sick of the whiney black men in this country still crying about slavery.i as a white man agree that it was a crime against humanity and a sin against God to enslave any man and to rape and beat them like they did.however no black man alive today in this country has ever been a slave to the white man so man up and get over your crying.you never even met your great-great-great grandparents to run your mouth.to them i apoligze as a white man for the crimes committed against them by my forefathers...to you i say get over it.you were born free and the only limits you have are the ones created by yourself.no white man is holding you back.so be the man God made you to be and forgive and accept it as something that none of us can change but remember them in your prayers..as i will.good day.

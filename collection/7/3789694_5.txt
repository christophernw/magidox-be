Pinch, biting I cannot see that as discipline in any circumstance. But I would say that  the main differences would rest on intent and end result. Discipline comes from a position of love, whether it involves corporal punishment or otherwise. It's goal is to correct or keep them safe from harm. Abuse, whether physical or mental, is aimed at hurting the person at some level. There is no love at all involved in those actions.

Try to find someone in r&d.  . But don't get discouraged if there are people who will refuse outright even to look at your idea.  This is not because they think your idea is bad, it's because they want to avoid the risk of you suing them for royalties if they brought similar product to the market when in fact their R&D has been developing a similar idea long before you submit your idea to them.

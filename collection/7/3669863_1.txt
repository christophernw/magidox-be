Rise over run is NOT the Pythagorean theorem. Rise over run is the slope of a line. It is measured by taking the quotient of the difference vertical change in position to lateral change in position. A negative slope is one whose line falls in the direction from left to right while a positive slope rises the left to right (depending on how your coordinate system is defined- a right handed coordinate system behaves this way)

did someone wake up on the wrong side of the bed,are you cranky today? i dont throw my butts on the ground,and im always respectful of where i smoke,really. on the other hand,on several occasions i have had animals go thru my trash,only for me to find it all over my perfectly manicured yard,i didnt ask for that either..i may have a problem with smoking,but im soo gratefull that im a happy person. i dot have a problem with letting others be who they are,do what they want,last i heard it was a free country..love &light to you

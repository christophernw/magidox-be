I believe that it had something to do with removing demons from your body, and a plague also.. "ring around the Rosy,. pocket full of posies,. achoo, achoo,. we all fall down". that rhyme was describing a plague, you would get a Rosy patch on your skin with a ring around it. it was though that keeping posies in your pocket would protect you.. you would get a sneezing fit, and ultimately die. so god bless you.

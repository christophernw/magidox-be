Depends. If u r close to the sun, it's very hot. If u are away from the sun, it's cold. Besides, it's warmer in a planet's atmosphere than in outer space. For example, on Earth, the normal temperature is 25 degrees C, but if u go in outer space, where the satelites orbit around earth, it's below zero C.

This is a tradition of man and not Biblical based as the only ones who are candidates for baptism are born again believers. The act of Baptism cant save any one or wash away original sin as some claim as only the blood of Christ can do both.The water birth mentioned in John Ch. 3 is in fact our physical birth and not baptism.

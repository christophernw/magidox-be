Its difficult but possible by spreading awareness among people by telling them what exactly they need and what are they being denied from etc...these information must be given to every children from their childhood only then will they know their rights...the entire government is opaque then how will there be awareness?? the fundamental frame itself is wrong!! But still a change is possible!! How many are willing to spread the knowledge?? Thats what is needed to be known!!

The difference is that one ad agency thought that the term MoonRoof had a better sound (classier) than SunRoof. They both are ports in the roof of a car that allow some light and may be able to open to allow air in a car.  One may be tinted but that is not the difference, they are marketing terms for a hole in the roof of a car.

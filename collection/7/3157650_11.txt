1. An invisble sheild around that could protect me from injury. 2. A time machine so I could travel back in time to before Europeans came to America and the Natives had never seen a white man.. 3. Super Health. . . The Native Americans arrows could not pierce my armor and when they see my flashlight or other modern technology they would bow before me and worship me as a God.. I would rule North and South America

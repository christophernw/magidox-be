I went to the County Fairgrounds this weekend, and they have buildings where the County residents show their Prized livestock.. . It seemed odd that the Pigs building was labeled "Swine", and the Poultry building was labeled "Poultry", but the Cow building was labeled "BEEF". Why not "Bovine"?. . We should call things what they are - Beef should be "Cow", Pork should be "Pig", and Mutton should be "Lamb".. . But, more importantly, Veal should be "Tortured Baby Cow", and Shrimp should be "Cockaroach of the Sea", Squab should be "Dead baby pidgeon", and Eggs should be "dead baby chicken embryos.". . I think the restaurant industry would complain.

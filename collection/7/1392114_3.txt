To check the spread of Aids among taxi drivers i suggest that each taxi driver must get his complete body check up including blood once a year like how we get our cars registration every year. It must be done only from the Govt. organisation and free condoms should be supplied by the govt and also by making them aware of AIDS and the ways to prevent it by distributing brochures, leaftlets etc in every laungages (hindi, marathi, punjabi etc).

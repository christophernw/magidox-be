a first class(>60%) in Biology, Chemistry, will count high for Nursing...there are Degree(=B.Sc.),and diploma courses, Degree is better, but will require higher grades too!. for Law -- a B+ in Humanities subjects =Civics, Language, Social sciences will probably help, tho any majors are acceptable, there is usually an entrance test u have to qualify first

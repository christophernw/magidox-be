You have to remove the dash trim around the radio, cup holder, and ash tray area to get to the screws for the radio. So look around the trim the see any screws. Open the glove box, there might be 1 or 2 there aswell, at the base and over twards the steering wheel. If not, it will atached by clips, so you would just pull it off.

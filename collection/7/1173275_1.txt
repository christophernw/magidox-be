He developed as an original idea the numerical approach to calculus, while Leibnitz working independently from him tried to develop a more philosophical approach to calculus himself.. They then both pretended to have been the first to "invent" calculus.... Anyway, Newton's numerical approach has been proving itself more and more precious with the development of computers and the mechanized numerical calculus; for exemple, the iteration method developed by Newton to find the solutions of non-linear equations ("tangents method") has become the base of numerical equation-solving with iteration methods.. . Then there are a lot of contributions to physics (gravitation theory, property of light), and some other mathematical objects such as the coefficients in the development of the power of a binomial bring his name.

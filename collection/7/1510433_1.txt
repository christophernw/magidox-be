i actually cant answer this question but I have one for you.  My husband has social anxiety and I have a hard time understanding it. Why cant you just go to social functions and learn to deal with them?  Not to be harsh, just want some advice on supporting him and helping him.  He used to drink to deal with social situations, now he's trying to quit so we dont do anything it seems like anymore!!

Adult stem cells (somatic stem cells) are found in many different body tissues, but their exact origin is unknown.. Adult stem cells are relatively undifferentiated cells that can, under the right circumstances, start dividing and producing specific tissue cells.  An adult stem cell can't become any tissue cell in the body; the blood stem cells can become different kinds of blood cells, and so forth.. It seems that small numbers of stem cells live within the body tissues without reproducing, until activated by injury or disease.  Regular body cells reproduce themselves most of the time, without recourse to stem cells.

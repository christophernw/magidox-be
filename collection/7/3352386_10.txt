A prophet prophesies -- a believer in the Way shares their faith respectfully.  If anyone tries to push it down your throat they are in the wrong.  It is up to each individual to choose whether they believe Jesus is the son of the living God or not.  Each person chooses what they will believe about Jesus Christ and since he is the only bridge humans have to God and heaven, the choice we make about what to do with Jesus Christ determines where we spend eternity.  It's entirely your own choice -- it's up to you.

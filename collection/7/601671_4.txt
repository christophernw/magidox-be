IT DEPENDS WHERE YOU ARE .HERE IN THE UK EVERYONE WORKS HARD WHETHER IT IS IN THE SUN,SNOW OR RAIN.IT'S NOT ABOUT COLOUR BUT IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH WHAT QUALIFICATIONS YOU HAVE AND YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES AT THAT TIME.IN THE CASE OF MEXICANS, SOME OF THEM HAVE TO WORK IN THE HOT SUN BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT THEIR CHOICES (IN USA) ARE LIMITED.HOPEFULLY THIS WILL CHANGE.

If you're attracted to both blond(e)s and redheads, how could you ever be faithful to one partner? Exact same illogic.. . Maybe it's that lots of people understand homosexuality and heterosexuality as opposite sides of the same coin, that people are attracted to *a* particular gender; while bisexuality is more difficult for many to relate to.. . Other answerers were exactly right to point out that monogamy, in/fidelity, and polyamory (open, honest, multiple loves with everyone's consent and considering everyone's feelings) are independent of whether one is gay, straight, or bi (or unlabeled).

I was told by a great mystic women that they took this saying from the Jews. The Jews acctually believed that all things were words of God. The Jewish people say that the world is 'God breathed'. So Christians just took this idea and limited it to their book in order to trap, scare and guilt people into only following their book and their way of looking at it. Which of course is a bizzare, sick and twisted version of what Jesus was actually trying to say!

I'm not a Dr. but this is what I do and it really works for me, specially if I'm in the office. I would suggest to do some pressure on your hands between your thumb and your forefinger. Right there in the middle of these two fingers there is a spot that when pressure is made helps to relief the headache. Do this until the pain get less and less. Besides this you might also need to rest (no computer, TV, read, etc) Try to close your eyes and focus on the colors you may see when your eyes are closed. Hope this help!

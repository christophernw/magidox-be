First plug in your PSP with a USB cable. Then turn on your PSP, go to settings, and there it should say "USB CONNECTION". Click on that and your PSP should connect to your computer. Then, on your computer, go to Windows Explorer. Go to all the drives (C - Local Disk, D - CD Drive, etc.), and it should say "PSP" on one of the drives. Open up that drive, then there should be a folder called "PSP". Open up that folder and there should be a folder called "MUSIC". Put all of your music into that folder (drag and drop). Make sure all of your music files are either MP3, WMA, or WAV.. . Good Luck!

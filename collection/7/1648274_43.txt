Yes, I was in 8th grade and there were a double level stair case that my friends and I went down every day, well one day we decided it would be a "GOOD" idea to jump over the barrier wall to the bottom level. Needless to say when I did it my right ankle rolled and broke. It sucked to go down those stairs the entire rest of the year.

The eye of the beholder is the only thing that makes a difference.. "Insurgents" is a term used for people fighting their own legitimate gouvernment, in the case of Iraq a very questionable term.. "Resistance fighters" can use terror as a method, as the IRA in Northern Ireland will tell you, but it is only a term to be used if you agree with the goals of the respective group.. So the Palestinians are freedom /resistance fighters in the eyes of nearly everybody in the Arab world, terrorists in the eyes of the West. . My own view is that if the occupying army has not the slightest regard for your human rights you are entitled to fight them with every means you have got.. Israel is a terrorist state, killing people on suspicion, regardless of innocent bystanders; and the really sad thing is that the US could curb them if they wanted to, but they won't.

I know I'm repeating some of what is said above, but i can give a clearer picture.. . In the centre of the sun, not the shell, the pressure and temperature is very great.  The sun is made up of 75% hydrogen, which under these conditions can undergo nuclear fusion via the proton-proton chain, to give a helium nucleus, neutrinos and high frequency radiation.. . As the radiation makes its way to the surface of the sun it undergoes processes called absorption and emission, that cause new frequencies of radiation, so that by the time it takes them to reach the surface (about a million years) some of them as in the visible region, and we can see them as light, so it shines.. . The sun will continue to be as we know it for around another 5 billion years, at which point it will leave the main sequence and continue its evolution.

I wouldn't say anybody conquers anybody in that regard. Greeks had their colossal and magnificent statues, but Romans had their artistic buildings and inventions like aquaduct etc. Greeks had so many philosophy works while Romans would stop at nothing for luxury and power. I think both ancient worlds had done beyond what we in the modern world could achieve using our modern tools!

"When there is will there's a way".  If people are desperate enough to get here they will.  A fence won't stop them if the threat of death won't (the desert).  Politicians need to throw the rednecks a bone though.  So the fence will be built and it will be a waste of money, but it will give people in Nebraska piece of mind, that THEIR country is not being "invaded".

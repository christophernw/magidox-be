Not only is this question stupid but it is short sighted too. Christmas has become nothing more than a way for businesses to exploit the American people. It is a commercialized holiday that has lost ALL of its true meaning. How can anyone respect a holiday that is supposed to celebrate the birth of the Christian Savior yet is focused solely on which business can make a larger income. How perverted is that? I would guess Jesus is laughing his butt off about how commercial and cutthroat the holiday to support His birth has become.

motivation is extremely important because it enables us to persist in working hard and to fully maintain or prolong our levels of energy and concerntration to the maximum. if we don't feel motivated in ourselves or we lack motivation in carrying out certain tasks or to go about doing things, then it implies to us that we aren't ready or don't feel ready to do so. it is only by lacking the hunger, belief, perserverance and desire, that difficulties arise later on and if they are not addressed immediately as we try to encounter and address those problems and to take matters into our own hands.

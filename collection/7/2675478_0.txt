I am a runner, and I'm not sure if this will make them small but to make them look better and more toned is you get some weights like a weight bar and stand on something stable that is lifted and raise your calves. They're called calf raises. Basically your standing on your tippy toes and then lowering your heels past the botton of the stable landing your standing on.

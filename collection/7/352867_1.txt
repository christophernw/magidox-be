DNA can be detected through blood, semen, saliva & RNA (a lesser form of DNA), can also be detected through the hair.. . If you are HIV positive & want to have a child (or if you are already pregnant), you will need to speak to a Dr to determine if you will automatically transfer HIV on to your child. I know they can do an amniocentesis  or invitro testing (in the womb) to determine genetic malfunctions. I know that the preferred choice of birth is caecerean section. I'm an RN but I'm not even sure of this answer, so I would hate to tell you one thing and then find out later I was wrong. Hope you get the answer you need, but don't rely on this forum, rely on a Dr's advice, instead. Okay? Good luck.

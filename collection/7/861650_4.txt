I don't know all the side effects but my grandma has diabetes and she has to keep her blood sugar up and has to eat at a certain time. My stepdad is in nursing school and said that people who have diabetes have to watch their toes because they get this thing I don't know what it is but it can get so bad that they will have to get their toe(s) amputated.

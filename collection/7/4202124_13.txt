It's a fact that Jesus made Catholicism. It's a fact that man made every other religion because they were too proud to accept what Jesus told them. It's a fact that the theory of evolution is fake. It has been debunked on every level. Single cell organisms cannot magically turn into mutiple cell organisms. That is a scientific law. Which means fact. If we descended from apes or gorillas, (as stated in evolutionism) why do we still have apes and gorillas, they should have turned into people by now. It is a fact that I'm right. It is fact that your wrong, probably about most things that you've ever try to speak intellegently on.

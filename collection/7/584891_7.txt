JK Rowling has promised to answer this question for the readers on HP book 7, along with the big one of why did Dumbledore trust Snape in the first place.. . There are two main schools of thought amongst fans:  he was following Dumbledore's orders OR he hated the professor so much that he seized his opportunity for revenge.  The first one is supported by Dumbledore's trust on Snape; the second one by the look of intense hatred on Snape's face when he killed Dumbledore and the Unbreakable Vow he made to Draco's mother, Narcissa.. . There are other possibilities like, he wanted to become Voldemort's most trusted follower, or his hatred of Harry is so great that he killed the only person who could protect him well.. . Ms. Rowling has said that we will find out about Snape and someone who loved him, and has mentioned that his life shows a pattern of redemption, but then again, he hasn't necessarily acted like a boy scout, has he?. . Anyway, the answer to your question will have to wait until that last book is finished.  In the meantime, whatever we say is pure speculation but...isn't it fun to guess?

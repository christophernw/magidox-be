Just a remark, that is probably not the kind of answer you expect: I don't understand how a team playing in just a national championship (same for NBA) can be declared as "World Champions". The fact USA probably think having the best teams (in these sports) in the world can't erase humility, and saying that without letting the opportunity of being challenged, that means you didn't understand anything to what sport is!!

The biggest reason isn't because we have bad choices, it's because we don't fully understand what our choices are. We see the ads, but they're confusing and biased. We could do a lot of research to find out who really represents our values, but that takes time. Instead, people decide not to decide. They tell themselves it doesn't really affect them, they're all a bunch of politicians, they don't really represent me, etc. It's not true. It DOES affect you. There may not be a single candidate who represents you 100%, but it's better to choose one that represents you 60% than one who is 90% against your beliefs. . . If more people knew about ways to identify the candidates that agree with their beliefs (without a lot of effort), I think they might be willing to take the time to vote. . . There's an excellent website called On The Issues that has a Senate Match Quiz - you choose your state and then answer 20 questions and it tells you which candidates most closely match your views. If you don't understand an issue, click on it to read a detailed explanation.  The Senate Match Quiz is in the top left corner of the page at the link below. . . If you want to spend a little more time and read about the candidates, click your state on the map.. . Another reason is that they don't know what they need to do - do they have to register first? Where do they do that? What documents do they have to take? Where do they vote? What do they need to take there? All of these can be answered easily by calling your local courthouse, but it's intimidating for some people, so they just don't.

they only look at the adult stuff if you are over 18 . i was a recruiter for the navy for 4 years. if youre under 18 let youre recruiter know . but chanses are they already know about it depending how far you are in the process. they will waiver anything but a hard core felony at meps. dont join the army go navy at least ya get good food and you sleep in a nice rack every night

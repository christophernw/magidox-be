You could also read books that could give you good ideas.. . I recommend "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie or look around Amazon here:. . http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684868016/ref=pd_sim_b_1/103-5351259-9854203?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=283155. . I would also say, "just be a good listener".

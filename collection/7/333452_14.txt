Probably because nobody is teaching kids to care about it anymore.  Kids think it's cool to be ignorant and embarrassing to be smart in public.  Parenting and teaching get so little effort and less attention then ever.  I see it every day at work.  I'm surrounded by upper level managers who can't spell, can't construct a proper sentence, can't use more than two fingers to type, yet brag of their college degrees.

Its easy.  But you have to plan for it on the potty in the morning with a piece of toilet paper and pen (the real one).  . . - List the pending jobs that you could not finish last week.. - Jot down names of people you need to make official calls to and the reasons. - Have an idea of what new thing you could do that would enhance your performance and benefit the company.. - Make a note of any important personal work that may be on your mind, but that you keep forgetting while at work.. - Carefully fold the piece of toilet paper and tuck it in your shirt pocket or bra and be sure you dont wipe your a** with it.. - Clean yourself and get fresh. - Go to your dresser and put the piece of paper in your handbag or wallet or trouser pocket.. - Go to work with a bounce. - Take out the paper as soon as you touch your table and go!

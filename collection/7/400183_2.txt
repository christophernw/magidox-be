No one knows. But one reason is relieving a very full bladder when you are dying to pee. It upsets the equilibrium of the body. That includes the nervous system. People are even known to pass out when they finally get to go after waiting a long time to empty a bursting bladder.. . A lot of people take a long time to start their pee stream after holding their pee too long. "Here I am bursting and not a drop comes out." I have found that a scary situaltion after a long car trip without any rest stops because the driver has a huge bladder. It is difficult to relax the muscles used to hold back  your piss for a long time.. .  I am not talking about the morning erection which also can do that. . . Anyway the bladder and the body are inseparable and sensitive.

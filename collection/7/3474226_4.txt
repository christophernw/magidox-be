You can use Sheer Cover or Sudden Glow which was on TV recently.  It is a very lightweight powder which you apply on your face with a powder brush like make-up.  To eliminate the problem, you can see a dermatologist to remove the red skin with laser.  It is quite expensive, and I don't know if insurance pays for this.  It might be a little bit painful like getting a needle shot.

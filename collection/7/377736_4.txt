If you are exercising a lot, you could be gaining muscle mass.  Muscle weighs more than fat...Other than that, I'm not sure what to tell you.  Get a body fat percentage done, to see where you're at.  I do know this, though:  Not eating a lot is a bad idea.  If you eat a lot of small meals in a day, it will help raise your metabolism and help you lose weight.  Not eating much just slows it down.  Just make sure it's healthy food in smaller portions.

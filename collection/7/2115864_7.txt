I think others have said basically the same thing, but it's important to get a crate only big enough for your dog to stand up, and lay down in.  If he has any more room then that he will relieve himself on one side, and sleep on the other.  A dog HATES to sleep in it's waste, so will avoid doing so if at all possible.. . It's also very important to make sure you take the dog out to potty before putting him to bed.  Cut down or better yet eliminate snacks/treats at least 2 hours before bedtime. A schedule is a good thing to get your dog used to.. . My dog is fed at 6:00 a.m. and at 6:00 p.m. every day.  It's a schedule he knows, and looks forward to.  It also gives him time to digest his food, and eliminate before bedtime.. . Also, I know it's tempting sometimes to rub your dogs nose in it's poop. But, your dog doesn't understand why you are doing this to him.  It's cruel, and doesn't teach your dog anything except that he must fear you.. . Above all, be patient. You dog will learn, you just have to find out what works for him, and you.

There are 2 days which use the term Easter-Easter Sunday and Easter Monday (the day after 'Easter').  Although the Sunday is always the day that Easter itself is actually celebrated, the Monday is often a holiday.  Maybe you should try looking at it another way, rather than the term Easter Sunday describing Easter as being on a Sunday, it may be describing a Sunday which is Easter as no other Sundays in a year are ever Easter. Thats 2 different perspectives to consider it from.

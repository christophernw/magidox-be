Racism is everywhere! Why, because we have really screwed up people in the world who have absolutely no clue what they are speaking about. As far as UDA's (UNDOCUMENTED ALIENS) they are breaking the law. Virtually every UDA that we encouter has a social security card in their possession..you know who it belongs to? A U.S. Citizen somewhere! Ya know what happens when the USC wants to start collecting...they get screwed because the UDA has already started collecting the money for them...Identity theft is out of control and the UDA's are going to destroy the social security system and put us in the poor house, not to mention costing us tax payers billions of dollars in unpaid medical expenses. The days of opening our borders to anyone and everyone has got to be re-examined, we need to think about our children and how they will be affected.

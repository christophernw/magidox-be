RadioShack will have the wire and accessories you would need.  I don't think they sell books any more but the people who work there might help you with the information - it's fairly straightforward.. . If the people at one branch don't know, it's worth visiting more branches, you're sure to find someone who does.  . . Look for information in your public library too.

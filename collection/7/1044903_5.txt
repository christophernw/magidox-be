Plan for it - timing is everything.  Have a nice supper, maybe a glass of wine, listen to some music, have a good laugh and when the moment is right say, 'There is something VERY important that I need to tell you...'  You must let them know.  You shouldn't have to deal with this by yourself.. All the best.  I'll think of you.

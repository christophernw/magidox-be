Go to dealer, if you have another key, bring with so they could read the chip. If you don't have another key then you need to bring proof that the car is your and ID. You might also need the new key programmed to the car (I can't remember for sure). good luck. Jammy275 15+ GM tech, ASE master tech, and former automotive teacher

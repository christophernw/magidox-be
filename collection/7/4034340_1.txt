I am a grade 12 chemistry student. I do not know the chemical formula of carrot actually. Still, all the organic chemical involved C, H and sometimes O. The flame actually provide energy to do a forward combustion reaction. Combustion mean burn. The basic formula is:. CH4+2(O2)->CO2+2(H2O). Although the chemical reaction in reality would be much more complicated but actually it based on the same idea as the formula above. Which is the Oxygen gas in the air combined with the carbon in the carrot form carbon dioxide, also with the Hydrogen form water vapour. That's also explain why wwe can't burn without oxygen(air).

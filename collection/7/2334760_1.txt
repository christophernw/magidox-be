You need satellite reception - which means a satellite dish being fitted to your building - probably best to get a local firm to do it.. You can buy satellite receivers from time to time in LIDL or ALDI - the last two I bought cost me about £25 each. These are NOT SKY boxes - just a plain satellite receiver - but you don't need to buy an expensive one.. You will need a large dish (see web site link in sources below) - not less than 60 cm but preferably 80 cm - so you will have to buy it out there unless you drive out - in which case watch out for the LIDL offers - complete systems for under £50 or so. LIDL are at http://www.lidl.co.uk/uk/home.nsf/pages/i.home - but no offers on at the mo that I can find.. You will get all the free channels broadcast from the ASTRA 2 satellite at 28.2 degrees east. Details available on the web - see source below.. These include many British channels but NOT Channels 4 and 5. You can also get some German, French, Italian and other channels and lots of radio channels as well.. You don't need any cards for the reception, and all these costs are one-off up front costs - no subscription etc to pay. Just the electricity for the TV and sat receiver.

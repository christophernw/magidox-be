Everyone acts strangely during sex.  That is, in fact, normal during sex.  Not acting strange is a sign that one is not involved in the process.  None of the behaviors you describe are particularly bizarre at all.. . The real question is:  does sex with each other satisfy each of you?  Because if her behaviors turn you off--or if you are not affirming her and validating her in her own sexual needs--then that's something to work on if you want to save the relationship, or else find someone else.  She is entitled to enjoy sex fully, just as you are; her pleasure, however dissimilar it might be to your a priori mental picture of how a woman should act during sex, should be a very high priority for you in sex.

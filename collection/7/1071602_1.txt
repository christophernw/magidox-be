I would request a meeting with the principle, teacher & my child to get to the bottom of it. No teacher has the right to lay their hands on your kid unless you gave the school permission to do so. If the principle will not do anything about it, then take it up to the school board. Also speak with your child & let him know that he handled the situation wrong by giving the instructor attitude. He/She's got to learn that you can't do that in the REAL WORLD. When there's a problem on the job you go talk with your boss/supervisor like an adult. Regardless, if the boss is in the wrong you don't give them attitude. He/She's got to learn to respect authority.

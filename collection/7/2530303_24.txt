ill tell you why i did it..... i was in a relationship with a man, who knocked me up. on accident enev though i was on the pill.. He was living with his ex and never would commit to me..... if i woulda had that baby, it would be starving right now because it wouldnt have a dad to help pay for its food and im just some 21 yr old trying to get on my own feet.. if i woulda had that baby, it woulda suffered its whole life because of me....so if anything, i was NOT selfish, at least i didnt want to ruin a childs life..... and i do feel sad about it very often....i would never even do it again, but I look back and still know that is the right deciosn

Paranoid Schizophrenia.....in my opinion...I have had experience working with such people with this diagnosis and they are in hell...confused, unpredictable, dangerous, compulsive.... . worst emotional anguish is to lose the person who is supposed to nurture you (a parent)I suppose.. . Also to lose faith in your religion

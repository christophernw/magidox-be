The water's in a vapor form which makes it much much lighter than if it were in liquid form, and there are air currents within clouds that keep the vapor circulating around and are able to hold the water up against gravity.  It's when water vapor starts forming droplets that it gets too heavy for clouds and we get rain, hail, etc.

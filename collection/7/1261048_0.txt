well i would tell my teen i want him/her to be active if he/she is unwilling to find things on there own then there is always cleaning the garage/ basement/attic. yard work washing your car getting in fire wood or plowing the north 40. i am sure after some labor they will be more than willing to find things like sports ect to fill there time. if not well then wow look at all the work you got done around the house, and hey if they like doing those things i know a young man who bought his first car and paid some of his clothing costs doing odd jobs.

I try to explain this to my patients every day..... . A strength is something that comes from within, a personal characteristic/trait that leads you in a positive direction (such as I'm strong-willed, determined, I have a great personality, etc). Whereas a skill is something that you can do in which you are good at (i.e. I type 90 words a minute, I'm a successful writer, I paint murals, I can peel a banana with my toes, etc)....

precum is a lubricating fluid, clear, thin & just like vaginal mucus. Precum contains little if any viable sperm.  Precum is NOT Semen.. . it ooozes out from many young guys' pricks once they're hard and serves to wet the female for entry.   animals ooze this out also.   And precum happens to taste delicious, I might add.  . . Premature ejaculation is the actual come - the prostatic fluid with loads of sperm in it.   this is the real deal.  This is thick, whitish, cloudy opalescent pearly white or yellowish as the guy ages.. this does not taste so good.  . . I know since I'm a gourmet  connoisseur of both precum & semen.  Younger guys taste the best -  Yummy,  Yummy

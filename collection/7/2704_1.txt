I know exacty what your saying and it is so sad that people are like that. Some men are so blind and don't know their left hand from the right. A lot guys are plain stupid when it comes to relationships. They have no clue. . I believe a man should look deeper into a woman, I mean, like their personality should mean something to them, besides the looks. . . Its too bad a lot of guys are like that. Love is Blind. . . Good Luck and I believe you will find the right man some day. It might take you awhile but he's out there looking for you right now. Stay positive and be proud of yourself.

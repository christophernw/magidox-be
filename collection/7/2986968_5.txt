The EU has already surpassed America in greatness. The world disrespects america to a great extent, if you didn't get the memo.  Europe is light years ahead of us. The EU will likely not possess the otherworldly, warmongering, imperialistic intentions that the US has. So in that regard I guess you could say the US is 'supreme'.

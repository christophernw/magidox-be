Stress coat and Stress zyme are two of the best aquarium products I`ve ever used.Stress coat gives a protective slick coat to your tank and fish,and Stress zyme will keep the tank and water clean for a LONG time if you follow the directions.I only had to change one fourth of the water once a week and add fresh water,then the Stress zyme.It would be a month or more before i had to clean the entire tank.Try that product,I honestly believe it will solve the problem.You can find it in the pet store,but even Wal-Mart carries it!Don`t buy any other brand.When I tried something else I killed some fish.

the reason is because there are amps already in your car and the radio puts out only a tiny amount of electric and the amps do the rest. If you were to hook a regular head unit to the inputs on the stock amps you would fry them instantly. it is possible to change the head unit but it is expensive and also a pain in the a$$ to get all the wiring out and new wires ran.

Well the obvious one is that there is silicone in fake boobs and actual breast tissue in real boobs.  If you want to be able to tell the difference, say if you're looking at a person and you're wondering if they're fake or not, usually they will be more perky if they are fake.  They will also stick out more near the tops.  They might be unproportioned to the person's body too.  For example a really skinny girl might have fake big boobs, but that might just be genetics.  These are just guidelines, some people just have natrually big and perky boobs.

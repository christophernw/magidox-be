Meat doesn't actually have a lot of "flavor".  For the obligate carnivore such as a cat or other feline it is life.  They don't eat it for the flavor.. . Even humans will say rabbit or rattlesnake "tastes like chicken".. Hundreds of thousands years ago human learned that cooking meat gave it a great taste.  We like sweet things and cooking carmelizes meat and makes it taste better to us.  Also we like salt on our food.  Salt was important to man as a preservative for meat and to add flavor.  It was highly prized along with other spices.  The expression "worth his salt" and the word salary comes from the root for salt as people would actually be paid in salt as well as currency.. . Cats are much more attracted to smell than taste which is why they like fish.  The flavoring in cat food is there more for human appeal (even though they don't eat it).

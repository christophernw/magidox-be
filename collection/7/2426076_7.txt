don't yell at her! she won't understand why you're yelling. ignoring her when she does this and praising her when she's laying down and being quite will help reinforce the quiet behaviour. also you could think about dropping her at a doogie daycare for a few hours a day a couple of times a week. most people i talk to say their dogs are pooped after playing at daycare. also some agility classes would benefit your dog and keep her mind active. or you could try getting some toys that you can hide food in like kongs. you can also get hollow balls and put their breakfast in it and as your dog plays with the ball and it rolls around it drops out peices of food and keeps her entertained.

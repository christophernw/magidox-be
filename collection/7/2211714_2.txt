The MRT which is inpunctual even though the clock there already state the time of the arriving time of the train. Most of the time you have to wait for a few minutes. . . Get cheat by the taxi drivers(i mean in KL). They raise the amount of the meter before the passenger get inside the taxi. If they don't do that, they'll not follow the meter and set the fee by themself.

Politics empowers the statesmen as it gives them power.It is just natural tendency to abuse and misuse this power.Once in power the politician enjoys status and influence.People fawn over these people in order to get a favour.Also most of these elected politicians election campaign have been funded by lobbyists and mafia dons.Hence these politicians are bound to repay thses crooks for getting them elected.There is a nexus these days and this vicious cirlce will never end unless the aspect of money does not stop playing such an important role in the field of politics.

Christmas in its original form was not religious. There was a period during the Middle Ages when the Church banned celebration of Yule (the predecessor of Christmas) because it was Pagan. Then they figured the only way to convert everyone was to borrow local customs and modify them to suit their purposes. Thus the religion of Christmas originated. Then it was banned again in the Colonial times by the Puritans for the exact same reasons. . . That said, non-religious folks have every right to celebrate Christmas if they so choose and no one has the right to take that away from them.

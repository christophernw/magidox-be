If your an established writer, you might want to consider getting an agent. If you got one you might want to fire him (LOL). If your not established, you might want to check out some government grants that are available to help you out while your writing a book, novel, poem, or whatever you write. Working online as a writer takes a little work. Unless your established, you can't really work online without a butt-load of experience. Most employers check to see your previous work ethic as an in-house writer. This will help them determine whether or not to let you write off-site. They may also tell you to write for about 2-3 weeks from home and then come back. This will allow them to test whether or not they can trust you working alone. I know I didn't answer your question directly but I hope this helps!

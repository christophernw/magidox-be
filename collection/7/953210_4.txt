Entropy is always positive by the definition of entropy. Entropy is always increasing for another reason. It's all statistics.. . Here is the idea: entropy is loosely described as the disorder in a system. This is not its definition. Its definition is the mathematical one given by Boltzmann. Despite this, you can appeal to the "order" non-description.. . Consider a chamber of gas separated into two parts by some partition. One part contains 1000 atoms of some gas and the other contains 1000 atoms of a different gas. Now we raise the partition and let the gasses mix. I think we can agree that totally mixed gasses are more disordered than totally unmixed gasses, so the disorder goes up. The question is this. What is the chance, if the atoms are moving kind of randomly, that you put the partition down and the atoms are totally separated again?. . The answer is 2*(1/2)^2000, which is a number so small that my calculator undoubtedly cannot give me an answer for it.. . Now most systems in the world have many, many more parts than this, so there is a possibility that entropy will decrease, that the mixed gasses will randomly separate, but one thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand does not begin to describe the number of particles in the world, much less the universe. The odds are so far against it that we call it a law of nature and move on.. . For the record, if the system were made up of two particles, the odds of entropy decreasing would be very significant.

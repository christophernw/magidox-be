it sounds discusting, but my boyfriend likes a home remedy of lime, garlic and water. heat it up and drink like a tea.. . I advise you to add some sugar!. . drink before bed and then put on lots of covers so you sweat..  if you dont like natural, there are lots of over the counter brands you can take to relieve the symptoms, just read the box that fits the symptoms you have. I like thera-flu. It also heats up like hot lemon and I think it relieves the symptoms well. they have different kind for different symptoms. I added a site for you to look at for natural remedies. . Remember! f you get worse or your cold wont go away, see a doctor!!

speaking from experience..i broke my leg in 2 place and my wrist in 9 during the same accident.I was out of work for 6 months..i waited and rested as told but also kept stretching and flexing my foot and hand to keep things in motion. if you have had it immobilized for this entire time it will take some rehab.. you may also look at the possibility that your hooked on your pain meds. they will trick your brain into thinking your in pain just so you'll take more. Be careful and good luck

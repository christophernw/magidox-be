What happens when we die? where do we go? is there life after death? do you believe in a god? Those are just a few questions that will ALWAYS be asked by the enquiring mind that can never be answered with any degree of certainty. Which is why they will always be asked. If the answers were known then the questions wouldnt be asked and it is this fear of the unknown, rather than death, that naturally worries people. I myself cannot comprehend the concept of infinity or the theory that existence had a starting point. How existence has no starting point, and therefore no beginning is beyond me. Even further beyond me is the theory that existence magically appeared from nothing. The big bang theory can only take us so far back in time, it cannot tell us what was there before. NOTHING?? What is nothing? Off the point a bit maybe? As i said before, it is the fear of the unknown rather than the fear of death.

Any substance which can affect mood or metabolism should be avoided by people with bi-polar disorder. There is a history of manic depression in my family and we have learned to stay away from medicines/herbs that can affect the central nervous system. You had a manic reaction already. Members of my family have totally 'wigged'. It is not to be taken lightly, actually, because consequences of herbs/medications on bi-polar disorder are dangerous and can have serious effects. Good luck !

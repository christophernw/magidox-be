because it would be soo easy to make counterfeits, like 12 year old liks could do it prolly.  then government would go bankrupt and the world would end as we know it, and thats if we're lucky.  AHHH!!! haha i don't wanna think about it.... why do you think the government is always adding seemingly useless things on the new bills? - to make it harder and harder to counterfeit.  it's a huge busines counterfeiting, and theres like literally billions upon billions of dollars floating around that the U.S never made.  yeahh nuff said : p

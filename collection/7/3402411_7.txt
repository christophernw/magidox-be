I really mean it when i say it but others... that can mean omg what the hell did I just do. lol... if u are really wondering what the person meant, ask them. Communication has always been the best way to do anything. See if they really wanna get together. Make the 1st move, dont wait till they do. Invite them on an outing.. . Okay, If a girl said that to you, talk to her and ask her if she would like to go out again. invite her to go to a movie, or out to dinner, or even out for a nice walk. If she says yes, then u know she likes you. If she puts you off (meaning says no then ask her if there is something that she would like to do with you and have her pick what she wants to do) if she still says no, then move on. She is not into you or maybe she just would rather be friends.

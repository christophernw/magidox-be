(Disclaimer: this is from a theatre perspective, but I suspect the experience wouldn't be too far off for TV acting.). . First of all, get trained. Many actor-hopefuls stumble blindly into auditions without a proper insight into what is really expected of them. After you've gained more confidence, audition like there's no tomorrow! Or sign on with an agency (assuming they don't take a ridiculous commission) or repertory company.. . If you can't afford training, at least try to find a friend who's an experienced professional and get an honest opinion from them on where you stand, what is expected of you, and what you can do to up your chances of getting hired or improve your craft.. . Acting is hard work and takes a lot of mental resilience and focus. If you're in it for the passion, the hard work won't be a deterrent. If you're in it for the attention and fame...good luck.

I use the Witches Pendulum, it is quick and easy to use..   Just take a can, or bowel, a piece of rough string about7 or 8 inches long, and a small stone; tie the stone with the string, hold it in the center of the bowel. Hold the string with your two fingers making sure that your elbow isn't resting on any thing, then ask it questions. Left for yes, right for no, and around and round if you don't know..  Ask it a question and it will answer you by hitting the side of the bowel with the stone.. . Witch craft 101

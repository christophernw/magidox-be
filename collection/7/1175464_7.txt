When I'm interviewing and I ask those questions, in weaknesses, I'm looking for what that person thinks is a professional weakness but also what ideas they have thought about to overcome that weakness and make it a positive or asset. . . With strengths, I'm wondering what traits, qualities or skills you're bringing to the table and why you feel they're assets, both for the company and for yourself.. . There's really not a right or wrong answer for either but I'm looking for someone who can have confidence in themselves. Everyone has weaknesses so I worry if someone can't come up with one or two. Someone who can lists more weaknesses than strengths or who can't back up either one in a positive manner is probably going to go to the end of my list however. to me that shows lack of confidence or the person is underselling themselves to me.

Some (not all) states have laws that protect the purchaser of a new vehicle from getting a 'lemon'.  It only applies to new cars, you have to give the dealer opportunity to fix it, and it has to be essentially the same problem each time that they can't fix properly.  Then and only then can you be compensated for your trouble.

Right and wrong are defined in terms of the society they happen in. People are taught from an early age (both directly and indeirectly) that certain specific behaviors, veiwpoints, and statements are right or wrong. When people from two cultures with a different defintions of right and wrong meet... things get interesting. (see all of human history for examples)

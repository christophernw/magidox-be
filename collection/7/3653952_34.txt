SO many of the answers here show people's complete ignorance.  The insinuation that the confederate flag is a symbol of slavery is preposterous.  I won't go into the details of why, because that is not what your question is about.  I think that your question is completely valid and neither rude nor ignorant.  During Reconstruction, display of the flag was illegal in states occupied by federal troops.  I believe that people fly the flag today for the same reason that people display their family crest, or tartan.  As for being afraid, I think that's understandable.  It sounds as though you are coming from a totally different frame of reference, and that's ok.  There is a certain stigma surrounding the Confederate Flag, but ultimately, I think we should respect each others' differences and not look down on someone because they know and care where they came from.  People joke about the Civil War all the time, and I think to a certain degree it burns Southerners more, but of course it would, they got their asses handed to them.  So can't we be a wee bit gracious and allow them to fly a flag to honor the men and boys that died without calling them names?  If the answer is no then you are more ignorant than any redneck, hick or hillbilly I've ever met.  Tolerance, remember?  Even if you don't agree.  And just for the record there were people in the North who didn't want slavery abolished either.  Good ol' Abe himself just wanted to ship every black person back to Africa, and the Union, after the war, turned black men only into second-class citizens.  Wake up people, racism wasn't limited to below the Mason-Dixon line.

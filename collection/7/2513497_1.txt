It is a buyer's market right now.  This doesn't mean that seller's are giving away their houses just that there are more houses on the market.  There may be price changes due to market adjustments depending on the area you live in. . . Low balling an offer is not wise.  The seller may decide to ignore your offer, not counter, and not accept any future offers from you. Working with a buyer's agent is best since they can assist you with the offer price and conditions, run comparable prices for the area, review time on market, see if listings have changed agency and pricing, and manage the process.  You can get a good price but the seller has an agenda also.  They have certain expectations for the sale of the home which may include the mortgage payoff and money towards a new home.. . Good Luck,

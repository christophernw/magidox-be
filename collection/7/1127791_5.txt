You cruel person, you do not deserve to keep fish! No innocent fish deserves to die because you don't like them. Your goldfish can live for decades if kept in a pond, or a huge aquarium. You need a nice cycled tank, with adequate filtration, heating, and all other essentials. In hopes that u have a conscience, and after reading some of the saddist comments here (flush it down the toilet, really!) I would refer u here http://www.fishforums.net/. Other wise stop killing fish you murdurer!. PS: How would you like it if you nearly starved for a year? Two weeks is the max but a year?

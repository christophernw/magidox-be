I have 18 Chihuahuas here and as you may guess not everyone is housebroken...(a breed problem)...I have a carpet washer and I add 1/4 cup of color safe bleach to the gallon bottle that attaches to the machine...I do not add any soaps. I go over my carpets once a week...and I can't tell you how many people have come in and said OMG how can you have NEW carpets with all these dogs and no smell in your house...lol. My carpets are 4 years old.. Nature Miracle is a product lots of my fellow breeders use to remove single stains and they love it.. I'm sticking to my bleach...lol

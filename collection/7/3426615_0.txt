a bike is only as good as the service the place u bought it from provides....i've got a 04 speed triple special edition and i think triumphs are well thought out and as long the dealership doesn't forget why they are in business its a good deal. in response to hearing triumphs are expensive...well the reason i bought one intially was because it was all could afford at the time...went in too look and saw the speed triple they had just knocked 2000 off so i got a bike worth a little over 10k out the door for 8344.00 and now two years later retail is 7900.00 so i think it was fairly priced...they only drawback is the dealers are few and far between....so good dealer service is important...i've been lucky so far...lol...the most expensive thing about the whole bike was the 12k valve check etc.... later. . ps..the bike has been one of the most reliable and fun bikes with a unique heritage for low cost...i highly reccomend a triumph...the only thing that took some getting used to was the torque and the seat...lol...

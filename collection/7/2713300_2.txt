YOU ARE PRETTY and you yourself have to know it. Well in loving another person it should start first by loving yourself FIRST. You are unique from hte others and you instill a unique beauty among the others. I guess when you start to love yourself more, it will reflect and people will see that in you and will have to give the same love you are giving yourself. Try it just my 2cents. I hope i helped.

gas prices differ most likely because the gas stations may be part of the same company but the gas staions have been franchised so the gas stations are owned by different people so there is always the distinct possibility that prices will not be the same. . there is also the possibility that they could get there gas in different amounts which would drive up or down the price and also the quality is dependant upon the price

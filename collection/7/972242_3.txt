This problem has been going on for years. The Al Gores of the world won't let us build new refineries or open up our oil wells we already have in this country. We may need an alternative but until then we need to use our own resource of oil. Congress must vote on this and they have and the majority of the votes were against it so therefore we have to pay the price.

We do that because our brains are moving faster than our mouths & we're constantly thinking farther ahead of what we're saying so we wind up umm-ing & ah-ing in order to try & catch back up to where we are in what we're saying. Try speaking a tad more slowly so that you can constantly keep up to what you're saying & what you're going to say next. Make sure that you don't go too slow though or else you'll start to forget what you were going to say next. It's best to have an outline mentally prepared in your head already & try sticking to that path so as to get to the point you're trying to make before you begin second guessing yourself & start trying to adapt what you're currently saying cuz then you'll really confuse the crap outta yourself & start the ums & ahs all over again

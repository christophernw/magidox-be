At the time of this answer, it's been 6/6/06 in Australia for approximately 8 hours (depending on which province you're looking at). Since Australia seems to be pretty much intact, life going on as per usual, etc., I think I'll just make plans to go to work tomorrow.. . Also, if you know of a place in the middle of a dessert, I hope it's not chocolate. With the summer temperatures, it'll probably melt, and you'll drown. If you're headed to the desert, on the other hand, I suggest you take some water.

I'm going to assume that you saw that on TV or something like that. Saying what time a TV show is coming on. The east coast of the US is in one time zone--Eastern Standard Time--and right west of that is the Central Time Zone (CT), running one hour behind. But they're on the same television schedules, so if a show starts at 9 o'clock on Monday, they'll say that it's playing Monday at 9, and 8 o'clock Central (because of the time difference). ... . . Monday 9/8 CT.. . As for the time difference, I think Singapore is 13 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time (the 9 part of the 9/8 CT). So, looks like 10 o'clock Tuesday morning for you.

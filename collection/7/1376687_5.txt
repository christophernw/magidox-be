The problem with observing something n the moon, is the resolving power of the telescope. I'm not sure of the exact resoling power of the Hubble, I believe it to be 6 metres - meaning that anything under 6 metres would not be detectable.. . The problems of using earth bound telescopes, is our own atmosphere which causes distortion, thereby decreasing the telescopes resolving power.. . One other factor that should be kept in mind, is that most telescopes that would be sufficiently powerful - would find the luminosity of the moon too bright which could ruin the telescope by overheating and introducing aberrations (warps) into the mirror.

I've been into good music for a long-long time, and Ray Charles is in the "Rock & Roll" Hall of Fame, Cleveland, OH.  How do I know, I was there last Sat, 4 Feb 06.  I'm not that old but really enjoy some of the good musicians of their times, and Ray Charles was one of them. My father enjoyed Ray Charles a lot, and I heard him play his records all the time, then when I got older I actually listened to what Ray had to say, and his unnatural beat then got very interested in his music.  He was known as "the Genius Sings the Blues", and I think he deserved that title as much as James Brown is the "Father of Soul".  And this comes from an all-white female under 30 year of age.  Nuff said.

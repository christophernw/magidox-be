Because life sucks, and then mercifully you die, but the pessimists like to convince you that you're going to have eternal life and therefore actually you don't die, it just keeps on sucking, or if you're an optimist, you die and you cease to exist, and you're obviously not happy, because you have to exist to feel emotion, but you're not experiencing sadness, so you don't have to be miserable anymore.

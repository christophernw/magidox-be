Context....Pronunciation???  Christian....Sean...Shawn....Shian... not sure. I have recently seen this both as a given name (a friend's baby) along with online in text.. . Just based on the category it could possibly be that you are looking for the meaning of the Chinese name of a city.... . Xi'an (Chinese: 西安; Hanyu Pinyin: Xī'ān; Wade-Giles: Hsi-An; literal meaning: "Western Peace"; former name Sian), is the capital of Shaanxi province in China and a sub-provincial city. Known as one of the most important cities in Chinese history, Xi'an is listed as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China because it has been the capital of 13 dynasties, including the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang. Xi'an is also the eastern end of the Silk Road. The city has more than 3,100 years of history. It was called Chang'an (长安/長安 pinyin: Cháng'ān), meaning "Perpetual Peace", in ancient times.. . Xi'an is the largest and most developed city in the central to northwestern part of China and is ranked among the 10 largest cities in the nation.. . Otherwise, I would agree with the post about this as use of a shortcut.

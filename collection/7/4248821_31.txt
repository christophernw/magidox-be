I was raped when I was 17, now 22. I suggest that you go to the police station or your local clinic and tell them what had happened. You need to be STD/AIDS/HIV/Pregnancy tested as well. If you would have reported it after it happened they would have gotten more evidence. I'm surprised that none of your friends or family have said anything about your sudden weight loss and antisocialism.

Israels is the only Middle-Eastern nation which isn't Muslim.Not only that the Israelis hate their Muslim neighbours.The more aid the US gives Israel,the two become more chummy.So if the US gets into a conflict with one of Israel's neighbours (say Iran),Israel will gladly help out Uncle Sam.Not only that Israel buys a lot of military equipment from the US,so America gets its aid money back by selling arms to Israel.During the Cold War,Israel and Egypt were involved in a conflict called the 'Six Day War'.In this war,the USSR supported Egypt and the other Arab allies while Russia's Cold War rival America (naturally) supported Israel.this is how the two countries became friendly.Israel is also a strategically important nation,the US wants to station its troops there.All the more reason for Uncle Sam to stay best buddies with Israel.So a host of geo-political factors motivate America's friendliness with the Jewish State.But the main factor is that not only is Israel strategically located,they are non-Muslim AND they pretty much hate Muslims.Plus Isreal has good military strategies-even though the Isrealis were hopelessly outnumbered by the Egyptians in the Six-Day War,they won the conflict by occupying key positions like the Sinai Desert and the Golam Heights.So,the USA know that Israel will be a good military ally if the two have to team up against any other Muslim nation.Isreal spends an astounding amount of money on military hardware,and on developing nuclear weapons.

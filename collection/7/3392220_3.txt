Because 4 wheel drive means just that. All 4 wheels at some point will have engine power applied and the tires must be the same height (tire wear!) or the shorter (old) tires will spin at a different rate of speed than the taller (new) tires. This condition would cause excess wear on your powertrain, the differential used to actually turn the tires.

these days it is. it was set up as 2 parts of the same thing. like 1 company with 2 departments. the breakaway was to be the start of a new way of doing things, a radical change. the start of a new nation quickly became the start of a new power, not what it was intended to be. weve been screwed up ever since. now, by docile apathy weve demanded the very things we fought to break free of in the 1st place; socialized health care, taxes, communism, welfare for the rich & parasitic and kings instead of representitives.

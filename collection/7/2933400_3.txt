It's funny that you asked that...My fiancee who is Irish and has just come here to the states for the first time aked the samething. I told him it's just like news papers and such death,tragedy,and canage sell and bring in high ratings. Telling us we are too fat, too ugly, and too poor boosts sales of these products and that if we have this or that the one you like or love will want you more. I try only to watch the weather on the local news and avoid national news broadcasts for such a reason. I will read online the "Hot" topics and such to just keep aprised of whats going on. We besides the UK are the only ones who seem to always display death and distruction daily on the the news. Watch RTE1 the Irish goverment TV they cover what is relivent. The radio news will make a small blurb on beatings and killings but they done drone on about it and make you feel like you are not safe if you leave your house

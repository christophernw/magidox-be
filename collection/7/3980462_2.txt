A cloudbase forms when the temperature and dew point become the same temperature, approaching each other at a rate of 8 degrees C per 1000 m. The level at which they are equal is the condensation level, where relative humidity is 100% and clouds are able to form.. I won't get into how the clouds form, but because the condensation level will usually be a level surface, the bottoms of clouds tend to be flat (i.e. cumulus clouds).. As the saturated air rises and the cloud gets bigger, colder drier air gets mixed in with the cloud (entrainment) helping some of the cloud edges to evaporate. So this is why there is more of a puffyness to the cloud edges and top compared to the flat cloud base.

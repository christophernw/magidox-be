Okay...I have watched many labors and the cats ALWAYS licks the babies while she is in labor. This is essential because there may be mucus stuck up the babies nose and they may aspirate. She may not feed them until she is done...however if they do not get food after an hour you have to start feeding them or they may die. They need immediate nutrients.

It is bizarre. Oh, the world we live in.....!!. . But think about this one:. . Police catches the criminal, beats him to pulp. He can barely walk. Then, the police gets him into his cruiser. . . What does the police do at this point? Holds the criminal's head very carefully and guides him gently into the rear seat so that he won't bump his head against the roof of the car. . . Go figure.. . Here is another one: . . An inmate is in the deathrow. He was about to be put to death next day.  He has a heart attack the previous night. The jail warden rushes him to hospital, gives him all the medical assistance, revives him. Brings him in. Then gives him lethal to kill him. This has happened, I am not making this up.

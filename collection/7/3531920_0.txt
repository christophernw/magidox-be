Running, even only twenty minutes at a moderate pace will increase your metabolism. . And swimming, for... an hour or so, will increase your metabolism for more than 24 hours.. Research has also indicated that eating spicy foods may increase metabolism, as well as caffiene (but that's not too good...) and diet pills with epinephrine in them, I think.

That's budgie's way of showing you affection and he's trying to get your attention!! :)  I love it when my budgies do that to me.   . . Budgies also do that to their mate to show them affections. . . Watch out that he doesn't start regurgitating food to feed you. That's another way of showing that he loves you!!!

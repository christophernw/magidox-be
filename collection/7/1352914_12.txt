Any "filth" that may be associated with smoking cigarettes can never match the hate, anger, ignorance and disrespect that you've just sent out.  . Are you also protesting as strongly the pollution caused by vehicles, which I'd bet money you drive, factories, that produce products you buy, fast food chains, do you eat at them?  . In my neck of the woods, I am daily assaulted with the smells of the oil and gas industry,(folks keep telling me that's the smell of money--but I never see the dollars) it's so bad at times it wakes me in the middle of the night from a sound sleep.   There's also the stench of huge dairy farms, a cheese plant and a waste water treatment plant (all of which I'm told are also the smell of money).  And lets not forget the smell of traffic!  All of these things stink so bad they give me headaches.  I've never experienced that from someone smoking a cigarette.. On the ground, there are way more grocery bags, fast food wrappers, glass, cans and even used disposable diapers than cigarette butts!. Why so much hostility toward smokers?

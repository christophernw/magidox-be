Stars are not on fire. They are not burning (there is no oxygen in outer space you know). Nor do they create light by nuclear fusion.. . Stars give out light because they are hot. All hot bodies radiate light energy. The hotter they are the more light energy they radiate away, and the more blue the light is.. . Stars get hot because they form by particles falling onto them under gravity. The potential energy of the things that fall onto a forming star turns into kinetic energy of heat.. . Stars continue to collapse under gravity and get hotter until something stops them. What stops them is that they become so hot that nuclear fusion starts to happen in their core. This keeps the core so hot that it produces so many photons that photon pressure stops the star collapsing any further.. . When nuclear reactions stop in the centre of a star, it starts to collapse again under gravity. But our sun is a long way off that happening.

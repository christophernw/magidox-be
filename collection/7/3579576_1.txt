Mobil one was one of the first synthetic oils and has been around since the 1960s. I trust what they recommend in general when using their synthetic oils, and they say that they provide extended drain intervals. However, your car warranty may require a 5,000 mile maximum drain interval to maintain your warranty whether you use conventional or synthetic oil. I have used Mobil one since 1970 and change my oil and filter every 9,000 miles and have never had any major engine work of any kind on 8 different cars I've owned. But, on my newer car that's still under warranty, I change the oil according to the manufacturer's requirement. I also always use the manufacturer's OEM oil filter. Many new cars come with synthetic oil installed, and you can mix conventional and synthetic according to the information I've read. If your going to change your oil every 3,000 miles, then I would suggest sticking with conventional oil because of the extra cost of synthetics. One final proviso is that the engine is operating normally, and that there's no excessive contaminants due to improper engine operation. Highway driving is easiest on any oil whether conventional or synthetic.

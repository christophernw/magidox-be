If you know the water pump is bad,then that means no coolant is being recirculating thru the engine. Therefore your engine temp. is hot,and when it is hot it needs to blow some steam since your coolant is not being circulating into the radiator. So your head gasket is blown. If you would've fix the waterpump,you wouldn't had a blown head gasket.

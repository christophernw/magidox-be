i was smoking at age of 12 quit few months ago it made me feel better im still out of shape and breath most of time but doing better than i was while smoking. believe me its worth quitting its hard as hell and its good if u have sumone there to be proud of u. without my now ex friend at one point who i really cared about it felt good to see her smile when i told her i went another day without smoking. but u gotta do it for urself most of all or ull just end up starting again

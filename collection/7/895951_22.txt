In simple terms. 666 represents the number of the beast. It probably wont be the actual numbers 666 but will probably have its basis from 666. Maybe a chip inserted to ones body with the serial number 060606 or made on the 6 day 6 month of the 06 year. One will not be able to do anything in society unless he has this "mark". No shopping or traveling. Anyone not accepting the mark will be persecuted.. The beast is the anti-Christ and that's basically going to be a powerful leader both in religion and politics. He or She is not going to have an sweater embrodered with an anti-christ slogan. He or she will be nothing close to an anti-christ to those who are deceived by it. It will be a hero to many and saviour to others. I could say a lot more but I'm trying to keep in simple here but it is a complex discussion.

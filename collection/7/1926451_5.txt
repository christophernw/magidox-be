I don't think bush attacked Iraq. He did it for our country. Just think about 9 11. What happened because of stupid people attacking our country. It is not a pay- back it is just helping. Bush is helping that country with like women. They can do so much more then what they use to do. Schools are better, children and acting like children. Yes, there are boms and suicide but those people are use to change and they can't take it. People are becoming more independant. I like what Bush did and I think he is doing awesome! . . I SUPPORT BUSH!

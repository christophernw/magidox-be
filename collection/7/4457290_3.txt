because um...i dont know....but i'm sure the whole jesus thing is also a myth but people wanted to believe and now almost everybody in the world acts like a slave to god. and i think it's pretty selfish to have to do everything "he" says and stop living your life and everythings a sin and you have to praise him every day or youre not a believer and such. stupid people. i dont know how people can say god or jesus saved them from depression or whatnot. it wasnt god or jesus, is was the idea of them. ok yea i'm probably not making sense but yes. and i hate when people think think youre the devil when you dont believe in god. there's no law that you have to believe in him ok? so bug off

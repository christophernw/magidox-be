Nuns do...Many christains don't follow the bible literally these days ,,but nevertheless I've seen many Arab christians cover their heads. Thanks for bringing this up as a Muslim women I get a lot of flak from some Christans for covering when the bible tells them to do it as well. I think Christians should support respect Nuns and Muslimas, and anyone who covers for God not call them backward or oppressed.

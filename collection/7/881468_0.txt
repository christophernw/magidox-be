The US set up the Electoral College because most Americans in that day and time couldn't read and write; so, it was believed that they needed someone who could to make decisions (laws) for them.  Since those days are passed, and the EC can elect someone who didin't win the popular vote, I believe it should be abolished and just go with the popular vote.. . Come to think of it, that would work in any country.

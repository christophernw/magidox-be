It could be something like a tragedy that happened to them where they almost lost their life or a loss of a loved on can sometimes make people realize we are in fact mortal, and in times of pain and anguish they turn to religion it helps them through there problem so now it has become a way of life. No harm in it, what ever works you know. Hopefully they don't push their beliefs onto other people.

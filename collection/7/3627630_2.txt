Early Christian Iconic art. It's crazy. You look at the Spanish wood paintings and there are like demons and dead babies, the saints are really mean looking (Crusades-- fear based) and then you look at the Italian and the Saints are so stoic and peaceful. I particularly like 12th century Franciscan crosses. As far as modern Art, I like Shep Fairey (OBEY)-- he's a printmaker; outsider art which lacks the pretention of art school and is usually accompanied by really good stories and my absolute favorite modern art peice is a Dee Dee Ramone painting that hangs in my living room called Morning Poop.

I am like this when . a) Im not doing much. b) I dont like what Im doing or its too hard (so I eat as a method of procrastinating). . Maybe its the same with you. If so, do things that you enjoy as much as possible, and find ways to get more enjoyment out of things that you have to do but don't enjoy. And keep busy and active!

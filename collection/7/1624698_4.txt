I have no idea! I love to read it's better than anything. THat's a good question though. Reading is like watching a great movie in your head. Its even better than that. I don't know why people don't like to read. I mean some say it makes them think and they don't like to think. Well, so what! Thinking is great! I love books and i'm so glad to see someone else who loves books too.

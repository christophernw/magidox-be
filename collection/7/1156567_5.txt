I am a sunday school teacher. I teach the kids how to be saved. I teach them all about God, and the 10 commandments. They learn how much God loves them. We talk about the creation. They learned that God created everything, not man. The list could go on forever. Every sunday God gives me a different lesson. They learn that Jesus loved them so much, that He died on the cross, and was burried, and Rose again on the third day. Every Sunday is a Blessing from God.

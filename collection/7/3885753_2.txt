I suppose since there body's contain mostly fluids while alive, that during the dehydration phase after death, the moisture evaporating happens from the easiest point of departure, their undercarriage, their body's flip.  I know the upper outer part of their body is usually heavily armored, so fluids would evaporate down, not up.  I am not sure, but that is my guess.  You do the research and let me know.

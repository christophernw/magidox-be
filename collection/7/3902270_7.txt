Is our existence, our life, nothing but a random event, the leaf blowing in the wind, the ripple in the stream? If we suggest that there is a meaning or purpose superimposed on human life, what is the mysterious power that imbues our life with such a purpose or meaning? If this obscure power does exist, how does it manifest itself? If this obscure power does not manifest itself to humans in any objective form, it does not exist as far as humans are concerned. Therefore, it cannot convey a preordained or predestined meaning to our life. . . Biology defines human beings as animals. Do other animals have a meaning or significance attached to their life? If only human life has meaning, what is it that sets humans apart from other animals? The great apes are the first cousins of humans. Is there a meaning attached to their life? Does a cow, a pig or a monkey have a meaning or purpose ascribed to its life, except to serve as food for humans? Dolphins are said to have large brains and can commmuncate with each other from great distances do they have meaning?. . The search for a meaning in life is analogous to medical quackery because we are allowing superstition and inefficacious conduct to usurp our rational means of dealing with our environment. A search for a meaning or a purpose in our life will impair our opportunity to lead rational, effective lives in a manner consistent with the innate nature of man. . . A futile search for an elusive meaning prevents us from correctly aligning ourselves with Objective Reality. It will frustrate our ability to achieve the only real success in life: Optimal, lasting happiness.

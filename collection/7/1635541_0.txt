Leukocytes (white cells) play a major role in the immune system. They fight infection by destroying and/or consuming bacteria, viruses and anything else the body regards as "foreign". If you have an elevated white count this indicates  infection or a condition such as leukemia.  You lower the white count through the use of antibiotic therapy.  If you know for a fact that you are without infection, you don't want to decrease the number of these vital blood cells.  What is your situation?  You don't say why you wish to do this.

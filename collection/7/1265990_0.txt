Many genes that cause problems are recessive meaning it takes the same gene fron each parent to produce the problem.  If 1 parent provides a dominant gene and the other has a recessive,  then the problem won't manifest itself. With inbreeding, you have the gene present in a greater percentage of potential parents   so the likelihood is greater that both parents will have a recessive gene than in a "normal" population pool.Thus the likelihood of producing offspring with the problem

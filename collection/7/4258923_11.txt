" The road to hell is often paved with good intentions ", I've heard that so many times that it's stuck in my head, is it true, well in my belief system yes, hel does exist and there is no burning but eternal torment and suffering is the menu of the day, so to speak. we are born live life and die, how we live our lives refects the hel we will endure in the next life, if your evil you go to hel and if you are good and brave you go to valhalla/heaven whatever, the point is that there are so many different versions of hel, that they all can't be wrong.

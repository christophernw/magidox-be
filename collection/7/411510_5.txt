Two of the biggest problems not mentioned so far are these... Gnostics preached a different Gospel, and Gnostics were very exclusive in that they did not share their beliefs unless they felt you were worthy. In Revelation 2 Jesus says this  "But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate." From writings we have found outside of the bible, the Nicolaitans seem to have been a forefather to gnostic teachings. So, to simplify, the felt truth should only be given to people who diserved it, and they did not preach the same message that Jesus did.

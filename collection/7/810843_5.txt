could be several things. a tire out of balance, a broke belt in a tire, you  may need a brake job and have the rotors turned. my pontiac firebird was doing the same thing. i got new brakes all the way around and had them to turn the rotors and it fixed mine. my mechanic told me that any these things  could be causing it. since i had just recently bought a new set of tires i tried the brake job first. apparently he was right.

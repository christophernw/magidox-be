Could be several causes but here are some suggestions/questions.. . Do you have a good filter on the acquarium?  The ones that work off and air "bubbler" don't really provide the needed circulation and filtration.  So if that is what you have, I'd recommend you get a filter that circulates the water efficiently, and uses granular carbon.  Depending on the size of your acquarium the filtration needs will change.  Read the packages and select a filter that will filter your entire tank capacity a few times an hour. . . You may be over feeding your fish.  Believe me, we all tend to give them way more than they need.  So watch the amount you give them.  It's best to give them a little and see if they eat it all.  If they do give them a little more.... repeat until you know how much they will consume.. . Another thing that helps with the overall health of the acquarium is to get some Corydora's, small catfish.  They help immensely to keep the bottom of the tank clean of excess food, etc.. . Usually a smelly tank is caused by decaying matter.  So watch your tank carefully for any material that may be lying on the bottom.  If you see it, take it out with a small net.  Sometimes ammonia can build up, but this is usually from fish urine and improper filtration.. . ALSO:  Make sure you tank is within the recommended temperature range for the fish you have.  Higher temps promote decay and bacterial and algae growth.  All of these can contribute also.. . Good luck.  Take care of them they are living beings and are depending on you.

I am an English teacher, and in my opinion, my students don't listen to English nearly enough.  Even when students come to the United States to learn English, after they leave the English class they don't hear any more English because they don't spend any time with English speakers or listen to English media!  It's silly, wouldn't you agree?  So my advice is: listen to English a lot.  It takes energy to listen to a new language, but over time it will get easier.  When you listen, more information about English will go into your brain, and it will help you to speak better.  A good place to listen to English is in a class, of course, or you can use TV, movies, or music, or find a conversation partner.  If you decide to listen to TV or movies, don't use captions or subtitles.  If you read, your brain won't need to listen for the information; that will build your reading skills, but not your listening skills.

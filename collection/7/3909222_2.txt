Migraine is a neurologic disease, of which the most common symptom is an intense and disabling headache. Migraine is the most common type of vascular headache. Migraine headaches are usually characterized by severe pain on one or both sides of the head, an upset stomach, hypersensitivity to light (photophobia) and hypersensitivity to sound (phonophobia). The word "migraine" comes from the Greek construction "hemikranion" (ημικρανίον, pain affecting one side of the head).

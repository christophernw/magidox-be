Ignoring the 600-lb. gorilla in the corner is not a good way to deal with it. I believe it far better to meet and discuss differences and similarities than to snub him because he doesn't agree with our cultural differences (and abortion is not universally agreed upon in the US). Know you enemies - don't ignore them and you don't have to kiss their derriere in doing it. China is a major emerging power and to chose to isolate ourselves from them is not at all in the long-term interests (economic and from a safety standpoint) for the United States. Don't sweat the small stuff when the future of your country may be at stake.

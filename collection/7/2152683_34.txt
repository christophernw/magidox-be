That sounds familiar!  I used to get colds every month, was the weakest person anyone has ever known.... . . Then I discovered a solution - exercise.  I started running to keep fit, but it built up my immune system and general fitness level, and i've not had even a sniff of a cold for ages!!  . . I'm not a fan of taking supplements/tablets, and don't really watch my diet, although i think eating well and resting of course helps too.. . What i'm suggesting is a lifestyle change, give it a try for a month, and you'll definately see the difference!!

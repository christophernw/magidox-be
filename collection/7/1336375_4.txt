Don't resort to spying on your employees, at least not if you want to be on their good side. I suppose it really depends on your management style. If you're more about winning hearts and minds and "leading" rather than "managing" then that isn't the route you want to take. If you're more strict and authoritarian, then that might work to keep tabs on whats going on but you'll be micro-managing and mostly end up alienating people and reducing morale. But you'll be in charge, right?. . The better path to take would be to use the open door policy to your advantage. Let your workers know that you're available for them 24/7 and willing to hear their concerns. If they're in the wrong, let them know. If they're right, tell them so and take steps to fix the problem. You'll build credibility and trust and ultimately help things run more smoothly.. . Finally, with a staff that large you won't be able to keep tabs on everything - use delegation buddy. Rely on your department leads and assistant managers. If you feel that you can't trust them with those kinds of tasks, then build the trust or find another lead.. . Good luck!

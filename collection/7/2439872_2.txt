The simplest way is to buy a paper which has a trashy story about him on the front page, the media will see what is selling their paper and do the dirt digging for you and expose the full extent of this mans, and i use the term loosely, 'government'. His own party will soon rebel against him in gargantuan fashion and oust him as leader of their party!!! Of course then we have to deal with his successor the irrepressible Mr G. Brown M.P.

hmm... 1 min doesn't sound like long.. i keep mine in the teapot for 1/2 day and the tea tastes alright... . maybe it's the brand you're using.. i am used to  Lipton's Yellow Label Tea.. the black tea tastes different... dilma's teas are also really good.... maybe you'll have to put the tea bag in, and leave it in the water.. don't jiggle it around too much..

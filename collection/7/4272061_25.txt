all you can do is your best hun.  Know your limits and dont push past them. if u know that you already have hard time with school work then try not to take on too many extra activities.  And trust me in highschool they are great usually for helping students. Try to make it fun though. Through all my school years i honestly remember highschool the most. i wish i would have made more out of it. good luck and take care i am sure you will do great.

I think it's because Saddam's trial would have looked better if he was tried by Iraqis (poetic justice, if you will).  The whole trial was basically a PR spin job (why do you think it was the Sunday before elections?)  Plus, they knew they'd get a straight conviction in an democratic Iraqi court (Read: Iraqis hand-picked by the US government with an already pre-disposed hatred of Saddam), while there could have been complications (hung juries, mistrials) in say, a UN court or whatever.

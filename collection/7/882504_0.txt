History is history.  It's the study of recorded events.  Whether those events surround people and events of religious significance doesn't affect whether it's history or not.. . If you're studying things like whether or not Christ was the Son of God, well, that's no longer history.  That's theology, which is also a valid area of study, but it's not history.

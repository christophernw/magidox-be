Well, most places where polygamy is allowed - it's because of the role of the man and woman in that society.. . Men are usually considered the guardians and protectors over women - they should help feed, clothe, and nurture them. In this case, if there were ever a lack of men, they would be allowed to practice polygamy (MARRYING and taking responsibility for more than one wife) in order to make sure that ladies are not left without guardians. . . And Allah knows best.

good question...it's very good to question.. . my answer- God didn't tell ONLY the europeans...MAN wrote all of the different scriptures around the world, and each of them believe themselves to be right, so it's man's ego and the desire to control or govern the people that has inspired and perpetuated the belief that there is only ONE way to God. i believe there are many paths, and of coarse they would be all different, because although we are all human, we all have cultural differences based on where we are from, so God speaks to us ALL in the way that is most clear to us all individually. that is my simple answer.

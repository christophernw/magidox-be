I had 3 ovarian cysts and i got them removed when i was 12. You would have felt it if your cysts ruptured. You might want to call an advice nurse. A cyst can be huge and weigh around 2-3 time your body weight. If you look in the Guinness Book of World Records, The Largest Mass Ever Removed Intact and the Heaviest Tumor or Mass, i forget, were all ovarian cysts. i would get thhem removed.

WELL when you have an abortion, you want the baby to go away soo much that u feel like you NEED to abort your baby. When really everything will be alright you will get through it. When you abort a baby you're killing you're own baby, from the moment it's concieved to its death it is a human and to me abortion is murder. 98% of the time women have abortions they feel very guilty,and depressed most of their live . The moral of the story is, yes the baby will go away, but the guilt won't. . . P.s. If someone decides to have an abortion and then changes their mind, once the child gets older, it's hard to imagine what their life would be like without their child. . . ** If anyone reading this is considering abortion, please reconsider, for you're killing your own child, you can live through it!...It might be a little "rocky" on the way but you can live through it..... . All of you considering abortions are in my prayers!!!. . God Bless

In India family relations are quite important.Parents do not send there children out as soon as they turn 18. Instead they support them to college and get on their feet. . . Marriage is a union of two families here, not just between two individuals.Elderly people live with family and not in oldage homes.. . Arranged marriage does not mean that bride and groom do not participate in the proess. But elders are often able to consider other facters necessary to be considered for a stronger bonds . . . There is much less pressure on unmarried girls to get out and seek a husband. Many of the boys and girls feel comfortable that parents are asking the hard question.. . When so many people are involved in the process, if some troubles come up , they are there to get through this too.They also feel responsible to seek solutions.Divorce rate is low in India.. . There are also love marriages. But many of them too seek out parents for final decesion. Couples do marry on their own too, without seeking parental approval. Alaways had. Just that it is not that much popular.. . The concept of love marriage is more popular because of romantic films and novels, western ideas.In love marriages in India, I have seen people are often more in love with the idea of love marriage than the marriage itself.. . In this context they are more failures here in love marriage here.

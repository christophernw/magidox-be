The foundation of all forms of capitalism is the culture of towns and cities. Abolish the culture of the towns and cities and replace them with the collective farming culture with fields of plants and farm animals and you get rid of all chances of capitalism returning. Capitalism is based on the belief that towns and cities are productive rather than parasitic, once the masses realize this and act upon it by replacing the towns and cities with fields of agriculture, than the masses will not only get rid of poverty, over-population centers, and pollution but also crime, war, and hunger.

they do have a nucleus when they are still being formed in the red bone marrow, but once they are mature enough the nucleus is excluded so that there is maximum room to store-hole hemoglobin in the rbc.  less than 1% of rbcs are found in the cirulation-blood.  If more than that,it is indicative of disease and needs to be treated since rbcs with nucleii can't carry oxygen, are too big,and get squished-damaged in the capillaries.  Without a nucleus they can fit single file and go thru without getting too beat up-bruised and live their usual life of 120 days.

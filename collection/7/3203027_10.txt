just shave regularly for a while shaving does not make more hair grow either it just lets the coarser darker hair grow out eventually it will work and you'll have facial hair unless its just not in your genes I could grow a full beard when I was like 17-18( 21 now)so It really runs in my genes just keep at it maybe you can talk to a doctor and they can give you more hormones or something

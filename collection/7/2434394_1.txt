Action replay is a disc that contains a list of cheats for games on a particular console. way to use it (i'm talking about the one I had for ps2 so it might be different for the Cube). First place the cheat disc into your console as you would a normal game, then choose the game you want to cheat on, choose the cheats you want to activate and then exit the menu when you get out completly, eject the cheat disc (don't turn it off just eject it) and then insert your game, a few seconds later it should begin with the cheats activated...

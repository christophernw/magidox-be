When it's nasty, the victim can end up being denied opportunities which may have given them a better life.  A rumor that someone is a drug addict could keep them from getting a certain job.  If you lie and say someone is abusive they may have trouble getting a date or even lose their children.  They can unfairly destroy someones life.

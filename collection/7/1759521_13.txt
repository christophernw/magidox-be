For the response above: who says that we have to choose between drugs and alcohol? I do neither. No one is forcing you to choose a vice instead of having none. I agree that it is somewhat hypocritical to say one is bad and the other is not, however I still would not want pot legalized. I took a very interesting class about criminology (which I understand does not make me an expert on crime but has helped me to form more educated opinions) which indicated that drugs are very closely correlated with many types of crime. In my mind, even a correlation is enough to outlaw it. Furthermore, I do not feel that drugs are a good way to broaden your horizons. What about traveling the world, or even reading about other cultures, philosophies, and religions? There is so much to learn in the world and I don't think you can learn any of it from smoking pot. I think that drugs are about enjoyment and recreation, not about politics and philosophies.. . Sorry, got a little off track from your question. I think a large part of why alcohol is still legal is because of corporate money. Companies that make alcohol are (for better or worse) significant contributers to the economy. Our government is heavily influenced by companies that can provide money for various funds, especially campaign funds.. . Also, although you may not see it in everyday life, America is a very conservative country. Alcohol may be a financial boon to our economy, but drugs are seen in a different light by most Americans. When conservative America thinks "drugs," they relate the term to crime and poverty. It may not be true, but that's life. It doesn't have to be true, but if enough people believe drugs are worse than alcohol then drugs stay illegal and alcohol legal.

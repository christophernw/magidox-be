The one idea you need to consider is the enormous time frame. How can life not change? Beings with a shorter life span are evolving before our eyes, like viruses just to name one. And why do people live longer now? Women are giving birth later in life and as far as evolution goes that is our sole purpose so our women and men are evolving to accommodate. So if we wanted our kids and their kids to live longer lives then all we have to do is have children later and later in life. In the future people may be able to live for 150 to 200 years, that is unless they smoke.

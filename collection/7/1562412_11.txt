Good idea, but only for low velocities.  At higher velocities (10mph or greater) the rubber would turn a fender bender into a neck wrenching accident.  The cars might not sustain much damage, but the energy from the wreck would go somewhere, and a lot of it would end up hurting the people inside.  As they are right now bumper are designed to crumble under impact to absorb as much energy as possible.  This keeps injuries to a minimum.

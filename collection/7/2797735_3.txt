Call your phone company to see if they have a booklet or some sort of instructions for this phone. If not go to any cell phone store and ask them. If they don't have any instructions for you, ask them what store may carry that type of phone.. The best way to put things on it is to do it your way, not someone else's way. You may end up with things you don't want or don't want to pay for.

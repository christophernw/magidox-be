First of all, I like the two previous answers, and would like to just add something:. . There is one thing (at least) that you need to be very aware of when dealing with rational exponents in the real numbers.  All rational numbers n/m can be written in a reduced form p/q where n/m=p/q and p and q are "relatively prime" (that means no prime can divide both p and q, thus no number not equal to 1 can divide both p and q).  Insbesodere p and q are not both even (because if they were both even, then 2 would divide both).. . If you have a^(n/m)=a^(p/q) for some a<0 you can have problems.  If q is odd than you won't have a problem at all, but if q is even, you won't get a real answer.. . This is why (assume q is even and a<0):. . q is even, so q=2s for some s.  Thus a^(p/q)=a^(1/2)(1/s), but since a<0, a^(1/2) (which equals sqrt of a, of course) is complex and not real, so a^(p/q) is complex and not real.

Depends on where you are going to put it. I like the nice, clean, bold lines with acrylic paint. Nothing tacky but really simple shapes or noone will get it when they look at it. Corals, umber & turquoise if you are going Native American. Aqua and peach or pink or something bright if you are going Hispanic. I've seen a nice one w/ the American Flag painted on it. I liked it. Don't forget the sealer if it is going outside.

First of all, when I came here, I was 8.  Back in my country of Laos, it made sense as to everyone to speak our native language of Laotian, just as much as it made sense to you guys to speak your native language of English.  When we come over here, we don't have years to prepare to come over here.  We only have a few days.  Give us time to learn the language.  And with English being your native language, even if you knew Laotian, and you had moved over to my country, odds are, if you see someone that is available that speaks English as well, you will probably end up conversing in English.. . Put yourselves in our shoes, instead of being the selfish, ignorant, racist pigs you are, and grow up.

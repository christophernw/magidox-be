Fish tanks need to have regular maintenance performed. Fish excrete ammonia which is toxic in a closed environment. A cloudy aquarium comes from the high concentration of ammonia and the resulting bacteria bloom in the tank. This also causes an odor which smells fishy. I am guessing trhe plastic odor is the tank itself and it has a slight smell as well.. . You need to add a chemical for neutralizing chlorine and ammonia. I like AmQuel. Do a partial water change weekly. You did nt mention how mnay gallons this tank is. But I suggest 5% weekly, or 25% monthly.

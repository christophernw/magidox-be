The principle is that all knowledge is good as long as it has life enhancing influence. If you study logic with some wider purpose attached, as a part of a profession perhaps, than a study into logic is perfectly safe thing to indulge into. It can be a gorgeous way to think about things and events of life. You see all things are things in life, and they should be for life, productive useful and life enhancing. Obsession of anything is bad. If on the other hand an expertise in logic can make you a good lawyer or a scientist than that is perfectly right to study logic to your minds content.. . The flip side of the coin is that I personally would not like to have pointy ears like Mr. Spock, as the logic can be to do with considering logical consequences of all things, which is good. But this can be equally bad for a good person in this day and age where most things happen without a reason that a good man can understand. Our natural ability to reason our way through life and its dilemmas is sufficient enough to live a happy life. If we over sensitise ourselves about logical aspect of life too much then we will definitely be doing this at the cost of something else in our mind - our aesthetic or creative qualities perhaps.

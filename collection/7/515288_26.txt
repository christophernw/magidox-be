That is so funny,becouse alot of times it's true.  I have had those coversations too.  I think it would be becouse they don't really know the answer to your question,or at the risk of being to 'judgmental' maybe they are not as secure in thier faith as they think they need to be.  I wouldn't mind answering any questions though.  I am a christian.  I am not the brainiest or the biggest thealogian but I would try.  I love talking about Jesus!

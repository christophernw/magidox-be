Questions of self defense against the very dangerous answer to mysticism: violence. It's like asking a dishonest man, "How dare you sir!" If you aren't being reasonable, but yet not violent, being a rational civilized human being, my recourse will only be to attempt to reason with you. Failing that I will leave you to your insanity, but if you attempt to threaten me, a criminal act, then I will fight back, with well justified force.

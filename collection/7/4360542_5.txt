U r a Blockhead. U know nothing about Islam. u need to discover wat Islam actually is before judging it. Have u read the Qurran or just presuming it? If u look around the world hundreds of Muslims r being killed everyday in Palestine, Iraq, Kashmir, Afghanistan. Considering Bin ladins deeds as projection of true Islam is purely ridiculous. Do u know wat Americans r doing in Guantanamo bay, Afghanistan, Iraq. Have seen wat they did in Abu Ghuraib Jail in Iraq. Do u think we should also consider all of these cruel act as Christians acts . Ur Question is truely baseless.

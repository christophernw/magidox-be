What is a Gnostic? . . Gnosis "to KNOW" (interestingly enough the word Buddha can be seen as to "know"). . Thus a Gnostic is one who favours experiental 1st hand Knowledge of the Divine OVER anything else.  There were (and are) many schools of Gnosticism...depsite the previous poster's ideas..hellenism is not the only facet of Gnosticism..... . . *2 What is Gnosis? . . Now we are getting semantics. . DO you pray and pay adoration to yourself?. . DO you meditate upon yourself?. . Do you advocate rasing the self?. . OR God?. . . It is neither the intellectual engagement with God nor the knowledgeof the reason about God but it is the personal experience of God.The knowledge of God is closely connected with the theoria (vision)of the uncreated Light. This knowledge is beyond any other createdknowledge. It is achieved through man's theosis. Theosis is man'scommunion and union with God. And it is this union which engendersknowledge of God, which is of a higher order than and above anyother human knowledge. . . Heresy:. . "I summon ye thee foul goat demon...come hither before me..and grant me thine aid...and give me the bestest new goat udders". . Is this Gnosis? NO...this is feeding the self. Thius is elavatingthe self.. What is wrong with elavating the self? Do we serve the divine or dowe serve our selves? Do we love God? Or ourselves?. . . . . "To love means to commit oneself without guarantee, to give oneselfcompletely in the hope that our love will produce love in the lovedperson.". ---Eric Fromm. . . . . So we see truely love is to GIVE...as God GIVES....if we are to LOVEGod we must give of ourselves completly. Giving partially is likemaking love while wearing a condom. There is a barrier... When weseek to elevate the self as opposed to dissolve the self we cling tothe world. We are of the demi urge...we are stuck in life and deathand rebirth....we are not transcending.... . . . . "Light and Darkness, life and death, right and left, are brothers ofone another. They are inseparable. Because of this neither are thegood good, nor evil evil, nor is life life, nor death death. Forthis reason each one will dissolve into its earliest origin. Butthose who are exalted above the world are indissoluble, eternal."---the Gospel of Philip. . . . . Upon realising that he must give to the Christ in him self...andthus elavate God...not the self in himslef John the Baptist said. "He must increase and I must decrease". . . . . Here we see....John was saying.....God must increase..and the selfmust be lost in God.. . Thus we see we either embrace God and theChrist or we pretend we do.. An egg does not hatch and become a chicken no matter how much itscreams and says "I am a chicken". . . . . "I do not pray because it changes God or God's mind, I pray becauseit changes me" --CS Lewis. . . . . Here again we see the change in me...CHANGE not elevation.Awakening the God within..not empowering the self.. . . . . ..."come hither fowl demon and giveth me yourspecial nipple rings that are shiney and I will have greeat power". Which is not Gnosis....this is self serving. This is treating thedivine as some special place we can take from and get what we want.. This is not love.. . . . . "All life is the progression towards, and the recession from, onephrase- I Love You.". --F Scot Fitzgerald. . . . . Over emphasis on one thing is also a hinderance. We can become likereductionist scientists. I like to think of it like this:. I take an apple...I smash it with a sledge hammer. I study andlearn about the apple pulp. Afterwards I claim I know everythingabout apple trees.. Clearly this is absurd.. Yours in Christ and Sophia . . --He who knows both knowledge and ignorance together, crosses deaththrough ignorance and attains immortality through knowledge.. . . . . The idea that Gnostics thought of the manifest as evil is incorrect and not the whole story

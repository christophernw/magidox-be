I concur with the previous answer.. . Gwen, Gwenan, Gwennan and others are all essentially the same, but i prefer your spelling (no need for double n).. . Gwen is the the feminine form of Gwyn (itself a popular name) meaning white in Welsh.  In the welsh language, white is associated with holiness or a blessed state or purity.  Therefore, it crops up all the time in names and hymns!

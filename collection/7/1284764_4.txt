If we're referring mainly to the American young people who contribute to this site, it really isn't their fault.  It's the fault of the government-run schools in the United States, which have reduced my nation to near-illiteracy.  These schools no longer teach spelling, writing, geography, mathematics, etc.  They only pretend to do this, while mainly engaging in displays of political correctness and other useless endeavors.  Parents, who can afford to do so, should abandon the useless public schools in America and find some alternative means of educating their children.

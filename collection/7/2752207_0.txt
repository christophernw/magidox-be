If you dont live in the Americas, which I guess you dont, watch american news channels like CNBC and pay careful attention to the accent they use, try to repeat sentences, helps better if you tape one episode and watch it over and over, trying to repeat. News are good if you are learning the accent for employment as they use a neutral accent.. . However if you are keen on learning specific accents, like the southern accent or the texan drawl, watch hollywood movies and copy them.. . Hope this helps

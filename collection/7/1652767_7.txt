Judging by how you wrote that sentence, I'm not so sure you want to find out.  Jokes aside, each drink remains in your system for approximately 1 hour depending on ones own ability to metabolize alcohol.  One may make some very poor decisions while drunk especially with what you say (and what you do if you have access to a vehicle) and these decisions will last the rest of one's life.  Obviously the higher the rate at which one consumes alcohol, the quicker and more intense the poor decision making will be.  One can even die from drinking too much too quickly but usually  a person's subconscious mind is still smart enough to shut the body down (make you throw up or pass out) before this happens.

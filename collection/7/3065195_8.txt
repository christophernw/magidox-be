that is irrelevant isnt it,imagine if you were all alone in the woods and you were asking yourself that like dude why i am here what is this place what do i do know,its all bullsh*t,this is all we know,people act sometimes like this isnt good enough or that we came from somewhere else and this is not our home,well get over it your here and you better start figuring out what your here for real fast,so are you here to be as bad as you can be and do whatever you want or are you here to follow the law of the land and go with the flow.its easy to be bad but its hard too be and stay good.anyone can just free for all it and do whatever,but living this way is pointless and has no real purpose.

I'd like to know myself. You have some good answers here. Have you noticed that a simple question like this can get you labeled a racist? I think now if you're white you are supposed to shut up and take it--it's the only polite and politically correct response. And please don't claim to have been on the receiving end of racism--that will only make you appear rediculous to those who know what true oppression is. Only minorities have feelings and rights.

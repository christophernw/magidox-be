Equity is equal to assests minus liabilities. The assest value of the home (Market value) minus the liability (mortgage) is the equity you have in your home.. . Example if your home is worth $314,950 and you pay a down payment of $1,000 your equity is $1,000. Asset value 314,950 - liability value 313,950 = 1,000.. . If one year from now your home goes up in value to 320,000 and you have paid the principal off by another $6,000 the equity would be;  Asset value 320,000 - liability 307,950 your equity is $12,050.

Depends on whether you believe them or not. Personally, every chain letter I get I delete immediately. I will only forward it if it is absolutely awesome and cool.. . For instance, this email had a link to this. http://www.stacken.kth.se/lists/best-forestry/2001-05/jpg00000.jpg. which is hillarious to me, so I forward it to all my friends. . . If you do for some unfound reason believe in it, I guess just forward it, but I personally hate getting those things.

I do not fully support ether side in this conflict.  There is plenty of blood on everyones hands.  . . I personally find the 1947 UN Partition Plan to be the best plan to deal with the problems they face.. . Today this plan is very unrealistic, but a two-state solution with a shared capital sounds like the best plan I know of.. . The economist had a good editorial about what a true plan for peace would look like.

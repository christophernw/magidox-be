Where is it listed? As far as I know, you can't get it not listed because it's most likely not listed anywhere. I agree with the other person in that you should not give it out unless it is absolutely required. When opening a bank account, applying for a loan, or anything similar. I usually tell businesses I don't want to give it out and I'll give my drivers license number instead.

I have come to realize that there are no ghosts, only demons.   This is no joke my family and I have encountered demons before, and the only thing that seems to work against them is prayer and reading the bible.   Whenever you see or here her call on the name of Jesus out Loud, pray  out loud ask the Lord for strength.  In the bible it says whatever you bind on earth is bound in heaven, so in the name of Jesus you bind this thing and command it in the name of Jesus to leave you and never return.  It may continue to become stronger with it's tactics, however it only get it's strength from your fears.  . . Please disregard the others who are telling you to communicate with this thing, it will only encourage other demons to come around you.  . . Please read Psalm 91, Psalm 27 and especially Isaiah 14:12-19.  Be encouraged it cannot hurt you, just believe in the Lord and he will see you through.

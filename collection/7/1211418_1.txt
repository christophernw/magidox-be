Basically men never ever understand women. Oh, some of us get lucky once in a while and find someone that we think we understand, but basically you are all too "complex", and we are all too simple to have any clue of what you are about.. . As a Electical Engineer myself, I do have to say that I have never heard the assumption that Chemical Engineers are all supposed to be "tatooed jarhead ", usually engineers are thought of a being star trek loving computer geek nerds (at least until we graduate and start making some big bucks)...Not true of course but a common misconception I can assure you.

Very simply, extrapolation means going outside the range of measured data to make predictions, either past or future.  For example, if a set of data produces some sort of pattern, extrapolation involves making assumptions beyond the original data, either above or below, based on the observed pattern.. . Related to extrapolation is interpolation, which refers to making inferences about data points which lie between measured ones.  This is usually more reliable than extrapolation, since we have observed data points on both sides of the point for which we are interpolating.

Actually...this summer I was playing with the ants at the farm, feeding them stuff and watch it get taken, and there were these big black ants that were really not interested in sugar. They never found the pile of sugar I made near the anthill and even passed over sugar I dropped in their trail.. They eagerly attacked insects, but did not seem to notice insects that hd been immersed in pool water (with chlorine).. . Other than these particular fellas (...girls, sorry), ants do get in the bags of sugar.

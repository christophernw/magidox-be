That is such a general statement. Or, question rather. Blacks are not the only hated group. Every race is hated by someone somewhere. It is called racism, and unfortunately we will never be able to do away with it. Hate for any race usually spurs from a superior race type of belief where one race believes they are better than the other. Anywhere cultures clash, there will be hostility.

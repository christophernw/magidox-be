Well I don't know if you can say it is getting hotter and hotter every year, but the trend is towards a hotter average climate. This is coined global warming, and virtually all of the climatologist attribute it to the increase of Greenhouse Gases. The way Greenhouse Gases work is that they are transparent to light in the visible spectrum yet absorb IR light. So light comes in from the Sun and heats the ground and oceans, but when that heat is radiated back out in the form of IR light it is reabsorbed by greenhouse gases and not allowed to escape into space as easily. This causes a net increase in the heat energy balance at the surface of the Earth.

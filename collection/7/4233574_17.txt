Dinosaurs are not pertinent enough to have anything to do with what the bible is for or represents.. That is like asking why dont guns and ammo have anything to with kitty cats and puppy dogs... One has nothing to do with the other.. I would have to say that Dinosaures were not in living exsistance during biblical times .... Like cars and trucks werent around then, they arent mentioned in the bible either.. Ya get what I mean? they werent in daily exsistance in that time period to even be a subject for the bible to have em in it... Good luck with getting your answers and God Bless.........

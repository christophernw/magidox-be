You make the point that all British people are nosey, rude and racist, but branding us all the same makes YOU racist. You know how hurtful it is to be judged on your culture, so why are you doing it to other people? . . A lot of younger British people just want everyone to get on, but people like you who keep branding us with the same mark as older people who sometimes are rude just make this harder for us... We dont care what race or culture you come from, we see you for the person you are, and we'd appreciate you to do the same instead of dismissing us because of the actions of others.

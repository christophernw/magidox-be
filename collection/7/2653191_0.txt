I believe what you are referring to is water.  And it is not flies, it is only one fly.  I do not know of the authenticity of this but I have heard it before.  Although it may sound disgusting, there were people living in the middle of the desert with rarely any water around trying to survive.  Many of us would probably eat the fly too.  Must be careful of what you read, as you are well aware, Prophet Muhammad (SAW) has a lot of enemies, even more so than prophet Moses or Jesus, but that is how it always is.  And I would say if it against science, then it is not authentic since the Qur'an is full of scientific facts.

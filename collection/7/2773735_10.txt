Yeah, my dog does it too! . 99% of the time she is my absolute best mate, but when she's sleepy she gets all her teeth out and grumbles at me if I pat her, she'll also give me that look too - it's horrible!. It's down to it being a dog's job to be alert all the time, if pooch is dozing - even if they are looking right at you - and they are touched, their instinct is to protect themselves so they 'attack' first. . Have you ever heard of the expression "Let sleeping dogs lie"? It's because of that reason!! The way to get round it is - when pooch starts to growl, mention their favourite word to snap them out of it. As soon as I say 'biscuit' to my dog, she's normal again..... and looking for a biscuit!!

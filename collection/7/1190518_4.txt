The problem is the simple one. Remeber BIble became bible only at 379 AC. NAd it were humans Bishops who picked which books go into the bible. Cristians even today think its only 1 men wrote the bible. They can't handle that it was assembled.. They are scriptures that mentioning  Lollith but Church decide not to include it. As for geneses alone not everything from Geneses went into the bible. THere is more in that scripture. But hey church needs power. Bringing concept of first female who disobey the god and then make another female who did exactly the same was too much for Church to handle.

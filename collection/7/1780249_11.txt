All preachers, priests and other charlatans have the same advice:. . 1. Give me money;. . 2. Praise Jesus;. . 3. Give me money;. . 4. Read the bible;. . 5. Give me money;. . 6. Pray.. . 7. Give me money.. . That is the pattern they all use although Catholics are never encouraged to actually read the bible, so I'm not sure what a priest charlatan would say, but he'd say something like that.

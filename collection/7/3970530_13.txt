when I wore contacts I had to use "tears" all day long to keep the eye moist.. it also helped with preserving the contacts. I had two different brands and both had the same effect on my eyes. I was lucky in a way, had cataract surgery which gave me 20/20 vision , a big surprise. Artificial "tears" were my only help before the surgery.

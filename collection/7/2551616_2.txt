You need to go to a Urologist and he/she can get you a ultrasound to look at them and see if this is the case in most men the bump there can be a from allot of other things and not just cancer so write down ALL questions and go in to the doctor with a bunch of information make sure you write down everything about any pain of funny feelings. Even the small things like when you pee does it burn or hurt in anyway. Maybe when you walk there is no feeling in that area. There is no stupid question at all to take to your doctor make it a learning experience that you will keep for life.

An agnostic is someone who believes there's a *possibility* that God exists, but they're not sure.. . An atheist, from my understanding, is someone who says that there is no God, and they believe it with all their heart. However, if you just do a little digging by asking some very specific questions, you'll see that an atheist is really just an agnostic. . . To be an atheist, one would have to know everything about everything and everything about *everyone*; every person on the face of the planet. And my goodness, no one's *that* smart!. . For example, let's say that 100% makes up all the knowledge in the world. And let's say an atheist knows an *amazing* one percent of all that knowledge. Isn't is possible that the other 99% of all the knowledge in the world is stuff that person hasn't discovered yet, either because they just didn't know, or didn't take the time to research it? These are rhetorical questions, of course. So isn't it possible that there are things about God (I say God with a capital "G" because I'm a Christian and believe there's only one) an atheist or an agnostic believes simply because they didn't take the time to research the facts concerning him? Again, this question is rhetorical.. . Anyway, I hope what I've said here helps in some way. Have a great week!

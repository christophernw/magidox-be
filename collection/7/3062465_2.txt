I donâ€™t believe that the intensity of a storm increases with rain. I have been though just about every type of imaginable storms and the only thing that they have in common is clouds even then sometimes you can have clear skies above you and a thunder storm in the distances, everything from thunderstorms with rain to thunderstorms without rain, or just rain, or hail and no thunderstorms

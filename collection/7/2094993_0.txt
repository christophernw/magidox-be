Human being's attitude is such that we tend to do those things which we ought not to do. For example, if u tell a child not to touch fire, they'll go and touch it to see what happens(if it is for the first time). The same is the case with these alcohol and cigarette. Some people just want to give a try, but, they get addicted to it.

For a paper you should ideally have a mixture of books, articles, reliable internet sources etc. The good point of books is that they're often more in-depth than an article, but sometimes they are not as current. However, my dissertation was almost entirely based upon books (it depends on the subject area studied as to whether many papers have been printed on it) and i did fine. so don't worry too much about finding articles to add to your reading list if they're irrelevant to your subject.

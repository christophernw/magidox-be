When people go to get into colleges and some races need higher scores and have better grades than others to be accepted.. . When people take public service exams and some races get promotions even with lower test scores than other races.. . When going for a job and some races and sexes get higher consideration than others.. . When the government makes domestic abuse policy and one sex is singled out as the abuser and has no recourse or resources if they are the abusee.. . When one sex has to register for the draft, and not the other.. . When politicians exempt themselves from the laws.. . But you know what? Life ain't fair. So no whining. Just work for equality before the law and fairness in opportunity. It's the best we can do.

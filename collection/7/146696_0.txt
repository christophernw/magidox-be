stand by the cage and begin to eat an apple or an orange if your pig makes noise he/she is fine.. mine is two and i had to get another one to keep him company because all he was doing was sleeping all day.. also a good way to see if your pig is scared is by picking him/her up hold him/her in your arms and if him/her tries to run into your armpit or under you jumper/jacket he/she is not used to being handled. . they do need loads of attention, but the fruit trick should work bite a bit of the fruit off and hold it in front of he/she and if he/she takes it he/she is not ill maybe just lonely

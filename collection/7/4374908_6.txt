One who saves. But that makes me a saviour because I occasionally play computer games, and I am a coward who saves alot.. . If Jesus (You seem to like to discuss this guy) was a saviour, who did he save, why and from what? Maybe you can say humankind and from evil. But evil is subjective, hmmm.. Why? It was his will. So one could call him an egoistic bastard. But that's unnecissary and I don't know why I'm typing any longer.

Inverter converts dc to ac. rectifier converts ac to dc. . ac- sinusoidal waveform. dc-direct (st. line). . . HVDC tranmission has both inverter station as well as rectifier station... . Power generation in the power plant is ac. . . For Hvdc transmission first it convert ac to dc at rectifier station and then tranmission line carries now dc. Before distribution it is inverted.Ie., inverter station convert dc to ac..

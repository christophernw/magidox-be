Stainless steel is produced by the addition of Chromium to produce the non-rusting properties and also results in the rearrangement of the molecular metal latice structure so that the magnetic domains are improperly aligned and will not alow or reduce the magnetic atraction. The amount of Chromium determines the degree of both the resistance to oxidation (rust) and the resistance to becomming magnetic. The typical anount of Chromium added is around 14%.

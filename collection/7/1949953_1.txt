Headaches are normally caused by changes in blood pressure. When you alter youâ€™re intake of carbs (carbs and sugars are almost the same) or salts, the result is a change in blood pressure.. . The mechanism is not easy to explain, but it has to do with partial osmotic pressures of glucose and electrolytes in blood and hormones regulating their concentration. It has to do with your kidneys and their ability to drive out or filter those excess solutes in your blood. It also depends on the ability of your tissues (mainly muscles and liver) to store glucose as glycogen.. . So a headache is a multivariable phenomenon, I recommend you should drink healthy amounts of water every day and fruits.

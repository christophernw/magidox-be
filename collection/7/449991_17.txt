Have you tried pinching your nose with your fingers and keeping your mouth closed and blowing out?  . . Also, try irigating your ear the next time you are in the shower by leaning your head to the side and letting the warm water flow into your ear for 10 or so seconds.  After you get out of the shower, massage your lymphs in the area of the blockage.  Throw in a salt water gargle too.

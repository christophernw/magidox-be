hi i think it is to do with a lack of iron and sugar.  ur best to regularly eat small snacks and drink plently of water or sweet water such as fruit juice etc..  ur doctor will probably tell u to eat more.  u probably ahve headaches alot to and dizziness, thats u needing water. also the iron u need lean meats/fish and green vegs.. . good luck, i dont think ur doc will give u medicine, or very little.!

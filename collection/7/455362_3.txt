This is a good question.. . First off, day dreaming is infact your mind wanting stimulation.  It desires stimulation.  If you want to do some deep thinking then try to do some other activity that will give your mind the stimulation that it desires.. . Activities to avoid would be watching a movie or t.v.  Try listening music, listening to a self help book on tape, walking either outside or on a treadmill.. . You can't stop day dreaming.  Infact a lot of the world's greatest thinkers got their ideas from day dreams.  Einstein and Edison to name two.

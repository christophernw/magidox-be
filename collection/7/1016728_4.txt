well, vegans like to have a plant diet because they dont want to have to put animals under any harm or stress just to get a full stomach, for instance vegans wont eat milk from cows because it is an unnatural process for the cow to keep making milk , the stress inflicted on the cow is like a human having to run six hours per day, also chickens have to put alot of energy to make eggs everyday , they have little energy left to move around even if they had the space, you could buy free range but animals would still be subject to unfair treatment  where after the cow cannot keep on going producing milk she is killed off immedietly , baby calves and lambs are taken away from their mothers in orderfor the milk to feul human consumption, chickens who cannot produce enough eggs each day (a completely unnatural thing for them to do ) are also immediately killed off, there are more reasons as to why people become vegans , it has a better impact on the environment (deforestation is widely due to meet land needs for cultivation and for cattle to graze).

Closing every other day would not have any significant effects on the market.. . Volatility in stock prices is not disruptive to the economy, by the way. It can make life hard for people who speculate in stocks, but price volatility simply means that the market hasn't yet made up its mind about the real valuation of a company.. . Best wishes, and God bless.

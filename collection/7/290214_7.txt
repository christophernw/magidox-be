If he is bleeding from the urinary tract it is because his digestive system cannot break down regular cat food & has built up "crystals" that are blocking him, he feels the need to pee but can't and strains so much so that he bleeds.  Get him to the vet pronto, they will give you some meds to break down the "crystals" it won't take long, then you will have to put him on a special food that will keep this from happening again anytime soon.  This is really very common in cats and dogs.

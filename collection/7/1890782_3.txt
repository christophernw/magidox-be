A 'religion' is not a sentient being with emotions.  If you say something about 'religion' it does not hurt.. it has no emotions.  It is a thing not a human being.  Human beings no matter their sexual preferences have emotions and the ability to be hurt by derogatory words and phrases.  People get up in arms because one is intentionally causing emotional distress to another member of the human race.

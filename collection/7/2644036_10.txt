when you catch them in the act roll up a magazine put thier nose in the mess ( or close enoough) and don't let them look waay from it. say no no each time and gently tap them on the rump.when they bark if you have them on a leash yank ( not too hard chihuahuas have sensitive necks ) it and yell BAAAAHHHHH!!!!!! another thing Chihuahuas aren't the challenge type ( if yours are don't do this) sit them down and put them in time out. don't let them move from that spt. If they do you hit thier rump softly. do theis for 2 minutes depending on how big the " NO NO" is. HOPE I HELPED

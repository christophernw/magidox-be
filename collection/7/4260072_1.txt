I much prefer REVOLUTION. It is a tube of liquid to apply to your dog's skin at the back of its neck. This protects from fleas, ticks, hearworm, mange mites, ear mites, and other parasites and diseases.. My hounds are super sensitive to most chemicals, but don't ever notice REVOLUTION. It is available at most vets.

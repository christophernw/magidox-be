The Dalai Lama once said, "The right religion is the one that cures the disease."  If your religion doesn't help you, how can it be right for you?  And if it does help you, what's the problem?. . You can argue Truth until you're blue in the face, but no human can completely understand the nature of the divine.  So if you must pick a religion, pick the one that helps you to understand as well as you can.

Rosacea is a chronic skin disease that comes and goes and is often mistaken for acne. It can cause red patches, lines, and small pimples on the face, as well as burning and irritation in the eyes and eyelids. If treated early, the flare-ups may be minor and controlled fairly well with medication and lifestyle changes. Left untreated, rosacea can progress and eventually cause larger, disfiguring bumps on the nose and face and serious eye problems.. . Fair-skinned people between the ages of 30 and 60 are most likely to develop rosacea. Fewer men than women have rosacea, but men usually have more severe symptoms.. . -Colourgirlie ^_^.

That's a very general statement and it shows bias. Honestly, it depends on the Muslim that you talk to. I know two Muslims who are against terrorism and do not justify it in any way. So, I don't think that all Muslims are brainwashed by the Quran to justify blowing themselves up. I do think, however, that the Quran is far from a sacred book because, when looked into, it DOES justify killing for the spread of Islam (Example: Allah told Muhammad to kill the Quraysh tribe at Mecca because they inhibited the spread of Islam; something like that can never be found in the Bible), and it also justifies the abuse of wives.. So, not all Muslims are crazy or brainwashed by the Quran; the ones I've met are actually quite nice. However, I do think that the Quran isn't a very good book, so Islam is predicated somewhat upon evil. Just my opinion, though.. Again, remember not to make such general, biased statements.

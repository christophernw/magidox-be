experiment. try making a cut-out of the design... use the piece of paper that has the big hole that is your design. use artist tape and tape it to another piece of paper or a wall....make sure the entire piece is taped smoothly. then to make a gradient you start with white paint....on a mixing tray or a plate mix in the smallest amount of blue that you can actually see on your brush. apply to surface. repeat until you are at the orginal shade. try mixing the paints first and make a few practice gradients. Artists work hard to master this. it takes a little while.

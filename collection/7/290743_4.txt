ok just dont ever hit your dog theres never any reason to there innocent so take her over to the spot and point to it and yell no potty outside then take her outside if you catch her doing it then yell no potty outside and take her outside but you have to sound mean and serious when shes bad always use the same voice she prolly never understood that shes supposed to go to the door and cry to go out so its important to take her outside every time you catch her she may be going to the door and its just not noticed sometimes that happens but keep telling your family to do the same also if a dog has to many bosses then shell always be confused on whos the boss so you could try to have your family yell for you or your spouse whenever they catch her try both update me if you want when she does go potty out side praise her and give her treats shell always want to go potty

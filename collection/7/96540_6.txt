Goo-gone has to be the answer for something that has gotten on your seat.  Armour-all is only for the passenger portion - to keep your passenger close.  Of. course, if you gun it, they might go the otehr way!. . But thinking about your problem, it seems that the vinyl might be melting away - perhaps some solvent (gasoline?) got on the seat.  Maybe its time to rip off the old vinyl and have a new cover put on the seat -- or even to have a nice Corbin or Sargent seat put on.. . If all of that is too expensive, there are seat covers that are basically like a little vinyl shower cap, complete with an elastic around the bootom, that you can use to cover the seat.  Maybe you can get one in all-purpose black.

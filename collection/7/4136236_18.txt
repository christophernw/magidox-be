Because they have chose a belief and from there their minds grow more narrow & narrow. Most of the Christian religion emphasizes how it their job to save, their job to spread the gospel, & how bad it is for them to believe anything else... A lot of relions do that. So once they get so narrow, they don't even have an open enough mind to hear about anything else with out flipping out. It's sad for Christians because we are to love, no matter what... being narrow minded doesn't help. RESPECT

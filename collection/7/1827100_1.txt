Their HP numbers are BS.  A performance filter is going to make little to no diffrence.  The reason it is called performance is because it allows more microns of dust into the intake manifold.  Dust in the motor is a bad thing.  . . They will claim to make HP but they don't tell you that the margin of error on the dyno is the same as the HP they are claiming.

Very good question.  I think students shouldn't be able to graduate without a basic knowledge of the law.  I also think they shouldn't be able to graduate high school without a working skill under their belt.  Many can't go to college and get degrees or even want to.  A good technical skill and a reasonable knowledge of what's legal and what's not aren't too much to ask of the Public School System.

They can to this the same way a Christian believes that there IS a god.  There is no factual basis for proving there is a God, you get that "proof" from your faith.  So, if a person does not have that faith, there is no way for them to believe that there IS a God.  Many atheists are based largely in science, accepting only that which they can touch, taste, smell, see as truth and fact.

A virgin girl's vagina has connecting tissue, and when they are penetrated for the first time, this tissue gets broken. Which is why first time sex sometimes hurts for a girl and they bleed. They call it popping the cherry because that's the slang term. You break the wall, and cause a little bleeding.

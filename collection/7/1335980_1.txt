Poorly cooked food (chicken especially, undercooked chicken is the worst thing ever for making you rush to the toilet).. . Poor hygiene before, during and after preparation - ie not washing your hands after going to the toilet, preparing raw chicken and then something else afterwards on the same surface without cleaning it.  Also, leaving raw chicken on the top shelf of the fridge dripping on other raw food beneath it.. . I ate a chicken sandwich from a rest stop on a freeway in England, and sure enough, 12 hours later, I was in the bathroom almost constantly for the next 2 days!  You don't need the details, trust me, I was very very sick!

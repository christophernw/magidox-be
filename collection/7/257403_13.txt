My company paid the bill on the only occasion I ever attempted to eat  frog legs.  I was on a business trip with a co-worker, and he suggested we try them.  I said, "Why not," and we did.  These particular frog legs were tough, and they didn't taste like any chicken I've ever had.  Based on that experience, I don't recommend them.. . I don't know whether these frog legs tried to jump out of the frying pan, but I wouldn't have been surprised if they did that and walked around some, too.  They were that tough.

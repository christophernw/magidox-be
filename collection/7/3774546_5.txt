It all depends on your height. You can be 5'1 and weight 120 and look really fat, while another person the exact same weight or even 130 with a hight of 6'1 will look really skinny even anorexic, so it all depends on your weight. . You will be considered fat whenever you start having extra fat tissue,mostly on your arms, and tummy, or when you look all swall up...

Yes it is high, but don't gripe too much, as it is over $5 in great Britian, and around same in Germany, - even higher in some other places!!  It would probably be much higher here too, - if we didn't have some capacity to produce "home grown" peteroleum.. . If you cut out the speculaters,. and just let the prices flow with the market, you would have price changes every couple days, but the over all adverage would probably be much lower thatn it is! . . This is not all the oil companies fault eiteher, when they are paying high prices for the oil, they have to pass it on, (or they go broke), - and then there is no gas available!. . And of course don't forget your "precious government" eitehr, - in most states more than 50 cents is collected on each gallon in taxes!. . There is literally nobody that you can "shoot with a magic bullet" and cure the problem!. . By the way Brazill's opionion is "up yours America"!!

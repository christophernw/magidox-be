Bipolar is a mental disorder in the brain that is caused by a chemical imbalance. The disorder is charactorized by the rapid cycling of moods. A bipolar person will rapidly cycle between a feeling a uphoria also known as a manic phase and then cycle into a depression state which is known as depressive. The "normal" person (if there is even one) experiances a cycle of highs and lows but the bipolar individual cycles much more rapidly between the two phases. There are medications to control the cycling but there is no single treatment for all. There are many different types of med's to control the cycling but it is usually through trial and error to find a set of med's that the individual will and can respond to. What works for one may not work for another. it is a very difficult disease to live with, but can be managed with the right meds. There needs to be a good support group in place for the individual. Also a good counselor,psycologist, or therepist is critical in managing the disease. Good luck.

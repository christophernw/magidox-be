You could find one of the latest knock offs of "bills of rights" I know there are several out there.  Like the Disabled Child Bill of Rights, etc... which is more current and means more to the students, have them interperet that first... then refer to the original Bill of Rights.. . You could also have them draft their own Bill of RIghts.

It's also so you can see outside the window if there is a crash. There might be fire or debris blocking one of the exits and you need to be able to see this before you try to get out through that exit. Plus if it is much lighter or darker outside than in the plane, your eyes need to adjust before you can see where you are going, and even though it only takes a couple of seconds, you might not have much time.  Having your eyes already used to the outside lighting will make getting out in an emergency a little bit faster and in an emergency, even a couple of seconds makes a big difference.

All good questions. Bascially, though they will deny it even to themselves, anit-illegal immgrants fear and hate foreigners, esp. "Mexicans.". Of course, lationos are partly responsible for that feeling because they tend to stick to their own kind and refuse to learn English and become Amercanized. They want the better pay and living conditions without the factors that make them possible. . It's like giving Americans the finger.

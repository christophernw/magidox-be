Yes.  It is visible due to the way sunspots move on the surface. It rotates about once a month.. . [modified below for more info]. Here is a reference for you to verify the answer above.. . "The Sun does indeed rotate. Galileo noted this nearly 400 years ago when he observed sunspots. As you can see from this animation, the apparent motion of the sunspots can be used to determine the rotation speed of the Sun.". http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=615. . Here's link to a short animation showing the rotation, http://collections.ic.gc.ca/universe/sun.html. . Another reference,. "Does the Sun rotate?. Indeed it does, but unlike the Earth or other solid bodies, the gaseous bulk of the Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles." http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q111.html. . Finally, from NASA's "Ask an Astrophysicist" archive,. "Yes, the Sun does rotate. We can observed this by observing sunspots. All sunspots move across the face of the Sun. This motion is part of the general rotation of the Sun on its axis. Observations also indicate that the Sun does not rotate as a solid body, but it spins differentially. That means that it rotates faster at the equator of the Sun and slower at its poles. (The gas giants Jupiter and Saturn also have differential rotation.) The movements of the sunspots indicate that the Sun rotates once every 27 days at the equator, but only once in 31 days at the poles." http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970108a.html

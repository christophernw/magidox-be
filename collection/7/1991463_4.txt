It is the same reason that all Germans were labelled 'evil' after the World Wars. People generalise - when in fact, Hitler's true followers were the Nazis. Most Germans disagreed with their governments, but were unable to speak out against fascism: it would cost their lives. . The same thing is happening here with the Iraq war and America in general. A country's government represents the country, that is why it is so vital for the social side of things to have a good, respectable government. Personally, and now there's nothing against AmericANS, but I do not agree with America as a culture. However, I don't judge all individuals as one. It is just human nature to generalise and feel the need to judge everyone; remember that yes, it IS unfair, but it cannot be avoided as it requires everyone to work as a whole. Communism realised that was impossible years back.

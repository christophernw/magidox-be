i have always known, but was just affraid to come out, i was worried what my best friend of 30 years and my family would think of me..had my first experience with a woman at 25 and thats when i totally realised that this is who i am and this is what i want. in Feb last year at age 39 i met the woman who completes me, our eyes met and we fell madly in love. it took me a while but im out now!!! extremely happy and proud...

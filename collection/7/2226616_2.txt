Field mice are a protected species and if you kill one the RSPCA may prosecute you. Field mice do not want to be behind your fridge or skirting boards.  It is probably trying to find a way out and you should leave your back door open and it will find its way home to its family and friends, who have probably already reported it missing to the mouse police.  Do you want that amount of blood on your hands and hammer.  Shame on you, it has enough trouble avoiding predators without you joining in and robbing an owl of its supper.

Aa shell says: Hamlet had a sealed letter he was to deliver when the three of them got to England, instructing the person who got the letter to kill the person who gave it to them.  Hamlet snuck a peek, knew that R&G didn't know what the letter said, and fixed it so that they'd be killed instead of him.  That's why Claudius was so shocked to see Hamlet back in Denmark--he was sure he'd taken care of him.

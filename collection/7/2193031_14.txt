I think VCR is much better,,Because you can play the tape over and over for thousands time and you will have no problem at all even you can play very old tapes too..But DVD sucks because you keep the Cd's in a very safe place so they don't get any scratches and if they do the DVD will never play them and old Cd's never get played..I don't like DVD at all and I love VCR because its thousand time better and I like to use tapes all the time not stupid Cd's that be stop working at any time,,I have some tapes which are 20 year  old form my grand parent and I swear by GOD they still work good,,Do you think that old CD will work??? I don't think so

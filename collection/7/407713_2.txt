I read this article and it said that most spider bites usually can be cured by simply taking good care of it, keeping the bite clean, and go to your local drug store and pick something up for it.  A cooling cream, or a gel of some sort.  If it does get much worse though and you start having other symptoms such as nausea, headaches, chills, fevers, etc., then call your physician immediately.. . Good luck and I hope you feel better soon!

Eloping would probably not produce a valid Catholic marriage, because it would not be a marriage sanctioned by the Church. Also, the couple would probably not have undergone the prerequiste counseling and classes prior to marriage. So, although the eloped couple would be legally married, they would not be married in the eyes of the Church, and would therefore be merely cohabitating, or "living in sin".

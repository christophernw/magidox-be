Sweetie, i have the same problem but mine is due to health problems, but to answer your question, it is "impossible" to get rid of a big belly in 2 weeks. You need to figure out what is causing your "big belly" ie. child birth, or medical problems  Then you need to talk to your doctor or get on a sensible diet and excercise program.  But the most important thing is be "realistic".  For whatever reason, which you need to find out why you have a big belly, and be real in the fact that it doesn't disappear that "quick"  You need to find a healthy way to fix it which can't be done in 2 weeks and have the understanding that maybe it can't be fixed!  Either way, boost your self-esteem and accept yourself for who and what you are.  If you accept yourself you will find that others will too.

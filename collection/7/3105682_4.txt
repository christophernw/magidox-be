thats a very good question, but its because we as the american public allows them too.....it should be like any other job, if your doing a bad job, you dont get a raise and you get fired... if your doing a good job then alittle raise wont hurt,but if its for the people who voted for you then being reelected should be enough !!!!!!!!!

why are you so sure that the bible is fact? dan brown as well as many others have done extensive research on this topic. people have accepted the bible as truth for centuries because it gives them something to believe. they choose to believe it because they need so badly to believe in something. if it gives you some sense of hope, then by all means believe the bible as fact. but dont knock those that would actually like some proof first.

For one thing, we don't need to speak any other language than English to get by in our daily lives.  All Americans speak it.  It's not like some other countries where different languages are  spoken in different areas and you need to know them to communicate.  Also, some Americans feel that, even when traveling abroad, they don't need to brush up on any of the native tongue before they go because other countries teach English as a second language.  While this may be true in some areas, English isn't as prevalent a language as many Americans assume.  I've stated this before, but even though English is taught in the schools of another country doesn't automatically mean the citizens of said country are fluent in English.  I know people who took Spanish here for years in school, live in areas with high hispanic populations, and still can't speak Spanish.  While Americans don't really need to learn another language, I think it's good to learn some of the basics of one if you're traveling to a country where the people speak it.  I know from experience that the people you speak to in what little of their language you might know are appreciative that you're attempting it.

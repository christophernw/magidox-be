well it depends which vampire folklore u r getting this from really... how a vampire is made changes from text to text. it isnt usually every person a vampire bites that changes... the most popular 'belief' is that the victim has to be drained of blood and then drink the blood of the vampire... so this makes becoming a vampire a little more exclusive... in the centuries past people believed that if a body wasnt buried below 6feet of earth the corpse could come back.... or a cat jumping over a corpse could create a vampire or people commiting suicide... often if someone commited suicide then were buried at a crossroads so when the spirit/body rose it would get confused and not know which way to go.... . . these are just a few though... vampire folklore changes dramatically from county and also country... hope it didnt bore u 2 much lol

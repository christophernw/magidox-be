God began to make Himself invisible to us after sin was committed. . . Although we cannot see Him with our eyes, we can with our hearts. God will not reveal Himself to us until we make it to Heaven. We just have to have faith, until that day. . . If God were to reveal Himself to you, you could not live through it. You must be in spiritual form or be in your glorified body to be able to see God.. . Truyer speaks the twisted words of Satan stating God is not real, then twists it around to say that He is the destroyer. He cannot make up his mind whether God exists or not, can he?

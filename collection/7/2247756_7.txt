yes, you definitly should get her spayed....if she ever got out the last thing you would want is for her to bring more kittens in to this over populated world of cats!. This is done by surgery, the vet will go in and remove the ovaries and/or the uterus, usually this would just be the type of surgery where they can be dropped off in the morning and picked up the same evening

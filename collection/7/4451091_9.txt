Okay, this is a very good question...I do smoke, and if I'm in the car, I will throw my butts out the window.  When I'm anywhere else, I make sure to dispose of the butt properly (put it out and find garbage can).  The reason we do this is 1) it's just a learned behavior that is somehow acceptable for smokers and 2) we don't want cigarette butts in our cars (stinks).  I totally agree that this is a double standard.  I have been advised that cigarette butts DO degrade and/or are picked up by street cleaners.  If I'm in a rural area or at a park, I won't throw it out the window. I guess I have no good answer for you and no good excuses....smokers don't want the smell of cigarette butts in our cars and we prefer to throw them out....but I know this is seemingly pointless, since the average smoker already has clothes, upholstery, and their home smelling like an ashtray anyway.  Sad but true.  Just want to give you the honest answer from someone that knows.

this is a misconception.. . most democrats, including me, support lowering the taxes on the poor, middle class, and small buisinesses. however, we do believe in raising them for the rich and the big buisinesses.. . and we do like economic freedom, but we beleive the government has an obligation and a duty to serve the people with social security and health care and such. hey, it's either that, or we make the buisinesses provide these things which will come from your pay, and they will lay off people, or if you are unemployed or have a job that doesn't provide these services, you will have to pay a fortune for them. so what do you prefer?

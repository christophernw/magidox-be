Hi there ! . Blood contains 3 types of cells which are suspended in the fluid called as "plasma" ! The cells are "white Blood cells" (WBC), Red Blood Cells" (RBC), and platelets !. Plasma contains  different proteins with different functions !  Some proteins help to "stop bleeding", some to fight infections etc etc.. ! . Red Blood cells contain "Haemoglobin"  which transports oxygen to different parts of the body !. White Blood cells are the soldiers of the body which fight against the invading oraganisms like bacteria and viruses !. Platelets with the help of some proteins in the plasma, stop bleeding , wherever or whenver it occurs in the body !. This is the function of the Blood ..in short..... best wishes !

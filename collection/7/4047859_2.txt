Because You Know Who is an evil, power crazed megalomaniac who wants to take over both the muggle and wizarding worlds.  He can't do this when he is dead, therefore he plans to kill Harry, who (it is prophesied) will be the only person who can kill him.  For the person above who said that the prophesy might not be about Harry, if you remember, Dumbledore proved that actually it definately IS about Harry.  . . Originally, it is true that there were two little boys born in July whose parents defied You Know Who three times, and these little boys were Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom.  However, as Dumbledore explains, the fact that Voldemort chose to go after Harry means that it is Harry that the prophecy is about - You Know Who marked Harry as his equal.. . Can't wait for the next book (I can't believe it's the last one!) is supposed to be out 07/07/2007 is it not?

Turn the light off. If all the glass has not been removed from the metal end of the bulb, get it away carefully. Try putting your middle and index fingers in a bit of dry cloth and pressing it firmly against the inside of that section of the bulb still screwed in the area. Move your fingers around in the direction you would normally go were you removing an unbroken bulb. If it doesn't come out, perhaps you could try getting a technician to assist you.. . Good luck :).

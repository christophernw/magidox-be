I think so.  Have you ever considered this...?  Whenever in crisis, a person will naturally cry out "Oh, God!" or "Oh, Jesus!" or "Oh, Lord!"  I believe that every person's heart knows about God and yearns for Him.  When stressed, you don't hear people scream "Buddha help me!" or "Allah save us!"  That is just my belief.  Who do you think puts the natural tendency towards good in our hearts?

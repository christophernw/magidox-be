There are special lights you can buy for seasonal depression. You sit in front of them and they make you feel more like it's sunny. It seems that bipolar meds are very tricky and need constantly to be adjusted till you are stablized. I know it sucks, but try to hang in there. You definitely need a psychologist along with the dr. who gives you your meds.

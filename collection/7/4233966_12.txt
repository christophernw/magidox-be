Why does Mexico throw people in jail for illegally entering Mex?  Beside economics and ignoring the law, there is also the minor detail of Nat'l Security.

Whatever pressure group is swaying the govt to overlook this vital issue of anyone strolling into our country even those here to plan our demise, they better put US survival FIRST.

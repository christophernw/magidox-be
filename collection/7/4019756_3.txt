To worship money is to prioritize it higher than God. I would even go as far as to say that prioritizing it above your family is worshiping it as well. How many people do you know work all day and night for the almighty dollar. I know a lot of people who spend more time with work than with family. Better a shack on the rock than a castle in sand. The LOVE of money is the root of all evil. Don't get me wrong, money is good and is needed for daily life but the LOVE of money is what gets you into trouble.

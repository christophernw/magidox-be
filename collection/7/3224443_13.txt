In the old days--the really old days, it was thought that evil spirits could sneak into the body during a sneeze. (Really!).  So, to keep you safe from those evil spirits, you were given a quick blessing.  (Remember, "bless you" is just short for "God bless you.")  Being blessed of course, the evil spirits would stay away.. . It's weird sounding to us, but that's the origin.

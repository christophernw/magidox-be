make sure you sterilize all bedding, pillows, stuffed animals, coats, hats, and the inside of your car. if your daughter is in daycare, make sure they are sterilizing the cots. my older girls had a bad case of lice from a daycare that was not cleaning the cots. i tried not to use rid because that gets into the blood stream. i used to cut off each indivual hair with the nits. took hours, but worked. after you do this, pull her hair into a pony tail or bun and spray heavily with hair spray...acts like a shield. people will say this does not work, but this worked for me...i heaped mayonaise on my daughters heads, put on shower caps, left them on for 90 minutes, and the lice were smothered. good luck...ohhh, make sure you are also getting the hair on the nape of her neck!!!. mighty1620...i swore if my daughters were sons...i would have shaved their heads!!!!

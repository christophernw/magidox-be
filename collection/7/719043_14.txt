I am Muslim and I believe that there is one God, and he is so great that he cannot ever be compared to any man put on this earth, no matter how good. I believe that Jesus was a prophet, yes, but not God or a son of God. I believe what I believe because this is how I was brought up, but as I got older I started doing research and looked into other religions. I feel much better knowing that what I believe in makes sense - that God cannot be compared to man, as he has done more than any human being could ever do. He is the reason we are here ... not the mans reason.

All my 'white lies' are born from a reall honest :). egazmple: a lie to an old granny living in a neighbourhood "ur pie is the best pie i had ever tasted!" when it all went bad is kind of truth because it usually is really good. So to conclude i think taht sometiems we must lie.As far as a lie doesn't hurn anyone or doesn't do any other kind of harm i think it's ok.

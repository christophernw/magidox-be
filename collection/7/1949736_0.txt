Active transportation can also refer to substances that are carried into the brain across the blood-brain barrier. For example, glucose is actively transported into the brain. I think substances have to be actively transported to prevent harmful substances from entering the brain automatically. Drugs cross the blood-brain barrier because their chemical structure mimics that of substances that are supposed to be transported into the brain.

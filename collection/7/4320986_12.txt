Mature adults don't require the Threat of Divine Punishment to do the Right Thing. The Social Contract is the basic concept of this. If you do whatever you want, without considering anyone else's feelings, they will not support you when you need their help. This is just one way to look at it. Most atheists do what is right because morality and ethics do NOT require any particular religion, not because they fear God or social abandonment.

In the field that i was interested i had no experience.Only personal experience. One day i called a number in the paper and i asked. How do get experience if I don't have any? He said I'll train you. I worked for him for a year then left and went to a more established company. Maybe it was luck but i think it was that i wanted it so bad i figured it wouldn't hurt to call and ask. Now I've been in my line of work for eight years. You could get experience through volunteering. There is also life experience.

Wear shoes and socks everyday (not flipflops). Scrub with pumice stone or other similar product (don't use that deadly razor thingie). Shower before you go to bed, then put lotion on and then socks and go to sleep with socks on.. . You should notice a difference in a couple of weeks. If not, go see a podiatrist.

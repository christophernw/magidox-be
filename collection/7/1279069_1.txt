I tell my sissy as$ to suck it up because life's to short to mope and no one likes a fairy cupcake princess who cries out of his face vagina. I delt with depression when I was younger, but I decided I don't want to live that way. I figured that people only feel sorry for themselves because no one else will and I'm tired of being weak. I stopped focusing on the negative and found somethings to live for. It's a phase and you'll come out of it just fine. Don't give up because it's for losers, you've got your whole life ahead of you.

There are some credit cards which provide checks - and usually those checks are provided to credit card holders who are in good standing and pay their credit card/s on time.. If you are one of those who does pay their credit cards on time, find out if the bank or institution will provide you with checks - usually four - and you can use those checks as cash, or to pay off another credit card - in other words - consolidate.  You will be charged fees if you decide to use these checks and you will see them on your credit card bill.. Using these checks might be a bit cheaper if you need a cash advance, but don't want to pay the fees for a cash advance by using the actual credit card,  but I am not 100% certain on this, so be certain to do some homework here.

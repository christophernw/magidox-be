This is very relevant to my life.  Once, I could juggle 5,6,7 balls and all kinds of crap.  Then, due to a death in the family 25 years ago, I stopped.  Just last week, a friend and I went to the park.  He had some swords, and we decided to juggle like the good old days.  I should have started with beanbags, though.  I lost both arms, and now am typing with my nose.

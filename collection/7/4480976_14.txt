There are infact many black corporations in the wrold they just might not be well known....white ppl are responsible for many of the thigns that happen in african nations becuase of there licentious acts (slavery, theft..etc) african nations started to fall apart and before you say they couldve fought back, well no they couldnt have Africa before it was the raging war zone it is today was a very peacful palce and there was ultimatley no violnce what-so-ever, the white ppl also stole there means of money and ultimatly how they would be able to trade with other countries for food and would also hem there chances at being able to buy new technology such as the filters that make salt water drinkable and the other techonolgies we use to make things easier, cleaner and healthier hence why africa has water and food problems, now im not saying black ppl shouldnt help becuase we should (im am always donating and have visited africa the past 3 summers to help out) and when they (africans) came over here they saw that in america it was more an I thing as opposed to an "We" thing;something they were very used to and decided that everyman for itself was the way to go,whihc could also be why blacks dont tend to help each other out, becuase we feel and are taught depend on no one but your self and may feel that those idivisuals should find a way to make things happen on there own ruinning each other becuase we still see it as some compettiion:who can get out first.

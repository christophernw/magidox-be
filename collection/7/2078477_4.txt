light always travels at a speed of 299,792,458 meters per second.  . The speed of sound actuall varies depending upon temperature, altitude, and many other things.  . HEre is a formula i got from a website:. . . "Speed of Sound . You can measure the speed of sound the same way you measure the speed of a runner, with a stopwatch on a closed track.. . Find a place where you can hear a good echo, and stand a known distance from whatever the sound is reflecting off of. . Fire a starter's pistol and start the stopwatch. Stop the watch when you hear the echo. . Divide 2 times the distance (it's a round trip) by the time to get the speed.. . At 21 degrees C (70Â°F), you should get 344 meters per second, or 1129 ft per second. At freezing, the numbers are 331 m/s or 1087 ft/s. The proper formula for the change in speed due to temperature is:. . . . Where T is degrees Celsius. The works out to about a 0.1% change per degree Fahrenheit.. . The Speed of sound in water is 1480 m/s or 4856 ft/s. More than 3000 miles per hour."

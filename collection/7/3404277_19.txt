Some religions say that pork is unclean, not because of  where it lives or how it eats, but because a pig does not sweat and rid itself of impurities.  The cloven hoof theory came much later and probably out of ignorance, they do believe it to be of the devil, but that is of course all negated in the new testament of the the bible.  That all things are from God, and it is what comes out of the mouth of a man that defiles a man.   Blessings.

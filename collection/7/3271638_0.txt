GM has been the largest car maker in the world for 70 or more years now and used to be able to sell anything no matter what it was.  Old saying used to be "How goes GM is how goes the U.S."  This was very true as when GM was doing good so was the rest of the country.  I think that the biggest problem now though is twofold.  First is that they have been using cheap parts and fittings to save cost because like Ford they are saddled with massive debt related to medical and retirement benefits that the foreign automakers don't have.  This adds around 1500 bucks to each of their cars in production costs.  Second is that now that they have realized that they are beating a dead horse with this tactic of building junk and hoping for the best, they are still tied up in massive inventory of crap parts that they have to use.  The funds are not there to simply ditch the junk and start over as GM and Ford are both just hovering away from Bankrupcy.  THey both seem to be making an effort to improve this, but seems to be going too slow for the buying public.  I know that while I drive Chevrolet vehicles and have been doing so mostly for some years, I would not buy a new one as for the same money would go with Honda, or some other company.  Exception to this is Saturn that seems to be a bit better than most of other GM in this regard.  Others might disagree with me on that though.  Regardless look for Chevy and the rest of GM to continue to have problems as Ford will as well for some time.  Both have also tied up so much investment into the huge SUV and trucks that they are way behind on what the public really needs, which is fuel efficient, dependable, and safe transportation.  The days of simply making a vehicle "Big" to make it safe are long over as the price of fuel doesn't give us that luxiry.  I have a Diesel Chevy truck for hauling and towing, and other stuff, but am using a Mitsubishi for everyday running around as 33 miles per gallon saves a lot of cash.

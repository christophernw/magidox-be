Christians believe in Jesus Christ as their lord and savior. and that he died on the cross for our sins. you might already be a Christian and not know it. see Christianity isn't one specific religion. there are catholics, baptists, umm non denominational and a few more. being a christian means that you believe that God so loved the world that he gave his only son. and that you want to go to heaven for your eternal rest. i find that being a christian gives my life purpose. so read up and see what makes you happy inside. and don't let people push you into anything that you don't want. you will know when you find the right religion and right church. you will just feel it. good luck!

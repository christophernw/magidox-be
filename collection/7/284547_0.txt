Limit Order is restricted by the price you wish to buy it for. That is the maximum price you are willing to pay for the stock. This is different from a "Market Order" which means you buy the stock at the current price in the market, no matter what that price is, as long as you have money left in your account.. . Both kinds of orders are obviously limited by the amount of funds you have remaining in your account

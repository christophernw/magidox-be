The government rarely steals our money. In fact, a lot of people give the government more money than they need to. The government spends money the way we elect them. If we like getting pork, we get pork. If we like having our president go to war, we spend it on war. If we like Presidents who favor the rich, it gets spent on the rich. If we like presidents who say "cut taxes" while spending like crazy, we get trillion-dollar deficits, which our children will have to pay, or China will foreclose on the US.

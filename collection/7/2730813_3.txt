The U.S. Secret Service is a branch of the Treasury Department, and is under the directorship of the Secretary of the Treasury. The USSS was originally formed  to combat counterfeiting of U.S. currency. Prsidential protection came at a much later time.Not all Secret Service enforcement personnel are Special Agents. The uniformed branch of the USSS are nothing more than security guards. They don't usually go out into the field, nor investigative work.

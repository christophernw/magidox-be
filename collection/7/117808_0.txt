I THINK WHEN YOU PLUG IN THE IPOD ITUNES POPS UP, WHEN IT OPENS UP ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN THERE WILL BE A PICTURE ICON THAT LOOKS LIKE A IPOD. CLICK IT ANOTHER SCREEN WILL POP UP. YOU HAVE TO READ IT WHERE IT SAYS DOWNLOAD MANUALLY, WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO SELECT THE SONGS YOU DONT WANT AND NEW ONES TO REPLACE THOSE. SINCE YOU ALL HAVE DIFFERENT TASTE IN MUSIC OU GUYS HAVE TO SAVE YOUR MUSIC BY IMPORTING IT UNDER YOUR OWN IPOD MUSIC FILE AFTER THAT NO MORE WORRIES.

To change your mind about something, even if you don't have the power to over-come it you still want to. Do the best you can to change, keep asking for forgiveness(HE WILL FORGIVE YOU) then, get more of JESUS in your SOUL(renew your mind) by reading the BIBLE more. Strange, if you get enough JESUS in you, you won't have to try to quit sinning, the sinning will LEAVE YOU!!! (all by-it's self)!!!!!!!!!! Read the part in the BIBLE about forgiving your brother, 7x70----GOD has alot of MERCY!!!

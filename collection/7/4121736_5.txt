Petty bickering does divide the ranks...but bipartisan politics is actually designed to narrow our interests into one vs the other, and not allow for other candidates room.. . Consider how efficiently it was manipulated when there were two members of Skull and Bones, cousins Dubya and Kerry, two cheeks of the same @$$ on the previous election.. . Taught for generations that "Votes for an independant is like throwing your vote away", the voters believe this and choose the lesser of two evils, rather than actively seeking out any alternative, independant candidate.. . Furthermore, the air time allowed for politics is highly dependent upon money. Yes, money - through donations, sock fund money, trusts, businesses - and business partners who enter into politics to forward their multi-billion dollar enterprises.. . There are so many millions of layers upon layers of interrelated and inherent problems that have infected our nation - a nation founded by the finest ideals - that it is becoming increasingly difficult to form a solid solution.. . Then - there's the mass media. ClearChannel Communications and Murdoch's other enterprises. More nested centers of multi-billion dollar businesses - it's all business.. . Gay rights vs the Patriot Act. Social programs vs the Military Commissions Act. Show one problem, show one celebrity marriage/divorce/cleavage, and neglect to show matters being actively voted on - Net Neutrality..... . Yes, we see it, after actively looking at it....just like the magician who waves his handkercheif in one hand, and the smart kid who watches the other hand reaching under the enclosed table, we see that there are mechanisms that we're not "supposed" to see.... . The question *should* be...what do we plan to do about it?. . Shutting up, . -the_kcar-

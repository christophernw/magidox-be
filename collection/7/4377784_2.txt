A front elevation is an elevation of a piece of scenery or properties from the front view.  It show dimensions and can be drafted or quickly drawn if not to major a piece.  A painter's elevation for the front would show the same object, with dimensions, to scale, (preferably 1/2") in color so the scenic artists could paint it

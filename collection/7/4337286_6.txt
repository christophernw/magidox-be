We all have different body shapes, the most effective way to lose fat is to watch your diet, try eating about 5 to 6 smaller meals a day with a serve of protein in each meal, the protein helps you to stay feeling full for longer, good protein sources are a small hand full of nuts, an egg, low fat cheese's such as cottage cheese, low fat yoghurts and protein shakes made with fruit and low fat or skim milk, this way you don't get hungry and then pig out on the wrong foods, stay away from processed foods as much as you can and try to drink plenty of water..      You sound like you get some exercise each week, which is great but if you want to lose weight faster you will have to do a bit more, calories in and calories out, in other words the more calories you burn off the faster you will lose weight, also try doing some resistant training,( lifting weights ) you can do this while you are watching TV and having some muscle tone helps to burn fat a lot faster by increasing your metabolism. .       Good Luck.

if you have something in mind for a career it would be great to have some hands on training for that career-example you intend on going to college to be a vet-a summer job with your local vet would give you hands on experience looks good on a resume too.if they do not wish to hire you could  volunteer for a day  or two a week.and they may even like your work so much that they will hire you on as a part of their  team!of course you will want to consider the career of your choice.good luck.

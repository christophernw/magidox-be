My oler dog started doing this.I would ask your vet to examine her.I think it may just come with age but get her checked to be sure.I use "old roy" bedding pads.I bought some at Wal-mart in the pet department.They are cheap enough & work great.They catch most of the flow if not all of it,,then you just roll it up & toss it.I also use baby wipes to clean my dog between baths.

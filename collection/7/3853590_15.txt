Jews are not always attacked, every race and religion are attacked.  They were not the first to experience an Holocaust.  The Africans that were brought to America as salves lost more lives on the trip to America than the entire Holocaust.  That not to say one is better then the other but where are you that you see Jews who you can only recognize by name are picked on. Christianity and Islam both have the same beginning as Judaism, but Christians believed that Christ came and changed how they should worship.  Islam was practiced by the son of Abraham people.

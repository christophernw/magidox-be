The planets of our solar system formed in a dense region within an immense cloud of interstellar gas and dust. The region where Earth and the other planets formed was slowly rotating, and as material was gathered in by the forming planets, each of them acquired some of that rotation. So it is that, except for Venus, all the planets of our solar system rotate in the same direction. This direction of rotation could have been opposite to what we have today if the original cloud had been rotating differently.

Everything we do or think is dictated by a neurologic pathway.  These pathways are a series or neurons that are in a ordered sequence so that if the preceding neuron is brought to threshold it will create a stimulus to the next neuron in that series.  These electro-chemical discharges of energy underlie everything we experience.  Jealousy/fear/anger...are survival emotions that are mostly influenced by the limbic areas of brain.  These areas are a collection of neurons with a similar function.  that provide us with a reflexogenic reaction to certain situations in an effort to protect us.

It's a term used in statistics to seperate the data and show distribution, ie. if you were collecting data on say ages of people with cancer, and you had ages from 1 to 100, then the 1st quartile would be the group of ages 1-25, 2nd is 26-50, and so on, then you could look at this data and see if there's more people in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th, or make some conclusions about whatever it is that you may be measuring or collecting data on.

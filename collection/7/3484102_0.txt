Pay attention to the kids, meybe take a certification class, and ask questions of what the parents expects of you. From personal experience, doing dishes and neatening up and messes is a great way to get the parents to be happier when they come home too ;) And to get them to eat things like fruit, sprinkle a tiny bit of suger on them and call em 'candied'.

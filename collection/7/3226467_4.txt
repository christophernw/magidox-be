Marco Polo.... . This most popular of swimming games owes it's name to the Venetian explorer of the late 1200s and early 1300s whose travels to China, India and other parts of Asia helped to introduce the "mysterious Orient" to Western Europe.. Legend says that Marco Polo did not know where he was going when he first set out on his travels- hence the game's name.

I think you both were rude.  :). . Seriously.  . . Christians who push their faith on people are very rude.  . . But you shouldn't lower yourself to their level by telling them off.  . . Next time, prove you are better the better person by gracefully escaping.. . Also, forgive yourself and call this a learning experience.  . . Most of us have had lapses in judgment when accosted by over enthusiastic Christians.  I remember I opened my door to find a Jehovah Witness asking "Do you believe in hell?" and my response was "I believe I'm in Hell as we speak!" then slammed the door in her face.  That was terrible of me!  (But funny too.)  . . My learning from that experience was the most important thing.  There are better ways to get people out of our faces without being rude.  . . Another thing to remember is that our being rude just validates to them we truly needed saved.  Isn't' that the last thing you want them to think after meeting you?  . . Think about it.  ;)

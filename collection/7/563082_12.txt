People believe in gods because they do not want to believe in the one true God Jesus Christ.  They set up other gods to believe in, false gods known as idols.  An idol can be a car, a house, a job, money, a celebrity, a parent----anything that is not the true God Jesus Christ.  Sometimes people actually pray to these gods, such as in the case of bowing down to statues.  Idolatry is wicked and is of the devil.  These gods have no power and are dumb.  Idolatry leads to damnation because they cannot save a person from their sin.  Only the blood of Jesus saves.

hey, my dog doesnt bark more in night,,but usually dogs bark more in nite coz of dark,,dogs dnt see colors as we do, for them evrythin is black n white, in the nite its already very dark so a slightest noise or a vision creates a curiosity and alerts them about something differnt than usual,,,tats why they start barking until we pay attention to wat they are pointing at!!!

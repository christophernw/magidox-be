Yeah at times you're going to come in contact with someone that's seems a little on the fakish side(Annoying as Hell), but hey that's ANYWHERE. There are a ton of people that live in Houston that are from California, New York, Philly,etc. and that have parents that are from such locations.... such as mine and sometimes the tones and pronounciations might mix... cuz it happens with me. So we're not trying to be anything other than ourselves in this HUGE city. And if someone wants to walk around in an Abercrombie pull over with some flip flops and talk like a "Californian" that's them. What does it matter anyway?.. as long as they're not messin with me. I really wouldn't care.

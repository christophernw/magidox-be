Being bad is the way of the devil, who is inferior to God. God created everything, including the devil.. Now think about it, God invites you to be a shadow of Him, by doing good and spreading joy and good deeds. The devil, who is but a pawn, is asking you to join him in hell, by doing bad stuff, which bring instant joy and pleasure, as well as rapture. . The way of God takes a long time, and a lot of patience, to reach an eternal paradise, that haven't been seen or heard about. The way of the devil brings swift joy, all the time, whatever the cost is, but you'll end up in hell.. Now you know why it's easy to be bad?

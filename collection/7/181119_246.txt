well first of all it depends on how old you. are but anyways, I think a good job would be somwhere with a/c and that pays good enough. like last summer I work at a restraunt as a waitress and I had a blast. but you know a cashier is really fun to you get to meet tuns of ppl. I think those are the best jobs for the summer!

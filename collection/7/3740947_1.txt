It is really had to stop cats from climbing/jumping on your furniture.  It's a cat's natural instinct to climb.  If you really love your cats, you'll just have to live with it or confine them to one room but I'm sure you wouldn't want to do that. The older they get, the less they climb/jumb.  My cats mean more to me than my furniture so they can climb/get on anything they want.

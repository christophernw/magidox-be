If you choose to keep your baby, you can give it the most important thing...love.  One parent who cares is priceless.  . . Since I have a child who is adopted, I will bring up that option.  he has been an absolute blessing to us.  We are forever grateful that we have a chance to have him in our lives.  . . Whatever you think.  Talk to your folks.  You shouldn't have to go through this alone.  Tell them what you told us.. . Whatever your choice, I wish you well.

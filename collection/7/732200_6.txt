Honestly, when I used to go out alot, I'd make sure to eat before i went out.. starchy foods like potatoes, and bread, and then after a few drinks eat some pretzels, or something to soak up some of the alcohol, and then make sure before you go to sleep you drink a glass of water.. it's foolproof(as long as you don't drink enough to give yourself alcohol poisoning)

You could get a cat to catch the mouse, but then you would need to get a dog to catch the cat, which you got to catch the mouse. Then of course you'd need a goat to catch the dog, the dog to catch the cat, the cat to catch the mouse. Then you'd need a cow to catch the goat, the goat you got to catch the dog, the dog you got to catch the cat, the cat, of course to catch the mouse.....I knew an old lady who had a similar problem.....have you thought of getting a mouse trap and some cheese...lol.

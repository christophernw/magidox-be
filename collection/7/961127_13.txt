You, Sir, are an ignorant moron.  It just so happens that I was one of those rocket scientists of the 60s and 70s, and consider myself a Christian.  Science is nothing but the study of and the attempt to explain nature as best we can.  All nature attests to the presence of God.  Also, you now enjoy the ability to do a great many things because of science, including making an ass out of yourself on this computer-driven (read science) forum.  Get a life.

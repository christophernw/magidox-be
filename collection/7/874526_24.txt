Tell your boss you want to be frank with him, tell him how much he sucks, how much the company sucks, the other workers, things are unfair, office politics make things annoying, people don't pull their weight, you feel the company is going down the drain and then say you quit because you can't stand it anymore...unless they pay you more.

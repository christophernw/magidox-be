I have found that no matter what your learning style is, the best way to study effectively enough to pass an exam, or even ACE it entirely, is to use your notes, your textbook, or any other material and TEACH the material to someone else.. . This practice is best achieved in small groups studying for the same purpose!  So, you could use the Jigsaw method, where each person in a small group masters a section/percentage of the material and teaches the other members of the group.. . If you're more of an individual and like to do things on your own, grab a sibling or neighbor and allow them to humor you while you teach them your lesson!. . An important thing to remember is to always ask questions of the teacher whenever necessary!. . Good luck and all the success in the world!

It could simply have been old age...but if it was not fed correctly (they cannot 'make' vitamin C and need special supplements either in their water or special GP pellets that contain vitamin C) this is likely the cause.  Another common situation that this sounds like is bloat/blockage.. . Frankly, when it became lethargic and would not eat, it should have been taken to the vets..... . Lorinne

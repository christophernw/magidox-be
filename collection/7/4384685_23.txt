Truffles are edible fungi that grow mainly at the base of oak trees (but also hazelnut and poplar trees) in the forests of Italy, France, Spain, Croatia, Slovenia, China, and yes, even in the U.S. (the forests of Oregon and Washington). Traditionally, they are painstakingly harvested using trained truffle hunters - pigs. However, because of a pig's affinity for the taste of the truffle, many truffle producers have turned to dogs to root out this delicacy. The slow, laborious, and uncertain process of gathering truffles, coupled with their limited quantities are the primary reasons truffles bear such hefty price tags.

In point of fact, in The 14Th century, Christians were the most ignorant people on the planet. Perhaps you should actually read a history book sometime. . . While it is true that Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle believed in a soul, they also believed in a pantheon of Gods and Goddesses, not a lone creator. Your attempt to reconcile the two philosophies makes no sense unless you are saying that there is more than one God. . . Incidentally, changing the calender is not changing history, just the method in which it is categorized. Jesus Christ was nothing more than an exorcist with a big ego. Many of the disciples abandoned him after the whole "eat of my flesh" incident. Only 12 remained afterward. John-6:53-66. . Did you catch that? All of his disciples, EXCEPT FOR 12 abandoned him. . . Jesus ended up with 12 lackeys, who in turn created a church and gather more followers, who in turn gathered more followers. Are you familiar with how AmWay works? Ever heard the phrase "Pyramid scheme"? "Cult following"?. . If you read human history, you will quickly find that it is irreconcilable with scriptural history. Believe the bronze-age beduins if you choose to, who would have you think the Earth is about 6000 years old now. My money is on the folks who have actually researched history, done the science, and revealed the Bible for what it is.... Folly!. . -SD-

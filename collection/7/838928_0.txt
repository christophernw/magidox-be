They just eliminate waste as usual, although after a three month fast, there isnt much. Penguin colonies on the ice can be some of the stinkiest places on earth. And most of the waste is not large or particularily solid, its fish and squid goo so it freezes fairly quickly. Chicks also eliminate wastes and the parent can move away from the site or if the chick is still young, the poo is in a membrane so it can be picked up and moved.

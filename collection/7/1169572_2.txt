I am not sure you statement is correct about "some people not like jews before they even meet some".  HOwever, if it is true, it is partially because of the Jewish history, the power they had in biblical times, the power they threw away, the fact that they turned their backs on the so called "son of God' destroyed their reputations.  Also, their is a strong bias in the United States (rightly, wrongly, in between, whatever) that Jewish people are selfish, eogcentric, don't care for others, think they are for ridiculous reason more intelligent and that through their (jews) weakenss, they have somehow worked their way up to the most powerful banking systems in the world.  Also, most of the world is getting sick and tired of the UNited states supporting Israel, when the Jewish gov. and people should start holding their own.. World War 11 is over, enough time gone by to stop sympathizing with the holocast and move on.  The Negro Americans have moved on, the Native American indians (the most abused and murdered race in the world) have moved on.  So, why don't hte Jewish people, move on?

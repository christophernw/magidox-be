i don't like the idea of not being in control of my own life. although i do often feel like that, its as though everything i can do has a limit. so i am always sad for imagining a great life which i cannot lead. simply because i come from a poor family and don't have the necessary means to get to the position where i can do the things that i want to. but i still refuse to except that i can't reach the stars. i think you can know what your destiny is by working out all the possibilities.

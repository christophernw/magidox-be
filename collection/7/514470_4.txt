You don't say what the transistor's hfe(min) is.. . But this should sort your problem out.. . From the 555's output pin connect 4k7 to the transistor's base, and 47k from the base to 0V.. . Emitter to 0V.. . Buzzer between collector and +12.. . Contact me by private message if you want.. . ___________________________________________. . I just tried to post the following in answer to your private message, but the syatem says your email address isn't confirmed:. . All you need to do is switch the transistor into saturation.. . To do that you need to ensure that the base current is at least Ic/hfe.. . Since we don't know hfe, let's assume it's 100.. . So the base current needs to be Ic/100 = 2mA, and therefore the base resistor approximately 12 (timer's output)/2 = 6k.. Nearest value 5k6 but use 4k7 just in case hfe is a bit less.. . This will ensure that the transistor is saturated and its dissipation will be Vce(sat)xIc = 0.7x0.2 = 140mW.. . If you start playing about with driving the transistor in a semi-linear mode, as your figures seem to suggest, the dissipation is bound to increase.. . Regards,. David

this is an interesting question.... . a better question is : why are people sticking to any religion?. . what is the reason that you are calling athiests cowards? in my opinion, people who don't believe in god are brave. we are of the belief that we are completely in charge of our lives. that's a very scary thought for most people. most people can't deal with the thought that there is no one watching them, no one helping them. i go through life, day by day, believing that i am all alone. could you deal with that idea? probably not. you need god. you need your religion. you need to be told how to act and what to think. you need to be guided and watched. why is that? what is so wrong with us thinking that we can do it by ourselves. because guess, what i can do it by myself.. . now about your mommy not letting you send it... either your 14 or your a grown person who does everything that your mommy tells you (which furthermore proves that you can't live your life by yourself).. . if you want to send it, send it. but if it's anything short of god himself knocking on my door and performing a "MIRACLE" right in front of me... it won't change my mind.

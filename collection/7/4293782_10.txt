Once you've gotten a good amount of fat off of there, you can focus more on crunches, situps, and the sort. Remember to do those situps whenver you bike or swim too. But when you've gotten more of the fat off, then you can worry about toning. Rapid sets will help you to tone, slow sets will help you to gain mass in the abdominals.

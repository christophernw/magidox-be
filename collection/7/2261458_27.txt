Oh man, I feel bad for you. My bird died last year, and I had him for a while and I loved him alot too. I waited about two months to get a new bird, and it helped alot. I love my new bird alot and almost as much as I loved my old bird. Just wait a little while and then get a new bird and you will love it just as much! Good luck!

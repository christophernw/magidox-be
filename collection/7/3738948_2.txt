If you had an abscess, you would know it.  The entire side of your face would be swollen, and even your sinuses would be sore.  It is probably just a sensetive tooth.  Unless it has a giant cavity or you have severe peridontal disease (like trench mouth) there really isn't any way for bacteria to get into the pulp of the tooth and cause an abscess.  I wouldn't put too much into the lymph node thing, they can get swollen if you have a head cold or are starting to get the flu.  Like you, I'm not a dentist, but that is my semi professional opinion.

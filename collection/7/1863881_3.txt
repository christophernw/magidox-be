A contemplative life is basically saying that consciousness adds complexities to life that would not be available to you if you were a lower life form. The ability to reflect on things qualitatively enhances things such as a piece of fine art or a beautiful musical masterpiece. The ability to contemplate it and reflect on it adds quality and appreciation to it that we as rational and thinking human beings would not otherwise have. Looking at my dog he seems to have a good life because his life is so simple, however I would not change places with him however tempting it may be because he is not capable of achieving the variety of pleasures and levels of happiness that I am.

i have been a teacher for 21 years and yes there are burn out times, but i have learned that you must set time for yourself everyday to just be alone and gather your thoughts, i personally take 15 min. when i come home just for me sitting outside or just listening to calming music, my children at home have learned that this is important for me. also just always use laughter daily. teaching is a passion we dont do it for the money

clean houses. you can get up to 10 bucks an hour. work for family, they'll usually pay you more. babysitting can get you five bucks an hour, two bucks per child. you could get a job at stores, but not a better idea because they pay you minimum wage and you have to go most days of the week in the summer, depending. ask some good friends to donate into a cash fund. make sure when you get the bus ticket to bring a "weapon" of some sort so creepy guys don't bother you. i suggest a LARGE bottle of hairspray and a lighter in your lap on your way there and back. carry it around when your by yourself too. have fun.

It is a fundamental law of physics. If you start creating or destroying energy you pretty much destroy all of physics as we know it.. It's important to say "as we know it" becuase all of phyics is EMPIRICAL. This means "as we see it, we try to explain it". So.. Einstein came up with e=mc^2. It is called the Mass/energy relationship. e=energy. m=mass. c=speed of light. So you can see if there is mass there is energy. . I said at the top AS WE KNOW IT because it may be that energy and mass can be created or destroyed. They have discovered that our universe is heavier than it should be. However this could be mass from objects of neighbouring expanding universes which although are actually there we cannot see them as they travel in a different time vector associated with their own big bangs. . So yes.. Energy cannot be... . But Also Energy may well be able to ......

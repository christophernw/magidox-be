The actual term is "Posse Comitatus" (but you're not to be blamed for catching it wrong on one utterance from a TV show). It refers to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878.. . The essence of Posse Comitatus is to keep the federal government from using military forces for enforcing domestic (US) law, or acting as police inside the United States.. . The Posse Comitatus Act was adopted during Reconstruction out of concern that the north was abusing the use of the army to "supervise" elections in the south (i.e. intimidating voters to make sure the elections came out the "right" way).. . If you're familiar with what we now think of as "Third World" countries, you're aware of situations in which the military has taken over the government through coup d'etat, or in which governments have preserved their power versus reform or revolution by calling out the army to suppress dissent. Posse Comitatus is intended to prevent that kind of thing.

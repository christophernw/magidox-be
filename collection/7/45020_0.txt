for me personally, going to the gym makes me work harder than i would if i just went for a walk. being able to do weights and cardio all at the same time in the same place (where there is air conditioning) is beneficial. also, having a trainer there to kick my a*s when i need her to is a godsend. besides that, there are alot of goodlooking people to watch!

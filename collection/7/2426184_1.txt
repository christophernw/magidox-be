well first is quality of the products themselves, manufaturers in particular and specs of each piece of equipment, make sure that they are wired in correctly and if you have noise problems with anything like through the head unit. wire a ground away from where the stock one is mounted and to a bare metal spot, rca' quality also, you can buy the cheap one's and it will work but spend a little more money and upgrade them will get you better sound quality, if you have a little more than enough power to run the high's in your car, if you have upgraded those as well, you can get sgli's and install them on the end to where the rca's hook up and the sound will be purer and clean, all they do is filter out noise. make sure your head unit doesn't suck either. i choose either pioneer or jvc. there's a few other one's but for the price and quality i stick with them

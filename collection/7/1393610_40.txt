The difference is this: Hoover thought the Economy would fix itself; in addition, Hoover wanted to American People to rely on themselves and not on the Government for help.  You may remember that in the previous World War (WWI) the Government did promise an eventual "bonus" for those who participated in the war.  This promise was never kept when the Stock Market Crashed and the Soldiers marched to Washington, D.C. to demand payment.  Hoover responded with military force.. FDR wanted to help the public by setting Government Programs (FDRs Alphabet Soup) such as the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), Agricultural Adjustment Administration, Electrification Administration (EA) and other programs helped the public producing government/public jobs.  You can say that FDR wanted more Government control over the Economy and with public health.

Dear Dave. . In answer to your legal question regarding the question of the Capitol of Washington DC, I should think that if President Bush and the whole of the USA are logged into this web site, they will all be having a good laugh at your question.. . However, to answer your question on behalf of The President & The White House:-. . Washington in The District of Columbia is the Capitol of The United States of America and although Washington DC is not a State in the USA, it is the Administrative Capitol for the whole of The United States of America.. . I therefore trust that this answer's your legal question.. . Regards. . MR STEVEN NEWBERT JP. HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN'S. JUSTICE OF THE PEACE. for. ENGLAND & WALES. and. SENIOR QUEEN'S MAGISTRATE. between. THE UNITED KINGDOM of GREAT BRITAIN. and. THE UNITED STATES of AMERICA

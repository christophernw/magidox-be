Dear AMBERPATIENCE:. . You are very patient and it is true that there is nothing wrong with having things in two languages...it's the cost of having things in 200 languages that is a problem. Who's to say which the second language should be? Spanish? What about Chinese immigrants? Japanese? French? Swahili? Why should we spend so much taxpayer money on making government forms, etc in so many different languages? Afterall, if we give spanish speaking persons the forms in spanish, it would be unfair to not do the same for all languages.

Well, to be honest, I was raised as a Mormon, so that's initially how I became one.  However, through faith and prayer, I have gained a testimony, and I know that I'm where I'm supposed to be.. . I suppose some people say that I was "brainwashed" simply because I was raised that way, but I do not feel that I was.  I have always had the freedom to choose whether or not I practiced the Mormon religion.  I chose to, because I gained a testimony, and knew that it was true.

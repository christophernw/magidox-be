its human nature and instinct to stereotype bassed on appearance.  every look has a stereotyped persona with it.  you see someone with piercings and tats and black hair and black baggy pants and torn shirt what do you think of?  when you see someone in a suit what do you think of? you see where im going with this.  whether we mean to or not, it happens to some degree or another.  what do you think of when you see an army soldier or a marine?  the war?  or doing something good in the world.

Firstly you have to define which religion you are talking about Generally in the main monotheistic (one god) religions being Judeo/Christian and Islam they explain it as God was never born, he is and was and always will be. he calls himself "I am".. . God is considered the creator of all things, so consider that if something Created God then God would not be God.

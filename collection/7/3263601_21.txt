Careful with some of the suggestion son how to get him out.. If they think you are crazy, then they lable you a crazy and you get dischagred as crazy.  That label then sticks with you the rest of your life, even if you get other psych evals, it is always on military record which can be accessed through your social security number.  Future employers can refuse to hire you if they feel you may pose a possible threat to their business.  Contacting the ACLU won't do you any good either, you can sign up for the MArines as early as 16, the legal age you can drop out of High School on your own.  They didn't lie, he just wasn't smart enough to read the paper work.  Don't go with that angle either, being labeled mentally retarded is worse then crazy.

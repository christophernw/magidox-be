It's not that there's MORE persay, just that it's more acceptable than it used to be, so they are more comfortable with being public about it.  You are more aware of it today than people were years ago because they no longer fear for their lives.  Also, some people who claim they are gay, aren't really.  They just are for attention.  I knew this one girl who claimed she was bi because she wanted attention.  That's just the kind of person she is.

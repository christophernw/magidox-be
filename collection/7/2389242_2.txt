ok, say your in a car with me and im not wearing my safety belt.  something happens and we get into an accident, the car rolls, and since im not wearing my belt, i roll on you with the force of the speed the car is traveling, and rolling.  i kill you.  still want me to have my own choice? or do you want to live?

These reflexive responses are caused by blurred REM (dream) caused by waking up quickly. Essentially, your dreams/thoughts are momentarily transferred to your conscious mind and you act on those thoughts as if they were actually occurring. I dream about soccer sometimes and wake-up to painful kick at the wall :-).

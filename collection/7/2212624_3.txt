Convince your wife to go back to the doctor if she's not been already. Perhaps she is in denial? It happens as she may be trying to pretend that everything is ok, to you and to herself. She needs support which you are giving her but make sure she knows you are there for her every step of the way. I hope this helps you a bit.

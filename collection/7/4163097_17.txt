Wow, I think we are up to at leasst ten repeats on this question.  Thus far none of you have read his full comments, or, if you have read them, understood them.  It was a convoluted and rather pitiful attempt to point out that if you do not really study history you will repeat it's mistakes the way President Bush has done in Iraq.  He was not calling the troops dumb, he was calling President Bush stupid for the way he has handled Iraq.  It was a pitiful attempt but you guys have twisted it all out of proportion.  Just as the administration has.  Luckily, whether you like Kerry or not, it has moved the focus back to Iraq.  That can never be a good thing for this administration.. . And folks, if the best you can do is quote Drudge, O'Reilly or Limbaugh well, then you are in a really sad spot.

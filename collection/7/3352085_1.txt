It's very simple you know, you got 3 ways to do it.. . 1. If you know it's harmless, then do it urself. . 2. If it is dangerous, how on earth haven't you called for help as of yet? Call Animal/Pet Control and quick. . 3. Spread the word in your neighbourhood, someone might be able to help you out. . 4. Sponsor me a ticket and visa (i'll do it for u lol)

Criminal you can go to jail and civil is only for monetary punishment. You cant go to jail with a civil law suit. For example, O.J. Simpson won the criminal trial and was found not guilty, so he had no jail time. But the family sued him in a civil case and won, so O.J. had to pay them money because he was found guilty.

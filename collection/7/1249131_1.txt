If you don't want to go to her parents, how about a school counselor? Or a minister.  You really need to get an adult in your community involved.  Do you have a suicide intervention line in your town.  Or perhaps your local hospital has a number.  Also check any Mental Health facility in your area.  Good luck.  I know how scared you are for your friend.

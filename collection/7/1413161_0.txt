either you will have to get motivated. Just start walking! Even if the walk is for 20 or maybe 15 min! Their are diets that you could do. Like slim fast. You could look online for different diets. Once you choose the diet you can go by then you will have to stick to it ! to the T! It will take some time to have your stomach get smaller. Plus you have to eat in smaller portions! My husband can eat a whole container of ice cream! That is NOT good! I keep telling him that he has to eat in smaller portions & not large! Exersize is the main thing tho! GOOD LUCK!

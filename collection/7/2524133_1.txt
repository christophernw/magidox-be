It would worry me to worship a God with split personalities.  I find it funny how Christians read the bible with rose colored glasses and ignore all truth.. But to each his own.  I don't want to pushed into believing and won't push others not to.  I just think the whole thing with the Bible is a joke.. My belief... Jesus was the Manson of his time.

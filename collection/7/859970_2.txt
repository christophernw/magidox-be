Well slavery was wrong, we all know that for a fact. But remember, the south was mainly agricultural so they depended on slaves to help them harvest and work the fields. The northern states were very induatrializen in their economies. But remember also, after slavery was outlawed in the constitiution many former slaves were EMPLOYED by their former masters. But i would do alot more research.

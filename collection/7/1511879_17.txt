My son is ADHD; he is 20 years old now.I was diagnosed at 42 with it. The best and only way is to get a diagnosis from a qualified doctor. You and others can guess all you want but a good doc is indispensable.. Depending on child's age, your pediatrician or regular doc can get you started. Talking to school officials is a good first step. There are many community based places that you can call. Catholic charities; Mental health; Welfare dept.;The hospital in your area may give you a list of doctors in your area.All of these places SHOULD be able to steer you to a good Doc.They are sources. . Don't give up and don't be backward in asking questions. You are not alone. There are some excellent parents focus groups out there. Not all children with ADD/ADHD need meds to control. This is a neurological disorder but; Sometimes it is something as simple as diet.You won't know until your child sees a doctor and gets tested.Do not mess with this. If you think your child has a problem do not let any one talk you out of getting her checked. I have lived my entire life wondering what was the matter with me. I cried for days after I was diagnosed. At least now I have something to deal with. There is a lot of help out there but most of it is self sot.Good luck.

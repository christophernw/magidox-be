When you have a neighborhood with a high rate of joblessness you are faced with a populace who becomes more concerned with a roof over their head and food on the table than any more esoteric concerns......referring back to Maslow's hierarchy of needs----safety issues and basic physical issues come before abstractions.  Its hard to get excited about say, litter or vandalism or even school or tax issues when you are worried about feeding your family.

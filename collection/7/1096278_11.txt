Most people choose to follow the religion that is most familiar to them, the one they were born with.  Of those who choose a different religion, they have many reasons.  . . Usually, it probably starts with seeing flaws in the religion they grew up with.  Perhaps they see hypocrisy, contradictions in the scripture or doctrines, or just generally don't feel that the religion appropriately addresses human needs.  So then they may look at other religions and see if another one meets these needs better.  . . One going from Christianity to Judaism usually sees inconsistencies between the Old and New Testaments.  I know because I myself went down that path, and heard from others who did the same.  So it was all about finding the truth of the Scriptures.. . Some choose Islam in such a case, because, seeing inconsistencies in the Bible, they are impressed with the more unified message of the Qur'an.  And perhaps they see it as preserving a truer Monotheism.. . I myself have chosen Hinduism after many years of study of other religions.  I chose it because I was so drawn to what I found in its scriptures.  I felt that they had genuine insight into human nature, and the devotional relationship that one had with God.  I have a very strong sense of devotion, and always have.  I found that Hinduism was one of the most devotional religions out there.  So I think I was just drawn to it for that reason among others.

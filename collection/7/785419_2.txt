I expect they went right on making candles, although frankly, this was mostly a home task and not a profession.  There were candle shops in the larger cities, but most farmers and other country folk just made their own.  If the man who ran the candle shop went off to war, his wife probably continued making candles to keep the family in cash.  . . I'm curious what made you ask the question.  Why candle makers specifically?

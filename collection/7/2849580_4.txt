There were some misunderstandings between the Jewish and Gentile Christians in Rome. Worried Jewish Christians were asking Paul,"Does faith wipe out everything Judaism stands for? Does it cancel our Scriptures, put an end to our customs, declare that God is no longer working through us?" (This is essentially the question used to open chapter 3)"Absolutely not!"says Paul. When we understand the way of salvation through faith, we understand the Jewish religion better. We know why Abraham was chosen, why the law was given, and why God worked patiently with Israel for centuries. Faith does not wipe out the Old Testament. Rather, it makes God's dealings with the Jewish people understandable. In chapter 4, Paul will expand on this theme(see also 5:20,21;8:3,4;13:9,10; Galations 3:24-29; and 1 Timothy 1:8 for more on this concept).. I hope that I was able to help you understand this verse. I know that sometimes certain things in the Bible tend to be confusing, but you keep on studying and asking questions, you will understand a lot more. It also helps to read the verse from different versions. Some Bibles are easier to understand than others.

i believe it should just be the energy. like energy in mechanical terms is the joule [J], but when you devide this by the charge of an electron, you get the eV [electron-volt]. i think people use this unit for electrons and other small particles because answers in eV are not as extreme as they would be in J when talking about the small amounts of energy these particles have.  sorry if that's confusing

Two reasons: first of all, what you see in a photo is right-way-round, not a mirror image. You're so used to seeing your mirrored self that the other way looks wrong.. .

Haven't you read those Hello or Heat articles of "Stars on an off-day", famous actors and actresses looking terrible, eyes drooping, cheeks all jowly? Most people, even those most people consider beautiful, look below par in most photos: the trick of maintaining star status is to make sure only the good ones get printed :-)

well, spelling and grammar weren't only really standardized untill the early 1800's, I feel that this is just the next evolution in the english language, an optimization if you will. There are diff types of english, look at the difference  between a novel, peotry, and a letter to a freind. I think that having a form that is easy to write for non-verbal social comunication is a good thing.

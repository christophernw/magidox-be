I haven't read any of the other answers, so I don't know what kind of advice you have been given.  But I want you to know this - God didn't take your friend.  It was not His will that your friend should die like that - believe me, He loves your friend and is weeping with you.  The fact that such a tragedy happened doesn't mean He is powerless or cruel, it simply means that sin has consequences.  I know that I have felt the consequence of my own sin, we all have; sometimes it is tragic, like your friend's death.. . Your friend was living from her own brokenness, she was trying to fill the void in her heart - just like I do, just like you do.  God's desire is that we be reconciled to Him through His Son Jesus Christ, and live according to His will.  It is totally natural for you to have doubts during such a hard time.  But God will not allow your tears to be wasted.  Just as he weeps over the loss of your friend, he weeps with you and stands ready to comfort you when you are ready to return to Him.  He loves you more than you've ever known.

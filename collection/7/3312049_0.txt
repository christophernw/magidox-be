Fairies actually WERE real, the people that inspired the Fairy archetype were the "Tuatha De Daannan" of ireland and scotland, a very fierce population that didnt like outside contact and hid a lot, they had this particular "height" (they were short) and they were called by outsiders "The Fairy People"... then a lot of misticism was constucted around them, because they were thoght to fly and so other things, they worshipped the goddess dana, there comes their name.. . About mermaids, dont know.

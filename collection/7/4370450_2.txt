before rthe revolution it was bleu with golden lys flowers, the red is for revolution I guess the white takes its origin to the royal sytem before revolution as well. the colors are divided into 3 equal parts on static display like a book and 30% blue 33%white and 37% red on flags to allow them to be seen equaly while flying in the wind.

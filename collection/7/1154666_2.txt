First of all, it's a solar eclipse (not a lunar eclipse) when the Moon covers the Sun.. . Second of all, the Moon isn't always the same size as the Sun (as seen from the Earth) and it's not always lined up exactly. If it's not lined up it's called a "Partial Eclipse". If the Moon is smaller than the Sun, it's called an "Annular Eclipse". If it's lined up AND the Moon is larger than the Sun, it's called a "Total Eclipse of the Sun". . I saw one in the United States when I was 16. Now I am VERY old. lol

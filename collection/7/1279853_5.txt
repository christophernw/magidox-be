we've all been ther ;) . . if you're using internet explorer, at the top of the screen hit "tools" => "internet options" then under the "general" tab click the button "clear history". . if you're in firefox hit "tools" => "options" then under the privacy tab click "clear browsing history now" button.. . good luck

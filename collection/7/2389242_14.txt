Hmmm...because the cops are tired of sweeping people up off the side of the road with a broom, and blotter paper? LOL. . Basically, law enforcement wants people to try and be safe...you may feel all brave and heroic, but physics doesn't play. You can bend the road rules, but the laws of physics will slap you down like a little bitch if you cross Mother Nature...that highway may look innocent, but look down out the window or off your bike sometime when you're doing about 70....that's a concrete/asphalt BELT SANDER, and washing you off the road isn't anyone's idea of a good time...ride/drive smart, or stay off the road...you'll live longer...

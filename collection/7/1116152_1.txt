This may sound absurd but whenever you are talking, debating, arguing or having any type of conversation with anyone and you find your self wanting to curse, just picture yourself having that face-to-face conversation with your mom or dad.  Would you dare to curse or verbally abuse your parents (unless you don't get along with them, in which case, use God as the person you would be talking to). Would you dare use profanity in His presence?  The only reason people curse is for effect or for attention. You gotta remember that words said in anger or haste cannot be taken back. Besides, people who use that type of language usually have no class. LOL

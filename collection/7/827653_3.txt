Fried-brain sandwich. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Fried-brain sandwiches generally feature sliced calves' brains on sliced bread. Thinly sliced fried slabs on white toast became a ubiquitous menu item in St. Louis, Missouri, after the rise of the city's stockyards in the late 1880s, although demand there has so dwindled that only a handful of eateries still offer them. But they remain popular in the Ohio River valley, where they are served heavily battered on hamburger buns.. . The rise of incidents of BSE or "Mad Cow" disease in recent years will likely further diminish the remaining appeal of this curious regional dish. Brains from cows over 30 months old at slaughter are no longer permitted in human food in the US (Hefling, 2004).. . to each is own.....yuckkkkkkkkkk

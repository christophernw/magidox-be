My question precisely... in other words... why make things more complicated than they are and therefore harder to understand? Surely an almighty being would have known how to explain his devices to ancient humans simply. Surely if they could handle talking snakes, they could handle a little science lesson.  . . Why would God be so cryptic, knowing that years down the road, people would be led away from him by it? Why say that the earth was created before the stars, when in fact, the stars are older than the earth?. . This is a great site. . . http://www.generationterrorists.com/quotes/genesis_revisited.html

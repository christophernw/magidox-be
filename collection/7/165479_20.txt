A "redneck" is a neck that is sun burned. But you might be a redneck for asking this. You might be a redneck, if you mow your yard and find the car. You might be a redneck, if you take your beer to a job interview. You might be a redneck if you like redneck jokes. There are many more. Does this explain the difference?

Well Americans tend to talk about anything and everything, often too loudly or too boldly.  The British are a bit more polite and reserved.  I thought that they seemed more classy than us when I visited there.  But I was trying to be positive about my time there, maybe it is snobbiness instead.  I don't really know.

Well since the economy is so far behind on how much we make it would help the lower to middle class people with bills. I use to fill my car up with $10 when the minimum wage was $5.15 now it takes $20 plus dollars for same amount of gas at still of minimum wage of $5.15 thats $10 dollars worth of food I could have bought for the week multiply that by 52 weeks times 9 years since minimum wage has been same and that equals to $4,680. So its all mathmatics.

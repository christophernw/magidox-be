Two words :God and Country  There is this post -Viet Nam  feeling in America that the reason the war was lost was because Americans helped defeat  other Americans.  The Americans that allegedly  [and possibly unknowingly] aided and abeted the enemy were called liberals.  The fact that a lot of them were northerners and were destined for white collar jobs  was not lost on the working men of america. The anger is still very much there and the republican party has done  a great job keeping the rift open.. Most of the Republicans in power never worked a hard day in their lives. They never built cars  all day. Never swung a hammer all day, never drove a rig all night. Never had to make the decision of whether to pay the rent or the medical insurance.. So here we have the working class heroes of america voting for the college boys they hated in the sixties because they feel that the Repuplican college boys are more moral and will defend America better.

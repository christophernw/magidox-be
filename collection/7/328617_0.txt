The condition is called Hypohydrosis and there is help. I've been using DRYSOL for years and I could'nt live without it.His doctor can prescribe it and best of all, it's easy to use.Before he goes to sleep he dabs the liquid on his hands.Do this for 3-5 days and it lasts for a month and a half.With my health insurance it cost $25, otherwise it's something like $60 and it lasts a while.This stuff is gold to me.

Foil is shiny on only one side because as it passes through the final foil mill, two thicknesses of foil are rolled together. The sides facing each other emerge with the dull finish, while the sides in contact with the foil mills come out shinier â€“ due to the burnishing effect of the rollers. . http://www.aluminum.org/Content/NavigationMenu/The_Industry/-Foil/Foil.htm

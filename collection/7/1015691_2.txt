There's no answer to such a question, just like there's no answer to why are you alive.  In the first place, maybe you know you're gay, or maybe you're just going through a period of confusion, which happens to a lot of young people (I have no idea how old you are, but I'm guessing you're young).  The point is not "why" but how you are going to live your life.  I beg you, for your own good, don't focus on "why"!

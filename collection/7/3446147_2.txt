It seems to me that it would mean that Jesus is like that morning star that shines in the dark just before the daylight comes.  That is to say, he is that lonely light, that when people saw it, the "daylight" then came in all its glory.  In other words, if you turn to Jesus, God comes and gives full salvation.

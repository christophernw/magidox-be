Why? - Daddy's unfinished business.. . Also....someone had to be 'got' for 9/11. You couldn't find Bin Laden so someone else had to pay. The Saudi's (who were clearly responsible) couldn't be attacked because they were America's "friends" so the next easiest target was Iraq.. . The Reason/Pretence - WMD !!!. . The downside: You'll be there forever (think VietNam). . The Upside: Free oil.. . The legacy: No one trusts Americans and countries like N.Korea and Iran now have to develop nuclear weapons to protect themselves from American agression.. . Have a nice day.

Try catnip first and see if she will play after having some nip. Some will some are not affected by cat nip at all.. Some only like to play at certain times like in the mosring or late at night. . Some are just sort of lazy and do not really ever play much.. Mine likes paperwads far better than any of the toys I have bought. She will steal them from the waste basket and fetch those but not the toys or balls. . Cats have a mind of thier own.

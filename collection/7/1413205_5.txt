hey you answerer's (those who already answered).. does this mean you all have studied for your finals? really? no i guess not. its because you already know or almost know the lessons there. not every subject needs to be reread and relearned all over. that is why you have been studying for the past days, its halfly for the finals and you should have been ready for it. . . so it is not slacking or anything, its just taking it easy so that no pressure would be pressuring you when the exam comes. So when the exam comes, you wont be forgetting things you have already learned.. . nice one. i sometimes dont study too but I read too for the finals.

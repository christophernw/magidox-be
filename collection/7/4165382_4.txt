There is nothing wrong with asking a question of someone about their beliefs.   Not everyone is intolerant of others beliefs.  I'm not.  I ask questions out of curiosity.  Each person has the right to his or her opinions and belief.   If you don't like the answers you get, re-phase your question or don't ask them.

Who you calling "fat", lard-o?. Sure, high caloric food, little required labor, and a sedentary lifestyle are combining to create record numbers of lard-butted folk, not just here, but in England, China, and all of the emerging nations.. It is the in-bred human desire to become fat. We have spent most of our 200,000 years on the planet scraping a living from the land, trying to get just enough to eat.. Now that we are finally in a position to have as much food as we want, there's no real inherent mechanism to tell us "that's enough." We eat what is there because in our genes is the heritage of starving.. So we have to be aware of this and make allowances - cook less, cook smart, join a gym, play a sport - because if left to our own devices (heh), we'll be sitting on the couch, trying to find the remote in the rolls of our arm-fat.

A little late to get in shape there, buddy. If they're tomorrow then you should absolutely rest tomorrow and have a really good breakfast and see if you can sleep in a little late tomorrow and get to sleep really fast tonight. Tomorrow you're gonna have to go at it simply with what you've already got but once you get in you'll get in great shape with weightraining, running and a little food help. But as for now it's not looking so great if you were planning getting in shape overnight.

Imagine two big grounds , wherein one ground a big crowd gathered to hear the speach of a politician. Here each person will be moving randomly.And in the second ground same number of military men assembled for parade and standing and moving in a specified pattern.. If two men run through the two fields to the other side of the field, only the man running through the military men can easily reach the other end.This is because they are arranged in a certain pattern.. In the same way, ice cubes are traslucent because ice cubes are crystals and in crystals molicules are arranged in a definite pattern, hence it allows the light to enter and a few of light to pass through it.When this cube crushed, most of the light is reflected back, hence it appears white.

Twenty years ago people wouldn't even speak about gays.  Today there are Gay Pride Parades and nobody throws rocks at them.  It takes time for people to learn and accept.  It's a big job eliminating ignorance.  Give it time and nobody will act differently towards anyone.  Meanwhile .... . Peace and health

your religion some one that is very influential could start their own religion. . you are also right that point of life is to get closer to the creator.  If you are asking how do I know he exists I would ask you where did we all come from? A soup? Fine, where did the soup come from? Space? Ok, where did all the stuff in space come from? The big bang? All right, where did the matter for the big bang come from? The point is as far back as you go there is always a question of where did it come from and since we all know something dose not come from nothing it must come from something that always existed IE the Creator. . . most relgions today were started by one infuential speeker that claimed he saw the Lord. Then he passed on that to other people who trusted him and thus a relgion is born. . . that leaves you with three options . . Trust one of these people. . Find a relgion that was not started like the above (I have can you). . Regect all relgion and choose to trust in G-d or not

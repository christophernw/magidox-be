well, my dog iz 3, and hez kinda fat.  wat i do iz i give him 1 cup of food 4 breakfast, 1 for lunch, and 1 for dinner.  i take him out 2 run for 20 min allmost every day. u can buy healthy food at the store.  Take him 4 more walks, or runs often, 15-20 min per day. dont let him eat for 5 min!!!!  let him take hiz time.  when u take hiz food away from him, thatz abuse. i hoped i helped a little.

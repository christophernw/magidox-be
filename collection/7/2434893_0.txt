I'm not sure when this started being a feature in iTunes, so I don't know if this is on your version. I am in iTunes 7.0.2.16.. . When you connect your iPod, a screen comes up that is a pretty picture of the iPod along with tabs like: Summary, Music, Podcasts, etc.. . Click on the Music tab and there is a check-box for "Display album artwork on your iPod".  Make sure that is checked and then sync your iPod again.  It may take a while to sync because it's going to go through every track and upload the artwork for it, but should be fine after this one time.

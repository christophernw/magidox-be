Commander is who commands the aircraft and his word is final.  . Air Force pilots are not authorised to fly commercial flights as longs as they do not hold commercial pilot licence.  They are flying military aircrfts such as fighter planes.  There are many Air Force pilots who fly passenger aircrafts of the military.  .

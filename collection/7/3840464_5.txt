There are two motions at work here.. . 1 - Rotation.  The earth spins, and at about the same time every day, we are facing about the same direction we did yesterday.  So little changes from day to day, at the same time each day.. . 2 - Revolution.  The earth revolves around the sun, so what you see at the same time each day changes a little bit each day.  But each year, the stars will return to the place they were exactly one year ago.. . Knowing where the stars are, along with the day of the year, can help you determine how far north and south you are.  Couple with the time, and you can determine how far east or west.

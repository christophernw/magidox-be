One of two-. 1. The Battle of Thermapolae where 300 Spartans held 5 million Persians so the Greeks could rally their forces and survive. Had they not Western civilization in its Hllenic infancy would have been aborted and Persian dominated.. or. 2. The fight between Genghis Khan and his brother. Forgetting Genghis's MASSIVE influence on the world of the 13th century from Japan to Europe his progeny went on to spawn one thirteenth of the world (genetically proven) so if he had've lost that first fight for supremecy we might be short a whole half billion (one thirteenth) people in the world today. . Wierd huh.. And to all you who say Gettysburg, there's alot more to the world than JUST America!

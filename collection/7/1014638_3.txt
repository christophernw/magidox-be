A little late with this question. Math on the Brain takes time to develop. Many people depend on Calculators, which deminish the thought capabilities. Brain just like a muscle, use it or lose it. You have to Develop an excitment for solving numbers in your head. Just like exercising muscles, the Brain will actually need to work, it will want to think Math. I use a pencil and Scratch pad, as I work the problem I can write down Key Numbers. If I make a mistake it is easy to go back to the last correct Key Number. Not have to start all over again like with a calculator. Take this simple Addition to learn a Concept; 136+942=1078 I added this in my head as I wrote it out, when I typed the = sign I already had the Answer. We are taught to add from Right to Left. BUT, learn to add from left to right!!! You have to learn this on your own, schools not teach it much, maybe some do. Many numbers will work easy in your Brain if you teach it. Mutiply 112x46=5,152  Here I break down the numbers in my head and again the answer is ALMOST as fast as my addition; 100x46=4,600 10x46=460 2x46=92  4,600+460+92=5,152 Left to Right the Addition takes place simultaneous with the Mutiply part. NOW, taking the test; Work ALL the easy Problems first before your Brain Dead, then go back and work the harder ones, this quickly gets problems solved that you can do easy without losing time on a Hard one you may get wrong anyway. Lot to say, try to make it good in a short space. Apply what the others say too, lot of good advise here! Good Luck!!!

The human body has a natural system of electricity. The heart works through electricity. (That's how an Automated External Defibrillator works to restart a failing heartbeat.) When electricity is applied to the human body from outside, it may interrupt the bodies natural electrical rhythm and cause the heart to stop functioning properly. It may also cause severe burns through the skin.

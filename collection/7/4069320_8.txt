Yes, absolutely. . Rational thought and logic make life an interesting thing.  I enjoy being able to ask questions and finding answers myself.. But your context is wrong.  Atheism is not a religion that you "follow".  I simply do not think of it at all.  Like breathing. It is a logical thought process based on observation, it is not a way of life.. Yes, it would be nice to think that there was a higher meaning to life and the world in general, but it would also be nice to win the lottery at will.  My life is extremely happy and satisfying.  Full of love, giving, health, accomplishment, and fulfillment.  Being an athiest does not negate "miracles" as such, just gives them a different context.  The birth of my daughter was an amazing beautiful experience, whether I believe it is devine or not.  The experience is still the same.. And as a bonus, I dont go through life thinking the vast majority of humanity is doomed to an eternal hell.  Alot less hate in the world, when you do not believe you are right and everyone else is wrong.  I also take responsibility for my own actions and sins without blaming a higher entity. A personal responsibility that has nothing to do with reward and punishment.  Be a good person for the sake of being a good person and helping fellow humans.  Not because I am lectured to and threatened.. So yes, I am very Happy today.. . But of course you are entitled to believe what you want as well.

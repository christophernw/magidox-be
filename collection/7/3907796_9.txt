Evolution has nothing to do with "belief"... I never say that I believe in evolution... I say that I accept it. . . So, you can refuse to accept it, but that's about it. As for how you can not accept it... you can listen to bad science on sites like Answers in Genesis and not check your facts when you do so. Happens all the time, unfortunately.

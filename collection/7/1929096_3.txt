First of all, the internet is global.  Drug policy is not.  Saliva D is illegal where I come from, so the policy Yahoo exacts is in the interest of the majority, as well as their own indemnity.  Secondly, please don't seek advice regarding the use of potentially lethal substances (I know sage isn't one of these, but GHB, for example, can really f*ck you up, really easily) from the internet.  The information is unreliable at the best of times, especially when you consider your individual health condition.  I have irreversibly given myself manic depression and anxiety problems through mild drug use, due to a family predisposition to these conditions that I did not know about.  And I was lucky, compared to some people I know (some of whom, are dead).  I'm sorry, I don't mean to preach, you have asked a reasonable question - the battle of prior drug education vs. post drug punishment - and this is a debate that is still fervently in motion.  But you need to understand, that despite YOUR experience, drugs are dangerous and this will mean different consequences for different people.  So it is rather obvious why Yahoo removes such questions - they can't take any chances.  My advice would be to talk to a doctor, a regular user, a recreational user and a drug specialist.  This, in tandem with your own experience, will comprise a well-founded source for drug information.  Go from there.

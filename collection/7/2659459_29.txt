Global problems require local solutions. If there is no company or governmental agency in Mumbai that handles recycling, you may be able to take some sort of local action. Get together with your neighbors and ask them how they would feel about getting some community recycling project together. It might also help to find out if any waste management companies, or local dumps, have provisions for recycled materials.. . You may also want to do research on other cities in India (e.g. New Dehli) to see if they have any recycling or other environmental programs in place, and what they do. This would be the most practical way to begin, and you will hopefully find contacts who will understand your local concerns.. . Just about everything is recyclable: newspaper and other untreated paper, bottle glass, steel, polyurethane and polyethylene plastic, aluminum. Organic material can be used to make compost. . . In the U.S. and Europe, many product containers show special symbols that indicate how they can be recycled. Some products are harder to recycle because they contain toxic materials. . . I expect that there are resources in India that will help you. Good luck.

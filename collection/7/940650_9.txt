Both are theories that don't have answers for everything.. . Evolution seeks to understand scientifically how life and the universe came to be.  What it cannot explain, it simply does not have an answer for...yet.. . Various religions attempt to explain the unexplainable through faith.  If it was a "miracle", then God did it.. . Personally, I find the arguments for evolution much more persuasive...and useful.

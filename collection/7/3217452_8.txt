Some do and some don't. The more traditional ones believe that if you wear makeup or earrings, you are liken to Jezebel (bible), which in their eyes was a wicked, seductive woman. The church I attended, was Pentecostal, but we were taught better, so we knew that makeup had very little to do with your chareacter. We also wore pants. Which other traditonal Pentecostal think is wrong, because 'woman should not wear men's garment'.

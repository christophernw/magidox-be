If the pill takes 20 minutes after swallowing to work, and then you need to get to the right place, and then you need to run and freshen up, and then you need some make-out time, yada yada yada... be GLAD the pill works for at least an hour! Otherwise you'd have to be an experienced stunt artist to time the whole scenario down to an exact three minutes.

everyone in my entire family are nurses (except for me) and they all swear by clog-like shoes. especially birkenstocks. i guess they are really good for those who stand a lot throughout the day. dad suffers from some pretty bad foot problems from nursing, and clog like shoes with strong arches have relieved his pains.

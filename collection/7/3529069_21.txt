More than imaginable, very, completely, we all are, unthinkably too much, beyond belief, unforgivable amount.... But I am forgiven. Thank God for His mercy.. . I am so sinful that even if no one else existed, Jesus would still have to (and lovingly would) die on the cross for me! Me! I am unworthy. I entered this world sinful; we all did. He loves us that much to DIE for us. A KING! Isn't that amazing. I am not worthy to have a king die for me, I am too dirty. Yet He did it, He did it for me.

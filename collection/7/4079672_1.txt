HPV is a sexually transmitted virus that can cause warts, an invisible infection only found on pap smear, or, in the worst case scenario, it can cause cervical cancer.  It is important for a woman to have pap smears every year and to keep the number of sexual partners to a minimum to reduce the risk of getting a dangerous strain of the virus.  Men obviously contract the virus too, but they can not be easily diagnosed if they do not have visible warts.  Condoms can reduce transmission, but are not perfect because the virus infects nearby skin too, not just the penus and vagina.

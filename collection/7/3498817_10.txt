mmmmmm   tough one , calls for tact. How about saying to your boss "Hey smelly ahhh , I mean boss" or "Hey boss why dont we take a nice hot bath together sometime ?"or "I just got a new bathtub ,would you like to try it out?"or "Hey boss you can put hot water in the bathtub you know"or "Boss is your bathtub out of order ??"  Yes tactful comments along those lines should work quite well !!

Depends on your school. Usually an A is four points, a B is three points, and C is two points and a D is one point. And then you find your average. Depending on what school you go to, some classes may be worth more than others, and you have to figure out how to factor that in. My school has this systen where an A- is 3.5 points and a B+ is 3.25 points, stuff like that. And pass/fail classes may not get factored in or they may. It all depends on your school.

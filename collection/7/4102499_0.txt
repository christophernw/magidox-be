CAUCASIAN RACE. (From Wikipedia) . . The term Caucasian race is used to refer to people whose ancestry can be traced back to Europe, North Africa, West Asia, South Asia and parts of Central Asia.. . In the United States, it is currently used primarily as a distinction loosely based on skin color alone for a group commonly referred to as Whites, as defined by the American government and Census Bureau.. . In Britain, "Caucasian" follows the North American definition, but in continental Europe, "Caucasian" currently refers exclusively to people who are from the Caucasus.. . However, it is rare and becoming increasingly politically incorrect in Britain to categorise people as Caucasian because of the vagueness of its definition. Many South Asians in Britain could be categorised as Caucasian as well. For this reason 'White-European' is preferred for categorising white people as it is more specific.

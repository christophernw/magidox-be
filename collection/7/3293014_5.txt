I don't follow '-isms' or '-anity's'. That's the beauty of being free, you do whatever the hell you want, as long as it's not illegal. The bible thumpers and deep-thought philosophers keep trying to scheme out ways they're going to run the world, 'the world would be more better IF' this or that. Too bad they can't all just shut UP for a week, a month, a year, a millenium, or three. I'd like to see science and reason at the forefront, personally, I think those people have their act together. We turn ignorant kids out of our schools that can't read a map, use a computer, add 2 and 2 in their heads. These are kind of important skills.  By 'we', to qualify, I mean 'parents, neighbors, and schools'. Do that long enough, and you wreck your society's future, and it's been that way for decades, and now India tutors our kids, and china produces our software engineers. . . How about no bullshit-ism? I'd go to THAT church! LOLOL

Why just Chinese, what about other Asians?  My only guess is that it's a cultural thing, like why do people swing their arms when walking or slurp their food.  Perhaps it's because we are used to wearing sandals and slippers which tends to cause your feet to slide when walking.  Or perhaps many of us have flat feet and that somehow affects the walk.

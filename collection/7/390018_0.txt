Wow, the mere fact you're willing to learn to play chess to get close to the "nerdy guys" you like would definitely impress them. And It would be way better if you let them teach you the basics of chess. I myself play a lot of chess, and nothing beats a cool chick sitting in front of you asking what's the next best move.. (^^,)

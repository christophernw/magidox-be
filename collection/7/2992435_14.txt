It is spelled Ouija but you have the pronouncement correct.  It is a board that is used to contact ghosts and/or demons.  The board has all letters to the alphabet, numbers, yes, no and goodbye.  There is a piece, usually pie shaped, although I have known juice glasses to be used.  In the middle of the piece there is often a clear plastic round place.  People sit around the board and lightly place their finger or fingers on the pie shaped piece and ask a question.  When contact with a spirit or demon is made, the piece begins to move and answers the question.. . Ouija boards are nothing to play with.  I've seen them in action and my friend and I had an experience with one when we were very young.  We were so frightened when it moved by itself that we trashed it.. . Ouija boards are occultic and very dangerous.  My advice, don't try to contact the spirit world.  You may get more than you bargain for.

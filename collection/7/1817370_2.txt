It is possible to have referred pain.  It is also possible to still feel some discomfort in the RCT site as well.  Sometimes it takes more than 3 months for the discomfort to go away.  . . You stated that you have gone back to the endodontist and also had a second opinion.  Obviously, the RCT was successful.  I wouldn't worry about it too much.  Take some ibuprofen for the pain.  This is also an anti-inflammatory to help reduce any inflammation caused by the trauma of RCT.

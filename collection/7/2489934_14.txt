that's a good question. i was watching X3 when ice man and pyro were battling eachother. this very question was going through my head. i think that fire would over come ice (even though in the movie ice man won). i think fire has a greater impact. but then again ice and a forceful pressure can be the same. but i think fire would over-rule.

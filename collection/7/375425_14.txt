The ONLY way to salvation and forgiveness is through Christ, not through a priest, or cardinal, or the pope, or anything like that.  Though the Catholic Church tells us that we have to confess our sins to the priest, IT IS ALL LIES! They are only human.  Jesus will save you, and you don't need to do any work to get to heaven, aside from trusting in Him.  John 14:6 says, " Jesus saith unto him,  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." God Bless you.

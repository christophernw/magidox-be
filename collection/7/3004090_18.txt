Adam and eve is just a story that would make sence to the early catholics, and it teaches a lesson, which makes it a popular story. For example, would you like a different version that goes like this."Once man evolved from the filthy and unruly neandrathals, they discovered that loseing a loved one hurt, they then started careing about one another and as luck would have it, they formed a bond with other neandrathals. Then they started to share stories from the past, and as their brain started working through experience, they came up with a way to keep each other acting civilized, they called this entity GOD. And then they would threaten others that if they wouldnt act civilized that they would go to the worst place possible when they died, and since fire was still relatively new and misunderstood, and the combination of early man falling into gapeing holes and left there to die,( for there was not rope yet) they came up with a story invented, called Hell. And through the ages there were more things added to this story and people began to spread the word as some are more easily brainwashed due to their miserable lives. Then some others would change words in the story and create different religions, and as mans intelligience grew, created so many different exciting stories that soon there was a story for every part of life you could possibly dream up, and here we are today, useing religion to accomlish any task, good or bad for ones goals. Ironic isnt it?

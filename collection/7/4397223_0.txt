Well, don't pop the sucker, unless you like blood and itching and  possible (probable) infection.. . Try the following.... . Take 1 Tablespoon (heaping) of either Crisco shortening or Hydrocortisone Ointment/Cream, mix in 1 Teaspoon of powdered Alum (available in grocery store spice section). . . Mix it as thoroughly as possible and then  apply like an ointment to the "affected area". . . (NOTE: YES, it will feel kinda slimey!). . If you apply a healthy amount before bed, the "hemorrhoid" will be significantly reduced by morning. Reapply as needed.. . Unfortunately, once you have one of these delightful things, they are very tough to completely eliminate. Avoid prolonged "sitting" if you know what I mean, but don't force anything out either. . . OK, I will now move to a topic which is more pleasant...lol!. . Good Luck!

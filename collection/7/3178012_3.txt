Nupakry is right some communities use this to dry up after urination.. Scientifically & Historically it was used in the deserts where water was scarce and infections were an issue with the hot weather. So people cleaned up after peeing. As to why this is still followed today totally baffles me now??? Probably an issue again of mixing a totally logical procedure with religion!

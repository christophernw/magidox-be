I understand that many young people think that they should have free rein to wear whatever they like on campus but am glad that our local university has set very specific limits on what it will and won't tolerate.  It had to.  We had young ladies coming into class in men's pajama bottoms, flip-flops, and babydoll pajama tops.  Then again, maybe I should just turn a blind eye and keep my conservatively well-dressed opinion to myself at least until I get all those letters of recommendation from my professors that those other young ladies won't be getting because they chose to make a bad impression.

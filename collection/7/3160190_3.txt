handling a telephone interview is kinda risky but here are my tips to lighten it up,. 1. Relax. (if your relax you can hear clearly what the person is asking for and also you can answer it right if your relax.... a presence of mind will follow if a person is relax enough.... breath and think of positive things. think that they are also human eating same things as you ate... okay ). 2. Be Professional. (Remember all the things that youve learned from school, the phone ethics, the use of sir and madam and the voice modulation, speak as whats on your mind and go straight to the point). There were no diffcult questions, its a question and it deserves an answer and any answer is considered correct according to how it is delivered.

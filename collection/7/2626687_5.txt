Hi,. it isn't too hard can your bunny jump up on the bed???. If he/she is toilet trained then it will automatically go there rather than using your bed sheets.... My first rabbit used to jump up in the night to keep warm in the sheets, if you reward your rabbit with either loving jestures or treats then it may learn that the bed is a good thing, but unfortunately theres no way of keeping it on the bed once you've fallen to sleep.... Hope this has been of some help....

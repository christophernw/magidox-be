I don't know the specifics, but...is the living situation temporary?  if so, just work on moving things along I guess.  Failing that, if you're not ready to talk to these people about it (which is VERY understandable; it sounds like this is kind of new to you?), do you have any personal space in your home?  I share a VERY small apartment with two other people, but we all have our bedrooms to ourselves when we want "alone-time" for any reason.  It's not great, and it's not how things should be, but it might be better than nothing.

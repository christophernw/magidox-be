nope. this is generally what alcoholics get after they begin to drink constantly. It could develop into an ulcer if he continues to drink alcohol. he needs to stop for a bit, and for a bit I dont mean 2 days. so either deal with it or stop drinking for a while and then if he continues, drink in moderation and always after eating some food.

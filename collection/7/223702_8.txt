I struggled with worry all my life. ( I prayed a lot as well and I think God answered my Ernest prayers) . . I was (and still am to a much lesser degree) extremely concerned about lack - poverty - of not being able to support myself.  . . Because of worry I became very successful in my field and accumulated enough funds that I no longer have to work.  . . But I worried until I became ill - high blood pressure and an enlarged heart. . . Only in the last two years have I been able to gradually stop worrying.. . I did so, by noting all the positive things in my life and having a loving relationship with my family.

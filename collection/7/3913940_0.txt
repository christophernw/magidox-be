The transmitting antenna is often a tall vertical mast that broadcasts (casts abroad!) electromagnetic airwaves of an assigned frequency.  The wave length must be the transmitted wavelength or a rational multiple of it for best efficiency.  The "signal" is also grounded so that the wave is referenced to the ground.  Anything that picks up the signal can detect a wave variance (electrical potential variation) if likewise grounded.  Most radios use the groundwire of the house mani circuits to establish the reference.  TV antenna on rooftops must also have a groundwire to conduct lightning strike safely to ground rather than through the TV which is also grounded through the house circuits. . . For best reception, the receiving antenna should be similar to the transmitter antenna (vertical if vertical and of the same length or a rational multible such as full wave, half-wave, quarter-wave, etc.) and is sized for convenience, efficiency and usually to receive more than one frequency when equipment is properly adjusted (tuned to the incoming frequency).  Therefore Radio antennas are often long and cellphone antennas (very short wave) are quite short).  Vehicles with radio antennas often reach dead spots and must move to a better reception area and even align their antenna and vehicle with the transmitter antenna to improve reception.  Two-way radios (walkie-talkies) are not grounded and have limited ranges, but usually operate better if both are held with antennas parallel rather than one vertical and the other horizontal.

An interesting question, although one that some people might find offensive. I believe some of the personality characteristics may be the same as the characteristics of a socially inept or geeky person, or others of low self-esteem.. I believe they may be fairly self-conscious, sensitive to what other people say about or to them. Very loyal to good friends. They may seem egotistical if they ever accomplish something, but this is because of their desire to achieve 'something' in this life. . I have a lot of empathy for these people, and they have faults and positive characteristics, just like anyone else, but your question has merit, because their characteristics can sometimes be shown differently than other people.

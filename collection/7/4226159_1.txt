For several different reasons.... . 1. You can lay steel and pore cement while building the road on the bridge so that it can be strong and sustain the weights. Cement is more concrete than Tar and so can hold steel better than Tar. Tar is less expensive than Cement and thats why cement is selectively.. . 2. In extreme hot temperatures...even though it's not quite obvious to see...Tar do get heated up and expand a little.

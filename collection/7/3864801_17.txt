I did this once because I was visiting a male friend's house, and it made sense to me to leave it up, because that's how I found it.  But then, another girl used the bathroom right after me, and came out and asked if I was secretly a dude because I'd left the seat up.  So that's why I don't do it.  . . But why can't you just take a look and lift up the seat?

Why does it matter?  Caterpillars aren't the ones laying the eggs anyway!  It's the butterflys, the butterflys!  If you really want to know, go to the zoo or something.  Don't ask a bunch of people who don't have lives and just sit in front of the computer asking and answering questions!. . Oh, by the way, while I'm at it, swallows eat caterpillars!  Ha!  Go swallows!  Both African and European!

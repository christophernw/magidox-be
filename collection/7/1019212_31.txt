I have a larger chest (DD)...I also have a very small frame..so I hate it.  People stare..My boss stares.  Shirts look funny, no tanks that are braless.  Always having to wear a bra. Yuck!  I would much rather be a nice B-C cup. Plus the back pain and after having kids and breast feeding...can we say SUPER WONDER BRA....

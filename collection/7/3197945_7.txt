I have to say that for those who live in Europe, it is much more common, and indeed nessecary to know bits and pieces of other languages.. In America however, one can speak only English one's whole life and not have the slightest problem.  So that's the reason for the ignorance of other cultures and language - not arrogance, Americans just aren't used to it.

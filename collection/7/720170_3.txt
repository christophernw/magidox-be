Are there any Christian governments???  Other than Vatican City (a sovereign nation), I don't know of any governments that are Christian.  I don't think the Vatican is a terrorist government.  If you are unknowingly referring to the US, here's something you need to know.  The US has a secular government whose laws initially were based on the Magna Carta (a European document) whose roots were Judeo/Christian.  But that's as far as the Christianity goes.  The US is governed by the rule of law, which will be in place and will be followed even if an atheist (infidel) is elected.  The people in our government come from all faiths, not just Christian.. . Please don't blame a religion for the assumed bad behavior of its followers.  If you did that, you could easily claim that all Muslim governments were terrorists.  . . If any of the world's governments were truly ruled according to the purest form of a world religion, I doubt that any would be terrorist or war-like in nature.  All of the major religions of the world have goodness at their roots and in their tenets.  Did you know that all of the major religions have some form of "the golden rule" in their teachings?  (Do to others as you want them to do to you.)  It's the PEOPLE that mis-interpret the religious beliefs and go astray.. . The one idea from Christianity that I really love and appreciate dearly, is that of "love one another". . . Anyhow, look at the teachings. You won't find terrorism as a directive in Christianity.  Next time, educate yourself on the issue before you make any wild erronious claims.

Don't speed on any public roadway, go to your local racetrack....Here in Northern CA we have Sacramento Dragstrip we can go to.. you gotta pay & be insured cause the track assumes no responsibility for you or your vehicle.....then the only points ya' gotta worry about are race point's & you can still legally drive home..I drive a tow-truck for work & have seen how speed kills, SAVE your own life and slow down on AMERICA'S roadway's..........Good Luck, God Bless & be Safe

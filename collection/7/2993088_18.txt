Most animals aren't smart enough, nor do they have nearly the amount of emotional intensity, to commit suicide. Life is much more simple for them. They eat, sleep, poop, and thats it. I've heard they can get depressed, but not so much that the thought pops into their little brains of, "Hey, I should go run in front of a car now so I can end my miserable life!" Humans are smart enough to both enjoy life more and, in that case, not enjoy it at all.

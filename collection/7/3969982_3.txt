I'm sure it's obvious...their compensating because they're losers...thereby making them more of a loser when people figure out they lie all the time. And just in case anyone wonders...I really was in the NAVY. Nuclear Machinist Mate 2nd class. E5. Worked on steam pipe and valves for the nuclear reactor. I just wanted to clear that up in case anyone read my profile and thought I was lying about it too.

Some plastic domes are used to enable the camera to move to point to a target. I have seen some cameras that are used outdoors that have a wide range of movement. I donÂ´t think is your case. Fixed cameras are mounted in big metal boxes. The small ones can be happily fitted in domes like the one you are talking about. In any case avoid eye contact for your own safety.

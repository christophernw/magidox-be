Of course you mean Pensacola FL ,  the Cradle of Naval Aviation, Worlds whitest beaches etc.  I agree w/ Shell.  If your company's leadership gives him enough rope, he will eventually hang his self.  Do not drop to his level. They will certainly notice the change in you and likely do something about it before it spreads.  Maintain your higher ground and your customers will appreciate you for it. They are the ones who actually sign your check.

If you find the answer to this question I would sure like to know. I have tried all the suggestions I have found on the net so far. Tinfoil under the tree worked for about an hour, now he plays with it. Spray in him with water used to work when he scratched the furniture back with the tree he gets soaked and still won't get out. Haven't tried the orange peels yet but I am about to peel an orange and try it. Good Luck!

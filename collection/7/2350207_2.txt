Thank you i totally agree.I don't have anything against any race either. i mean, think about it. the other day the mexicans took the day off to show the country what it would be like without immigrants, but thats stupid! we should have all taken the day off because all of america is immigrants and if you want to live here, please live here leagaly! i dont blame them for wanting a better life over here, and i agree that our goverment isnt perfect with the immigration issue but my ancestors had to work their butts off trying to get into this country, and they should too.

This is what I did when I was a kid: I wrote up a huge, formal-sounding proposal outlining every single aspect of why you should get a dog, realistically how you will take care of him, and also list all of your responsible attributes and how you think this will make you EVEN MORE responsible. Just make them an offer they can't refuse...if you cover every base and truly know you will take care of a dog, then hopefully they will trust you and see your point of view. My parents thought my proposal was hilarious, but it also worked.

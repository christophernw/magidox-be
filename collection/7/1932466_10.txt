You don't seem to understand the issue.. . Devout Catholics are not concerned about "The Da Vinci Code" damaging their church, or forcing educated catholics to question their faith.. . The danger is with Christians who are "on the fence" as far as their faith goes; the ones who would like to believe and even become Catholic, but are then lead away from the Faith by a slanderous piece of fiction.. . That is the real threat and the real concern of devout Catholics. They aren't worried about a work of fiction bringing down their church. It won't cause them to question their faith. In true selfless Christian form, they are concerned about the those who desire to know God, but because of their lesser degree of devotion to God, and lack of knowledge about the True Catholic Church, some might be lead astray and, potentially, not be saved.. . Wouldn't you say that was legit cause for concern?

The distance across the top of the wings is longer than the distance across the bottom of the wings creating a more negative pressure on the top of the wings or a more positive pressure on the bottom of the wings( refer to is the glass half full or half empty) once the positive pressure on the bottom of the wings exceeds the gravitational pull on the aircraft you then have sufficient lift to take the plane in the air and this would be minimum take off speed and also the reason we need long runways. Hope this helps.

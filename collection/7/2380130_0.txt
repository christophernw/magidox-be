If your boss had counseled you on this issue in the past then, yes he can fire you for this offense.  If this is the first time he has spoken with you about it, I would definitely contact a lawyer.  However, you should always excuse yourself from a room, especially a professional setting, if you even think you would be emitting any kind of bodily noise.  My friend's husband thinks it's ok to pass gas where ever he is and it's not ok, it's completely rude and inconsiderate.

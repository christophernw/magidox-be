After an action potential is fired, there is a refractory period. During the refractory period, no amount of stimulation can induce another action potential to be fired and it also prevents AP's from moving in the opposite direction.. . Hyperpolarization also occurs after an action potential is generated, which also prevents the AP from going in the backwards direction. Once hyperpolarized, no amount of stimulation can cause another action potential in the cell.

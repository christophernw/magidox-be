i ve heard a story about heart. maybe that wud give u an idea.. when god first created adam and his spirit entered his body. the first place that came alive was his heart. and thats where he first feeled all kind of emotions n feelings. it has nothing to do with science.. . also your heartbeats increase and gets strong when u feel strong emotions like love, excitement, fear. so instictly human beings maybe making connections between heart and feelings.

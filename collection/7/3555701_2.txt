Clearly the Republican party is (at least presently). Their talking head, G.W., entered office by criminal means! He was then re-elected. This should be proof enough that Republicans have no problem with crime and are therefore more lenient to criminals.. . Also, George W. Bush has continued to break law after law after law since taking, and then retaking office. And I do mean "taking". He stole his presidency, and that is why he will never be my president.. . I left the Navy in 2003, after a successful and productive extended first tour, because I could not look myself in the mirror any longer knowing that I was serving a criminal's political ends! To those who say Bush's opposition don't support the troops, I say this: I AM a troop, and I HATE Bush. Figure that one out!. . Don't settle for "representative democracy", folks. It is not democracy. G.W. lost the popular election and still became president! Why even vote then?

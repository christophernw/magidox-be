We are all spiritual persons, however some need to belong to organizations and to be read to from a book of rules and regulations, they feel more confident with a set of rules. Spiritual people are not looking for books we are looking for knowledge within and without ourselves. We are open to the greater universe and the marvelous workings of nature, we don't need to sit in a building to worship our creator.

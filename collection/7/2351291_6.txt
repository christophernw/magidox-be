My available balance is usually less then my current balance. The reason being , the bank has been notified that a withdrawal is emminent within a few days. Therefore, a certain amount is kept in waiting, making the available balance available for you to use, but the rest is not.   But, according to you, it is the other way around, so I have no idea what that means.

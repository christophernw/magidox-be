liberals try to silence conservatives because they are scared of the populace waking up to the fraud they are. . . ever notice how when you're debating a liberal and you back them into a corner with facts, they do one of three things.. . 1. say the word "strawman" and keep repeating it.. . 2. get angry and call you names and hurl personal insults.. . 3. sidestep the argument and start with a completely off topic debate. . . what do these three things have in common??  they are all an attempt to shut you up.  why else do you think they've been going nuts since fox news aired??  all in all, liberals want to be the only ones with a voice. the fact that they aren't is what angers them. . . that's why polictical correctness exists. to silence all opposition to the left and control what people can and cannot say, or even think.

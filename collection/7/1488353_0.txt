a relay is basically a sort of switch which you can on or off using a considerably small vol.the strip containing the phase(signal to be swithed) is touching some point and directly below that point there is another point(connector).so when an ON pulse is given a coil joined to strip gets magnetized and strip touches the connector point.this way using a small vol. pulse you can control any large vol. signal.

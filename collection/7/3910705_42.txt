When you jump out of an airplane for skydiving the plane is flying level to the earth. If you needed to jump out of a normal flight, chances are the plane is plunging towards the Earth. As you jump out of a plunging plane (or any commercial jet) you would be sucked into the engines and the people in Denver don't want to feel human rain. Unless, do you like being sucked into the engines and shredded to bits?

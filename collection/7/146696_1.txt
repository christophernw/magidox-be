When guinea pigs are scared, they usually hide anywhere they can; a hutch, the corner of their cage, or behind another animal. Loud noises and sudden movements are a sure way to frighten them. If they are scared they will run around the cage, kicking bedding anywhere and not let you pick them up.  Another indication that they're scared is that they will go to the bathroom everywhere.. When they are happy, their actions are usually the opposite; they will lie in the middle of their cage all streached out. Sometimes they will shy away from your hand, but if you go slow, they will usually let you pick them up.

Lock picking is not always successful.  There are a lot of kinds of lock picks, but most people prefer a raker pick.  You just slide the raker pick in and out repeatedly and hope you can get all the pins in the right position.  You also need a tension wrench, which is just a little metal thing used to turn the cylinder like turning a key.

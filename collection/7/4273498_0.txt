Depends wht is the occassion for d greeting....if it is miscellaneous, then I'd say, paint a couple of flowers...or u could do a little bit of thread painting of a white sheet of paper. On that , use some nice pen or paint for writing some nice thoughts in some nice font. Or you can take some paper cuttings and stick them on a peice of paper to make it like a collage. I think you would like that!

None of those you suggested will work.. . We have to be firm and stay there until the kids (the iraqi government) have decided to stop throwing their toys.. . The Iraqi need to establish a government and quick. . . Saying we should pull out the troops is dumb and not very informed. If we pulled them out Iraq would spiral out of control and be worse than it was with Saddam Hussein, he may have been a dictator and not very just. But he brought some order. Even if it was oppressive.. . People need to stop talking about how we shouldn't have gone to war with Iraq. We've done it now, lets forget about that and think about resolving Iraq. Once we've done that it'll be a much better place than before we went to war.. . The war was inevitable, it needed to be done. As a powerful nation who has the ability to help these countries, thats a responsibility that needs to be fulfilled.

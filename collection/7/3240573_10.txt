is this her first babies?? if so then sometimes this is normal for a first time mother like humans cats have to learn how to take care of thier babies....This may sound bad but you got to do it...Ok first of all make sure she is not sick.. then take the kitten place them gently on her tits and let her feel the feeling of them sucking her she will start to feel motherhood... and will take care of them.. If she still is not wanting to take care of them chances are the kitten themselves are sick and you just dont knwo it or she is just being lazy and you will have to feed them with a dripper untill they get to eating soft cat food..Which is usually around 2-3 weeks...

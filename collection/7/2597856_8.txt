It works!  You have to have faith that God has heard your prayer.  He already knows before you ask, that's the cool thing about it.  I would never stop praying for a loved one.  As a Christian, it's what we are supposed to do, is pray for those who are lost.  No, he wont force somone to come to him.  Your peace is knowing that God will do it in his time, not ours.  Though, someitmes it is heartwrenching to watch someone and think that they are never going to be saved.  It hurts too, but just be patient and God will work wonders.

First, one theory says that the BERING strait, a piece of land connecting russia and alaska, which was above sea level during the last ice age, was a route the first inhabitants took to reach the americas.  A new theory suggests that they may in fact have come by boat, from islands like hawaii and others south of Asia (though that would have been a long trip!).  People have NOT been here since the continents split, however, since HUMANS DID NOT EVOLVE UNTIL LONG AFTER THAT TIME!

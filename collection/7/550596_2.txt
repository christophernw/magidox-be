Plating Metals requires a process known as Electroplating...powder coating i believe is just a metallic finish which is sprayed on an adhesive.  Electroplating requires the desired object to be placed in an ionic solution with the desired plate metal...When current is enduced to the anode and cathode, the metal slowly dissolves and replates on the object

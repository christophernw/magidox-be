In addition to what georgsama said, I would like to add that when doctors speak of 'pleural' pneumonia, that is an infection of the pleural linings. Supposed to be quite painful, trying to breathe. So it is 'pleural', not 'plural'. There is no such thing as 'double' pneumonia, but the words sound the same so that is where people made the mistake.

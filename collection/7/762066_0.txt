i HAVEbeen a Jew for a long long time and have never met a Jew who was ashamed of our heritage.  I don't know why you think so but you must know some quirky Jews.  My mother-in-law was somewhat strange, I remember my husband and I were going to a Cleveland Brown football game and she begged me to put my Star of David under my shirt so as not to make waves.  I didn't do ashe said and nothing happened, of course.  Some Jews, MAYBE fear another Holacause especially when you get monsters like the head of Iran which calls for the destruction of Israel and the murder of all the infidel Jews.

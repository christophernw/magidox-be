We  humans are animals but we have some extras that differentiate us from other animals. We have the ability to reason and to weigh complex variables in order to select the alternative that is consistent with our desired outcome.  We also have a soul and spirit that permits us to develop a relationship with our creator and to plot a course of soul development that makes us a closer representation of God who made us in his/her image.

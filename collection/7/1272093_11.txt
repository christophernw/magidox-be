Steam it for 20 minutes, pull each leaf off, dip it in butter, and scrape off the soft part with your teeth.  When you get toward the middle, you can just bite the base of the leaves off.  . Once all the leaves are gone, scrape the fuzzies off the top cup shape, dip the stem & heart in butter and enjoy one lovely bite at a time.  . . Man, that sounds good.

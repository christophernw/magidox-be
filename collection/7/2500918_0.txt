Calalmine lotion is good for a mild case.  There are also over the counter hydrocortisone creams that will help with the itch and redness and for a really, really bad case (I hope for your sake not) like with blisters you can get some prescription steroid anti-inflammatory medicine from your doctor.  Don't scratch!

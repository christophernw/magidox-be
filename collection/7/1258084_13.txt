Being born human is enough.  Every person is born with the capacity to sin and the inability to stop.  If heaven is the presence of a Holy God and sin cannot enter his presnce without him no longer being holy, then every human is destined to hell from birth as a result of the "bad" in their life.  There is absolutly no amount of good works that you can do to account for your sin nature.  The only way to overcome this discrepency and free yourself from sin is through faith in Christ, God's son and his redeeming gift to mankind.

Your hemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen in your blood and delivers it to the tissues. It is made of 4 proteins two called alpha and two called beta, and a molecule of Iron that keeps it all bound together and is responsible for catching the oxygen. In alpha thalasemia the alpha chains are damaged or not produced due to a genetic factor and then hemoglobin is unstable and tends to break the red blood cells and impairing the supply of oxygen to the tissues.

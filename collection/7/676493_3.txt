Hey you have to watch them old ladies they're crafty. Ok, cops storm my house, a drug bust is usually done on kitty cat feet and then all hell breaks loose. Zoom in on granny, she's doing exaclty what so that she can get her hands on a weapon and shoot 3 officers. What is she an exmarine? I'd likely peed myself right off, and the weapons aren't beside my knitting, don't see the need to be locked and loaded while watching soaps.. Even with a mistaken identity the general public doesn't come out blasting. Mistaken identity, I think not either, the old crone is as guilty as sin.

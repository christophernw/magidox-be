Don't put them on the floor. Rabbits are always going to be semi-wild animals and never train completely. You got the animal into the habit of going in one spot, so they'll continue to do so.. . My suggestion, go back to the litter box. You got the animal, and you have to accept the responsibilities, no matter how disgusting, and take care of it.

A serious answer:  if you would actually read the story, the "fruit" in question is the knowledge of what is good and what is evil.  The temptation was to reject God's wisdom and to seek one's own moral standards, or as the serpent said, "to become as gods yourselves."  The idea is that only God truly knows how to tell good from evil.  Their disobedience represent a deliberate break in the human relationship with the divine.  The problem is that people are so literal with scripture that they trivialize the story into a cruel game.

Liberalism is about bringing the largest amount of freedom to the largest group of people possible.  Conservatism is about minimizing the impact of government (in its idealized form).  The '70s were liberal because the children and young adults of the '60s became the adults of the '70s and carried forward the liberalism of the 60's.

Warm air, with all its molecules moving around more quickly, is less dense than cold air, and can hold more moisture. There's a lot of moisture inside your car from your breath, so  when that air hits the cold windshield, the moisture condenses out. That's why turning on the cold, but very dry, A/C makes the fog go away, and why you don't get it when it's hot out, unless it's really, really humid...like in a rainstorm.

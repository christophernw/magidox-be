I can answer that one for you!!! When 9/11 occurred, I lived in France. Everybody was ready to help you in your battle against the fucking SOB that did that. But then Mr. Bush (who has very little diplomatic tact, as the rest of the world knows but americans seem to be oblivious to this fact) decided that he would use this world backing to serve other purposes (namely the War in Iraq which is actually not officialy a war). But the world was not dupe and when the US went their anyway, the rest of the world was very mad that America, the peace-keeper was disrupting world peace for unproved reasons. Then America decided to call the nations that chose not to follow them into what is now known as the suicide-warm unpatriotic (anti-frenchness being very strong in 2003).. That is why the world hates you. Sorry.

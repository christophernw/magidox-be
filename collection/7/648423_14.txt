What miracles??? Did he do any? Is putting yourself in a barrel with handcuffs a miracle? Is being run over by a car a miracle?. Same as David Blaine... ice cage, aquarium cage, plastic cage over london, buried alive. All they can do... well, what people think they can do is levitating, the rest is all, "I'm about to perform a very very dangerous stunt, and it is very possible that I might die.... but don't pay attention to me, please do not think that my actions and this television show are to get your attention.". Hate them both. ¬¬

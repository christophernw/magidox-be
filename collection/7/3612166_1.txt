pet lover has the most correct answer, with my first cichlid I was baffled by his tank arrangement so I put the gravel and rocks back but low and behold, the next day, it was all messed up again...Its a cichlid thing..   also that one guy was very right about introducing a new fish, re arrange the tank, It forces your convict to find and create a new territory for him self. Make sure your tank is big like min 25 gal for a second fish..   one more thing when hes about 2.5 inches or so you can feed him live worms, wash them first and make sure they ar not too big, your ciclid will be nervous the first time but he will eventually grow to LOVE them.

Ok, without any further information, I'll make some base assumptions:. . 1.  The definition of "cold", in "cold water" would have to be something less than ambient room temperature but not as low as freezing point or the question would have read "frozen water" or "ice".. 2.  Likewise, the defintion of "hot", in "hot water", would be greater than ambient room temperature but not so high as boiling point or the question would have read "Boiling Water".. . Now, since the scale known as Celsius is defined by two points - one being water freezing (zero degrees Celsius) and the other being water boiling (100 degrees Celsius), we can begin.. . First, let's find the standard called "ambient room temperature".  Now, I know that the ideal room temperature value in Farenheit according to ASHRAE (Heating and Air Conditioing national standards) is 65 degrees Farenheit.  Let's convert to Celsius:. . C =  x*(100/(212-32)). C =  65*0.5555. C =  36 = Ambient Room Temperature. . Therefore, . *  "cold water" would be any temperature that is less than 36 degrees C and greater than 0 degrees C.. likewise,. *  "hot water" would be any temperature that is greater than 36 degrees C and less than 100 degrees C.. . Any questions?. .

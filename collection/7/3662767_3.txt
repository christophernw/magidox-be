Take out the spark plugs and use a shop vac on the holes there to pull the water out.  Then leave those holes open for a few days so that any water still in the motor can evaporate through them.  Also change the air filter to a new dry one.  Then change the motor oil and the oil filter.  Do not start it until these are done or else it will kill your motor.

Well as I'm sure you know, the little hairs in your nose filter out the dirt and bad stuff in the air you breath. So those so called "Boogers" you used to eat are really dried up (or slimey lol) clumps of dirt and other things that aren't good for you. I suggest you do not eat them. Nor your children if you have any. You or them could possibly get sick from the bacteria.

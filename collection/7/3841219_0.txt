it's  not easy at all  , but it's possible , when you feel hurt , and your heart is full of sadness , the best thing to do is trying to forgive , when you forgive others you will feel better .. think positively , try to look at the other bright side , think about others sadness , if you lose a brother , other one losed a whole family , if your hand is cut , others may have the 4 limbs cut ... cry , when you cry you will realize that you are better than millions of stone-hearted people ... . . good luck

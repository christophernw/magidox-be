Founder is a secondary condition of Laminitis.Laminitis happens when the sensitive Laminie in a horse's hoof become inflamed.This can happen for a variety of reasons.The most common is to much rich food,or food high in sugar,such as spring grass.. Founder is when the laminie are no longer supportive of the coffin bone and connective tissues and the coffin bone rotates and sinks down .In severe case the bone will come through the hoof bottom.Founder is a preventable disease for the most part.Horses at risk are ponies as they tend to be insulin resistant,overweight or obese horses and those who have foundered in the past have a greater chance of re foundering.. You can also do a search for it through yahoo or google.Hope this helps

she is our monarch (figurehead these days) and the only person higher than her is god (did you know that the only person you cant sue or get the police on is the queen, even if she murdered someone!!)  It does seem silly doesnt it, I always thought it was a dreary song, land of hope and glory is much more energetic isnt it. She is the head of the church and colonel in chief or the armed forces, she has to give permission for a prime minister to enter office, i doubt that she would excercise this right to refuse though, basically she owns us!!!

The best way to get crispy french frys is after you slice them up you bake them on low in your oven turning them over once during the baking. They will turn a lite brown and feel dry on each side. remove from oven and after a few minutes you can deep fry them until crispy. The reason potatoes become limp while frying is that the grease explodes the water inside the potatoe and becomes traped inside where the water once was. Drying the outside and evaporating the water prevents this. Goodluck and enjoy.

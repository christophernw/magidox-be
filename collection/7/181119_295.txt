Pizza Delivery, Camp Counselor, or at an Amusement Park.. . I delivered pizzas for a few summers and it was a lot of fun. Of course, you have to be at least 18, have a driver's license, insurance (don't tell them you deliver pizzas!), and be willing to beat the crap out of your car.  But if you meet those qualifications, it's cash in your pocket every night and a never-ending list of parties to attend.. . Have a Rockin' Summer!

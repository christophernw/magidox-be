you will need:. -some plastic film. -a bowl. -some tape. -a peice of old fruit. . make a cone with the plastic film but leave a small gap at the tip. The base of the cone should be big enough so that it can rest on the edges of the bowl and leave enough space underneath for the fruit.. keep the cone together with the tape.. put the fruit in the bowl. put the cone in the bowl pointy bit down. . leave outside in the summer.. . the flies will be attracted to the scent of the rotting fruit. . as long as the gap at the point of the cone is big enough ,they will go in to the bowl throught the gap. This is the only way for them to go, and the path to the fruit is shown to them by the slope of the cone towards the fruit.. If the gap is just the right size (i.e. not too small and not too big), they will have trouble getting out of the trap because they wont be able to find the gap very easily. so there should be some flies in there if you leave it long enough. be careful of wasps getting trapped though.

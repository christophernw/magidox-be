flour will work as previously suggested but cornstarch works better or you can use a styptic pencil (sold in the personal care section near the men's razors) a styptic pencil will work when few other things will but it is liable to sting your pet for a few moments.  the other people are correct though, you should not cut nearly as short as you evidently have in the past.  I would recommend taking your pet to a vet or pet superstore and asking to watch or better yet be taught the proper way to trim your pet's nails

Ah,a conservative rant disguised as a question.Interesting.. . I've asked the EXACT SAME QUESTION about reactionary conservatives.. . Also,why this nationalism that the USA can do no wrong in foreign affairs,such as American servicemen  killing civilians?. . I think the facts of the Bush administration are ignored by his biggest cheerleaders.

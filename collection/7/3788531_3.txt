Alot of times that i have seen the questions are "attacking" another religion.I think if people attack another person on a level of religion then they arent comfortable about their own.Everyone has the freedom to believe whatever religion they want.Thats the great thing about the world today,and alot are very accepting.I see where your coming from tho..

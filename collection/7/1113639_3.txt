the word 'common' denotes at least two entities,here fractions.so,the issue is to find the common denominator for two or more fractions. The method is to divide the denominators by common devisors,retaining the indivisible as such and then multiply all the divisors and the indivisible entities.for example among four fractions having denominators as 7,6,21and 27,the method is:stepA2)7,6,21,27(:-7,3,21,27.Step2:- 3)7,3,21,27(:- 7,1,7,9 StepC:7)7,1,7.9(:- 1,1,1,9. Step D;-multiply divisors 2.3.7.and indivisibles1.1.1.9;u get 378.common denominator

yes, it is definitely very important to me because it helps me become closer to God and it helps me to ecnourage my fellow believers and to be a mature believer who can help them in their times of trial, but spiritual growth is not easy, it is hard and there are hard times of testing as well, but since Jesus is always with us, we always come shining more in God's love and grace out of our trials!!

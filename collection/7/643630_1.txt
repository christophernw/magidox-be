Unfortunately there's nothing you can do, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you that,but what you can do is remember none of it's your fault. Love both of your parents and keep a good relationship with both of them as long as you can and if they divorce be there for them, they are having a hard time too.Just because they can't get along with each other doesn't mean they don't still love you.

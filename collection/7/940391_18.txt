I have no idea.  I was pretty practical minded as a teenager.  Do not get me wrong we had our battle but it wasn't over boys, sex, dates, drugs, drinking.  It was more like skipping school and being late to classes and not doing my chores.  I thought the kids out doing drugs/drinking/spreading disease and popping out kids were retarded.  I just felt that I was making As in school without being there why bother...my father had a different opinion.  I WON!

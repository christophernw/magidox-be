Not knowing the circumstances and what exactly is happening? It is hard to give an opinion. You could have your house 'cleaned' which involves a ritual. If you are religious, speak to your church leader, if not you need to cleanse your house and anything that the evil person/s have touched. Evil is real and it can make you sick. Don't leave it too long to deal with. Cassandra Eason has a website and she is a very well know spiritualist. Contact her at www.cassandraeason.co.uk.com she is a world recognised person.

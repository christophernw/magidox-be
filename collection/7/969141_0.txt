to resolve conflict between or among others . if you are arguing with someone when you fight your goal maybe to hurt this person, to get even,or conflict resolution. which requires objectively reflecting on the issue and behaviors and reactions and perceptions that all parties involved could work on altering in the future as well as what is the root of the problem and how do we agrre to disagree or walk away or not take things personally or make ourselves aware that someone else is ignorant angry and looking for a good fight and remain superior to this person by refusing to give away our power to feel positive and not take this person seriosly for example you come up and call me the c**t word and something abouy how you are glad my mom is hurt I am not a wimp or afraid if I do not defend myself or attack back If I am at work I can state I will not tolerate your threatening tone or hostile behavior or disrespect which ever feels best you do not intimidate me and if you cant be civil I have to ignore you and you can calmly say this in front of people or try to talk away from others this has happened to me and of course the bully blew up in front of people and I kept walking going about my business and eventually called into the bosses office and was unlike many people who get involved in conflicts at work taken seriously and it was not a personality conflict where both people get reprimanded because I did not engage the other in an arguement and when I was called in I did not accuse this person of being unreasonable or difficult I just restated what I told this person earlier and recalled the blow up and stated I did what I said I would and ask what did I do wrong and what was the correct way for me to respond and how would he respond in my shoes and I was told next time tell my immediate supervisor that there is no problem but if conflict should arise I will not tolerate direspect and I will ignore the other person so in the future if you ever hear complaints about my unprofessional behavior you will know why, because witnesses said I was rude because I did not even acknowledge this person and the person blew up but someone else saw the first encounter I do not know how I did it maybe I had just gotten some that morning or slept well that night or just ate some candy to make me happy because this person was a notorious jerk that never got in trouble because everyone else cursed back and couldnt tell because they were guilty to inside my head I was screaming obscnities to this idiot and imaginig all the evil things I would not mind watching this person suffer through but I practiced conflict rresolution instead of following my desires

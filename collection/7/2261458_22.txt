I'm sorry for your loss. My cat died in 2003 and I didnt get a new cat until December of 2004. I just thought that he was special and it would be hard to replace him. When you are ready for a new bird, you will know. It's perfectly ok to wait a little bit or go right out and get one. everyone is different. For me, I had to wait. but that's just me.. Good luck

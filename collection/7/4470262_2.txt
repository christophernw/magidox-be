We can't make artificial water - but water can be created from it's two main elements: hydrogen (two parts) and oxygen (one part).. . And to the person making editorials to post #3 and post #4 ... Creating water out of hydrogen and oxygen is NOT making artificial water. It is creating the genuine article out of it's base elements. Thus far, there is no "artificial" water, at least in the same vein as synthetic oil or anything else man made.

I am from a small town in Texas and I see that stupid thing all the time.  Now, in my town most of the people who have the flags don't even realize what it means.  And the ones who do should be shipped away to a deserted island.  I am sorry for all of the people that live in the south like myself that still have to put up with "hillbilly" ignorance.

If you wear a tie when everyone else is wearing jeans you will just seem like a misfit. Instead of buying ties spend your money on much better quality casual clothes and take good care of them. Have your shirts laundered instead of wearing them wrinkled like your colleagues. Take your upscale jeans and khakis to the dry cleaner after you wear them a time or two. Wear nice shoes and keep them polished. You need to take a cue from how CEO's at Fortune 500 companies dress at casual events, instead of doing the retro tie thing.

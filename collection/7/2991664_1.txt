The terms are often used interchangeably.  I understand the terms as follows:  Bail is the amount the court holds to ensure someone appears in court.  It is returned after the trial.  Bond usually refers to an amount equal to 10% of the bail that is paid to a bondsman or the court acting as a bondsman to as a fee for posting bail.  This amount is not refundable.  My source is various TV shows and should be relied on to the same degree.

But by reducing the cost of the car to something that the masses could afford, a huge amount of demand was created in supply industries including mining, steel, rubber, and also road building--it was a lot of jobs, and all those people made money and spent it buying things and that employed lots of other people.  It was a huge boost to the middle class, the biggest market.

I don't think most rap music is about drugs, although there are a lot of rap songs that talk about it. It's pretty stereotypical to say that rap music is all about sex, drugs, and money, but lately, it does seem true. It's rare to find a rap song that doesn't include those three topics nowadays, unfortunately.

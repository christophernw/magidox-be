I live in Los Angeles...you have to get an actors union card to do this...when there is a casting call it will state what they are looking for and what you should wear. You show up and the casting director picks who appeals to them for different scenes. Sometimes they furnish the costumes. Lots of fun and good bucks...just not too steady. Usually, if you are a certain type they will call you when you are the right type. Sometimes you get very short notice to appear.

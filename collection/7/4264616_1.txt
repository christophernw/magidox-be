its a rare, yet unexplainable phenomenon where the victim's body bursts into flames spontaneously and is reduced to a pile of ashes and bone fragments. in most cases surrounding flammable items (newspapers usually) are untouched by the flames and show no signs of being touched by the heat. however the fire required to burn a human body in that manner would be so hot that it would probably torch the walls and burn holes in the ceiling and floor.

President Bush seems to me to be pretty decent human being trying to do the best he can in the job he has.  I am really really tired of all the Bush Bashing that goes on.  . . I think he is doing the best he can with the knowledge and experience that he has for every one of the millions of issues and problems he has to deal with in his job.

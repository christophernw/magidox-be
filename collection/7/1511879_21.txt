I agree with the answer early that mentioned the age...how old is your daughter?  In very young children, they are not able to accurately diagnose ADD or ADHD so they will put them through testing then say "ah, yea sure, here's your ritalin".  I won't even get my child tested, I just tell myself, I would rather have an over active child than a lazy one that sits on the couch watching tv all the time.  By the time they are in school, the teachers should be able to tell you if they truely think your child has ADHD or if they are just active children.  People want to label an active child ADHD then put them on ritalin and wonder why we have a nation full of lazy children.

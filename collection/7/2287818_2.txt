Jpshwitz; did a good job on a basic level. This does not mean that I think he is on a basic level, but rather just wanted to explain it basic manor and this is likely what you wanted. However I am going to take it a step farther. I think knowledge is power. . . An iris or aperture and an f-stop or not the same, an f-stop is a measurement of the amount of light that hits the film plan (or CCD).  An aperture or iris is a device that controls the amount of light. Therefore the f-stop is controlled by the aperture setting on your camera.. . The lens aperture diameter determines the deep of field (the area of acceptable focus in an image). The smaller the aperture size (the larger the number Ex: F22) the greater the deep of field. The larger the aperture size (the smaller the number Ex: F2.8) the lesser the deep of field. . . A 28mm lens (wide angle) set at F-8 will have a greater deep of field than a 100mm lens (telephoto) set at F-8, therefore it has become a common misconception (even by many professionals) that the length of a lens effects deep of field (length of lens effects perception, it compresses the image as lens gets longer). The truth is that it takes a larger aperture setting (more light coming through the lens) for the same amount of light to reach the film plane (CCD) on the longer lens.  Therefore F-8 on a 35mm lens is a smaller aperture than F-8 on the longer 100mm lens. Aperture size controls deep of field and F-Stop settings or lens length do not.. I suggest you get a good book (or search the net) on photography and how a camera works, knowledge will improve your images.. . .

When every you have a foreign object under your skin, you should have it checked out.  It may not be glass but you shouldn't take a chance.  Glass won't "fester" but could cause other problems.  My suggestion is to get to a doctor and have it checked.  Glass won't be broken down by the body and will stay the same.

when you shave your hairs the reason they come back darker and thicker is that, the part that wasn't cut will begin to grow and since it is already thick at the base it will grow up and look thicker than the previous hair. reason y it is longer i don't really remember but i heard that the more you shave the faster it grows back and longer it become.

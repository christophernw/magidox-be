Could be from too much rest.  I have heart related problems and I find that if I stretch my legs out BEFORE I get out of bed, then it doesn't hurt so much to walk.  Also, feel your legs and see if they are cold to the touch, this could cause cramping.  I use a heating pad for relief or a hot shower. Added later:  You may want to read up on DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis).  It could help clarify some issues in regards to your pain-especially if you have had any trauma (serious injuries) in the past 5 years.

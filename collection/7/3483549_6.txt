Its all part of the Big Gov Big Brother campaign of fear.  They, in the guise of the DVLA have no idea if you've paid your road tax or not.  So, worry ye not.  The only way the DVLA and their commandos the Fuzz, can find out if you've paid road tax or not, is to physically stop you driving your car in the street and check your disc.  I saw this happen a couple of days ago near where I live.  The notice at the police check-point read CENSUS.  What's that supposed to mean.  They also breathalysed a few people.  Me, I was just walking along sucking on a can of beer.  See if I care.

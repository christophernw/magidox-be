Is your skin reddish and warm to the touch? Does your skin also hurt when you touch it or bump it against something? You've also got to consider how long were you in the sun. Sometimes, your skin will start peeling after a couple days. I typically don't sunburn, but when my skin get shiny and starts to peel, I know I had sunburn.

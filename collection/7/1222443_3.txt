That very stereo-type comes right out of Mexican Cinema!  American culture isn't the only one perpetuating stereotypes!  I flip through the channels occasionally.  I love old movies.  So when I see a Mexican movie that looks old, I stop and watch... some have great musicals...  movie elements are similar in Mexican film as well as American film.  I have seen enough of these images in the Mexican movies notice that this stereotype you are complaining about runs deep in both cultures.

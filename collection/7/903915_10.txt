Firstly God isn't supposed to be perfect.  He is perfect!. He did create people perfect as well.  Remember he told the man not to touch the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.  Ok so you ask the question why then did he give him a choice?  Do you want to be a robot?  Do you want to live a life without the ability to make choices.  Or do want to live a life knowing God allows us to make decisions on our own.  The problem is we make the wrong ones.  He told the Man not too touch because the day he would he would die.  What does the idiot do he touches the fruit.. This is just like telling a child not to touch the fire because it will get burned.  Sadly the child probably will touch it and will learn the hard way. The really sad thing is people think man made the right choice.  Actually imagine what life would have been like if that fruit was never picked?

You would have to contact the bank. Unfortunately, because there have been many bank mergers in the past ten years, you may have to do some investigating just to find the bank that might have bought the original bank. However, if there has been no activity in 10 years, the account could have been closed and the funds transferred to the state unclaimed property fund. If that has happened, the documents you have would help you in claiming any funds.

are you serious, most women who get married adopt an adult. they look after the man, wash his clothes, iron them, feed him, take over his responsibilities, shop for him, clean his mess in the bathroom, organise his family functions, emotionally support him, put up with his tantrums, look after him when he is sick etc.etc.etc. is this not the same as adopting an adult.

all life is sacred. All life. Vegetarians just eat sacred life that cant run away. There is no difference between Killing a cow or killing a carrot. Every living thing is sacred. To say no to death is to say no to life. Everything that lives must consume life. Its a simple fact. Accept it. It doesn't really matter what you call it.

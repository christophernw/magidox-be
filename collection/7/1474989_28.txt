Never mind "God"! Go and create something wonderful in memory of your friend.Paint something, write something, sing something but create something for you and all your young friends.. In this lifetime "God" will do nothing for you and nothing when you are gone from here either. Live your life to create and leave something tangible that others can benefit from.. These zealots practise one thing and preach another.A week ago I was condemned to Hell by these "forgiving, tolerant dogmatic hypocrites.. No, get on with your life . Treat others as you would like them to treat you.. Be forgiving, be tolerant, be loving, be creative but please don't get bogged down with religious indoctrination.It's ruined an otherwise beautiful world.. Take your memory of your friend and cherish it.. Take good care.. . http://thebaldchemist.blogspot.com

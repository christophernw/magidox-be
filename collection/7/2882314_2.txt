when my son's FOB was bombed and they lost two guys I found out from my son 3 days later. The FRG said she was too upset to call. That was totally irresponsible. I don't have an answer for you other than hope they quit or transfer and someone takes their place or get to be good friends with the FRG so you can keep informed. it sucks!

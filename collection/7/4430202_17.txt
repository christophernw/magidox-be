I totally forgot today was Thanksgiving! I'm currently on a business trip and had to drive about 500 miles today to get ready for an appointment tomorrow. That's not the bad part, that's just a 'typical' day. The bad part was that I just made one stop for gas and didn't start looking for 'eats' until I got to 'here' (medium sized town); all that's open are the in-convenience stores. My t-day meal was Lay's and Frito's, the *only* veggie friendly food around here (Wally world is open but no grocery section here). . . Hmm; I suppose a 'fast' for T-day is wryly apropos for a veghead<giggle>.

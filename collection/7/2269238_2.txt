The thing is, Ken, that your theory still holds even if the symbiont theory is correct.  Bacteria probably have circular genomes simply because it is the most stable conformation for such a small amount of genetic material.  That does NOT conflict or even address the issue of how the mitochondria came to exist in the first place.

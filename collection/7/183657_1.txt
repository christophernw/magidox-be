Well, if you think about it dollars are just pieces of paper that have points assigned to it.  A dollar bill only has value because we accept that it does.  Or money used to be backed up by Gold (Something with real value), however, now it isn't backed up by anything.  So, your question shows how smart you are, because it took the U.S. hundreds of years to figure out what you were already thinking.

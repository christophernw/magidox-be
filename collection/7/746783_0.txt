I watch Saiyuki...There's Tripitakas (Sanzo),Sun Wukong-Monkey God(Goku), Pig(Hakkai) and Friar Sand or Sandy (Gojyo).They trvel to the West to get holy scripture called Sutras and are lead by Tripitakas...In Saiyuki they are known as "Sanzo Party". Sun Wukong is very mischevous...but he is the most powerful.On their jouney towrds the west, they encounter lots of obstacles like demons who want the scriptures..Thre's also the Dragon Prince who is known as Hakuryu in the anime, Saiyuki!The other villains include  The Iron Fan Princess and Bull Demon King. There's also an imitation of the Sun... Sun Wukong was born from a rock and Tripitakas is a monk...and Sandy is a river monster...

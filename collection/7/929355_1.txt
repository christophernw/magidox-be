Pay Pal is like having credit online, you have to give them a lot of info including your address and a credit card number to have on file for various purchases on E-bay.  You can also use it like Western Union...in other words you can send money to other people who have a paypal account, all online.  So if you get enrolled I can send you money in a matter of seconds.

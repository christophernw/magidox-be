I was born and raised in northern Indiana (close to Chicago) and my husband is from central Indiana. We both say exit, but pronounce many words differently. His parents say "warsh" not wash, "collar" not color, and "seement" not cement. Also the odd ball of calling a green pepper a mango!. . Although particular regions may say certain words and vowels distinctly, it also matters where your parents are from! My children spent the first few years of their lives in a foreign country and spoke English as a second language. Their dialect and pronunciation is different from everyone else in Indiana! When they speak the foreign language they also speak it in the local dialect of where we lived. . . In the end it is based on alot of factors!

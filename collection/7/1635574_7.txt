I used to have this problem. I fixed it by speaking slower and taking breaths. Whenever you feel like saying ah, just breath instead. Also, practice more. Say your speach in front of your family and friends. That way, you won't feel so much of the nerves that cause the ah's Eat a banana before giving your speach. That cuts down my nerves and my ah's too.

There used to be a kit that had complete instructions with it.  I know you need to have 2 bathrooms, as you start by placing this small litter box that is made to fit the toilet under the toilet seat to hold it in place, and that get's the cat used to the idea.   Plus that way they learn to straddle the seat and squat.   Check your local pet center to see if you can find this.

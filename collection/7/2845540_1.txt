It depends on the game - there's a small logo on the back of the case which says if game sharing is available or not.  If so, then it's just a case of starting it on one machine then connecting to it using the other, at which point the game is transferred over and you both can play.. . First party European titles Fired Up, Wipeout Pure and Need For Speed: Most Wanted 5:1:0 all have shipped with game sharing features. A few other titles have included this feature as well, such as Burnout Legends and Lemmings.

To become fat or obese you need to consume more calories than you burn.. . The number of calories you take in are a reflection on your diet. For instance protein and carbohydrates have less calories per the same weight in food compared to fat, it's therefore easier to eat more calories if you are eating fatty foods. . . The calories you burn are based on your muscle mass which is in part determined by your height and gender. This is your Basal Metabolic Rate. Of course you also can burn calories through exercise, but for most people excerise burn very few calories even with 1 hr of intense exercise.

Mostly by hard work and savings. Then when you have some money you can try real estate or get a good broker and buy some reasonable stock. I paid $5,000 for stock in AMLN a medical firm that had a new cancer drug and in 8 months collected $10,000. You could also investigate some home businesses which you can do part time which would bring additional income. - Good Luck!!

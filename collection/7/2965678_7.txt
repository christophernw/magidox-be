Originaly, I believe it meant simply someone who did not believe in God, or did not practice the locally accepted religious customs and dogmas. Now it refers to people who practice Earth or Nature oriented beliefs (such as Wiccans), people who believe in Majik, practice Witchcraft, etc.... . Paganism is a very fascinating set of beliefs; very openened and in many ways more logical and believable than the more "blind faith" oriented religions. It also has deeper roots and traditions in English and Celtic society than the Roman-originated Christianity

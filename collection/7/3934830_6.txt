I don't think that Christianity teaches that humans are the only animals with souls, just the only ones with souls created in the image and likeness of God.. . Further, I disagree with your implicit premise that a soul is material/physical. A soul must be something other, because men and random combinations of chemicals are not the same. This is manifest, because men have the ability to reason, the ability to move under their own power, and the ability to sense things. Because of this difference, and because we know that men and random combinations of chemicals are material, what separates them (i.e. the soul) must out of necessity NOT be material, because the cause of difference can NOT be the same as the reason of sameness.

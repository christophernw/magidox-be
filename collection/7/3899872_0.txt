Try one while they are cooking.  I have found that it takes about 10 minutes of boiling the noodles before considering if they are done or not. If you throw one at the wall and it sticks, its done!!!!! (joking)  One piece of advice, once the noodles are done, DO NOT rinse them, instead let them sit in a Colinder (strainer) that way the sauce will stick to the noodles better.

Physics are for measurements in a format of equations.. Physics allow the measurements to make sure that a theory or prediction is correct.. Like Cosmology stretches into the Astrophysics of space and Chemistry goes into Chemical physics and particle physics.. Physics make things and makes sure they are physical.. Physics are maths, a translation from Greek to make measurements.

welll this is very interesting....because how can u have a set number of expected friends...just be happy with the amount that you do have. Now if you feel left out what are you doing that would make someone exclude you. Are you bossy? Do you tend to gossip alot? Are you friends with people that others dont like because you are a product of the company you keep. Now for this whole boy thing how old are you? Well that doenst really matter...is there anyone that your interested in cause you dont want a boyfriend just for the sake of havin one cause you will be highly disapponted in the end. so narrow down the guys you like and find things that you have in common with them and use that to ur advantage.

People think its a profound light from the clouds moment.. . Im sorry to dissapoint you but it will never happen on words alone.. words alone do not teach.     When you seek you shall find.. . What the heck does that mean?   Well it doesent mean you read a book and the magic wand waves and you become "better"  or.. it doesent happen when someone slaps you on the forehead and makes you see again on tv.  Indeed.. . As a former Agnostic.. and before that  former wiccan AND BEFORE THAT christian  i switched alot of sides and it didnt click for me until I realised .. until I found I did it for myself?   . . Until it made me feel better to not feel stupid for not knowing the world or not knowing myself or not knowing other people.. . Until i read the bible and parts from many phillosophical, christian, gnostic, saints, and new age that essentially the simple truths that they have in common..  where  IN COMMON... . Its not working.. Because its not right for you.. . Spirituality in short means..   your relationship with yourself.. your spirit.. . You will find what works.  if you seek it.  No one else will ever be able to tell you what it is.   Dont pick a group thats wants you in it  to bolster its numbers    recruiters bring you in to use you.. and will fundamentally disrespect you for being yourself.. . you need to step back and laugh at anyone who will know better then you on how to run YOUR life.       find your spirituality.. with an open mind   and no exspecations  and anything that doesent exseed what you where hoping to find..  shouldent be paid any mind.. . . it should feel right  and MAKE SENCE and feel truthful.   and exsclude no one.. . god exscludes no one.  even the ones who to the most evil horrible things that turn thier backs on love.   Theres no source of evil  just how well we turn out backs on the truth of it all.

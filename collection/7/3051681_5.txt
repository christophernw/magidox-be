You need to schedule a time to study...seriously. For every hour of class time you should expect to set 2 - 3 times as much time aside to review your class. Start by reading the text-book there are always comprehensive questions at the end of the chapter, even if your teacher/prof did not assign it do them any way you will have a much better understanding of what you are doing. Really you have to be disciplined and commit yourself to setting the time aside and not allowing for distractions.

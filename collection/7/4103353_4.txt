He's giving them enough reasons to make it sound that way.What with him going on like a lunatic declaring their well rehearsed words for the press.. . You see it was all supposed to be just a publicity stunt,then Tom decided to take it to heart. Can't say i blame the guy though. She did promise to marry him.. . He's taking her rejection really badly.he needs to take time off, spend some time in a home for the mentally unstable, and accept the humiliation of yet another failed relationship.. . My only pity goes to the unborn child!

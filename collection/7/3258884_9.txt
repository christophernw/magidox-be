I would say the following, but Stephen Colbert (The Colbert Report - Comedy Central) already did in a Commencement address at Knox College in Illinois.. . Now, will saying "yes" get youin trouble at times?  Will saying "yes" lead you to do some foolish things?  Yes it will.  But don't be afraid to be a fool.  Remember, you cannot be both young and wise.  Young people who pretend to be wise to the ways of the world are mostly just cynics.. . Cynicism masquerades as wisdom, but it is the farthest thing from it.  Because cynics don't learn anything.  Because cynicism is a self-imposed blindness, a rejection of the world because we are afraid it will hurt us or disappoint us.. . Cynics always say no.  But saying "yes" begins things.  Saying "yes" is how things grow.  Saying "yes" leads to knowledge.  "Yes" is for young people.  So, for as long as you have the strength to, say "yes".

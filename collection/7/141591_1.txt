Have a budget.  Dump everything you don't need such as the Starbux cofee ($4*365= $1460), cable (that's like $600 a year right there), extra trips in the car ($40*52=$2080), top of the line clothes ect.  I think you could squeeze $2,000 a year with ease that way.  If it's real bad, think of working another job on the weekends ($8*16 hours *52 week =$6656). So now you could possibly have $8,000 a year extra this way.

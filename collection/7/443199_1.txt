They do have their ways. . Our pets know what we are saying most of the time. They do react to certain punishments. I have told my pet if he does not be good, he will go to the animal shelter. That makes him settle down and be kissing up. There are animals who seem to comunicate with me, however there is little doubt that God has the hand in the communications of animals.

What we do is cook the stuffing the night before thanksgiving.  Then we put it in the fridge to cool it down all night and then we put it into the bird so that both are the same temperature.  If you put something hot into something thats not the same temp that could be a big problem make you sick and stuff.. . Anyway, that way the stuffing is actually already cooked inside and you are just getting the flavor and benefits of the turkey... just make sure the turkey is good and cooked and you will be just fine!

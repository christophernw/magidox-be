the smoke is on everything... even in sponge that the seats are made of. Ur best bet is to not let smoke in Ur car and cover it up until it clears. oh and don't forget the headliner. it collects the smoke and keeps it locked in its own material this was the problem in my car, hopefully u wont have to replace it

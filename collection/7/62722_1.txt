Humans have a biological algorithm designed to identify dangerous and poisonous foods. Since eating things like garbage is unhealthy, we associate the look and smell of things that we are not supposed to eat (garbage) with unknown food in order to decrease the chances of eating bad food.. . If the food tastes good, I don't think the looks matter. This is because the taste tester knows that he/she is not eating poisonous food and that the black color is food coloring.

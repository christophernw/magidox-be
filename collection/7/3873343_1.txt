"Noone ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the average American.". . Their goal isn't so much to insult our intelligence as it is to side-step what intelligence we have by appealing to all manner of other human traits - subtly playing upon our insecurities, desires, hopes, dreams, etc.. . Their targets (those soft spots) are placed at the center of their effort, while whatever they have to tell us about the product itself is soft-pedalled, as when they provide some tasty image of how their product will enhance your life while mentioning as though in-passing the twelve or so things that using it (a pharmaceutical, for example) will do to your liver, heart, kidneys or lungs.. .

Once they'd broken-through an enemies' front-lines and into his rear areas, all resistance to their forces largely collapsed.

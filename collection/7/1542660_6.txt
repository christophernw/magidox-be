If your dog has taught himself to sleep on the bed turning it around will take a little longer. First never EVER let him on the bed anymore or you will confuse him, every time you see him tell him OFF, if he wont get off try a treat by throwing it on the grown and saying off. When he does get down praise him. Also get a dog bed or comfy blanket that he is aloud to lay on and encourage this. When you are unable to monitor him. Shut your door or try putting a chair on the bed. You can also put mouse traps on the bed (they have ones made for this purpose at pet stores) The noise will startle him off the bed, he will also learn going on the bed makes bad things happen even when u aren't there. Good Luck

Ecclesiastes 3:1-8. 1â€œTo every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:. 2 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;. 3 A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;. 4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;. 5 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;. 6 A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;. 7 A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;. 8 A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.". . For me this covers everything that happens in life. Everyting has a place and a time. Life is always as it should be. It may not be what we want right here, right now but it is as it should be.. This song is also one of my favorites.

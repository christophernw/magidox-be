I am a neat person except when it comes to my room!I am so bad about it that when I do decide to do it it takes forever!So trust me on this!Make a list!!!Write out unspecific things-like around bed-then do around your bed- make bed- under bed but everything you pick up has to go where it should be!If it isn't in reach,make piles(i always have a make-up pile, clothes pile, jewelry pile,GET RID OF PILE!ect.)The trick to not taking forever is playing music that gets you pumped rediculously loud.And get rid of things!Things that just lay around that you never use can go to good-will or other charities like that.So you get your room clean,listen to great music,and help others.Doesn't sound so bad huh?!

everyone feels different about how they look. Some people, yes, do have disorders..but saying its just caused by disorders isnt true. The image of a perfect girl is a model from Marc Jacobs, and we all know his models are 5'6 and 70 pounds. So, of course real skinny girls still feel they are fat, compared to those models. Dont judge them, they already judge themselves enough.

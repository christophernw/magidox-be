Depending on the engine, you probably cracked a head.  You can do a temperary fix if you put some silver seal in the radiator.  Do a compression test.  No, it won't tell you the condition of your rings and valves.  There is rarely damage to the rings or valves.  The rings and piston will scorch if you get it super hot, otherwise, you only comprimise the integrity of the head.  It may also have a warped head.  Is it aluminum?  If so, it's most likely warped.  If it's a 2.3 with a cast iron head (not the shiny one), then just pull the head, intake, and exhaust out together and check it thouroughly.  Look closely between the valves.  The clean combustion chamber will be the one that's sucking water.  Good luck.

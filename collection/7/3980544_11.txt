I have many Latino friends and acquaintances at work. Some are decent and respectful, but the majority of them seem to think it is their god given right to seduce as many women as possible before they die. This is an observation on my part from conversations I have heard. I hear the same thing from some African and caucasians but not nearly on so large a scale.

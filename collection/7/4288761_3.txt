The first thing I would like to say is I'm sorry for your loss.  Me and my wife almost lost our child at birth and it is hard to imagine what you have been through.  My heart goes out to you.. . I don't know what state you live in, but it sound like you are going to need an attorney.  I would think a court order would be the only way to stop him.  If you don't have the money, many attorneys will take on free cases when it's for a good cause.. . I don't want to take sides but you should talk to your ex-husband.  Everybody grieves in different ways, seeking retribution may be his way of putting things behind him.  You guys could possibly come to an agreement if the funds were turned over to a charity or another good cause.. . Good Luck. . Chamberlainjk

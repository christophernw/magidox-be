Do you know that God is there, listening? If so, one would think you'd be exited to "talk to Him" and get directions from Him. But, you might be less motivated to pray, if you are not sure that He is there. Have you prayed for Gods help in this?. . When I have a hard time praying, it is usually because of my own bad conscience, and/or because I have been to superficial and not honest enough in my prayers. I have no illusions of being able tide anything from God, but my prayers and answers to prayers are much more satisfactory when I have thought things through before I pray. It helps to know (and admit to yourself and God) what you are really praying about and it is a form of honesty. Then you might starting to look forward to praying. . . Are you ready for an answer to your prayers, even if the answer is not what you expected? Is your mind already made up, or are you ready to act on God's quiet whisper in your heart? If you aren't ready for answers to your prayers, chances are that you won't get any. Have faith and pray for answers and directions. Pray for Gods hand in your life and then, WHEN you get your answers--don't be slow to pray in grattitude, to give thanks and recognition. Let God know through your prayers that you realize where your blessings come from.

Not all cemetaries do but some do for this reason.. . The sun rises in the east, making it easier to read the head stones in the morning if they're facing east.. . The sun shines directly on the head stones in the evening that are facing west, as the sun sets, making THEM easier to read. Also having direct sunshine on them make them a little less gloomy. Even if it is only part of the day.. . It's just a little something special some cemetaries do.

Taj Mahal is a world famous monument located in Agra, in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. The origin of the name Taj Mahal is not certain. Court histories from Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan's reign call it the rauza (tomb and mosque complex) of Mumtaz Mahal. It is generally believed that Taj Mahal (literally translated as "Crown Palace" or "Crown of the Palace") is an abbreviated version of Mumtaz Mahal's name. Today, it is sometimes simply and evocatively referred to as - The Taj. The Taj Mahal, as of 1983, is an UNESCO World Heritage Site and a major tourist destination. The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. Over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials during the construction.. for more information visit the below site:. http://www.haryana-online.com/taj_mahal.htm

its important not only because many will become parents at some point but they will also deal with kids at some point or another. they need the knowledge to understand and know alll the milestones and what to look for. by looking i mean, if they are behind in growth, whats "normal" growth, and when its a cause for concern. students need to understand the full responsibility of being a parent. its not cheap or easy. it is getting used to another being, not putting yourself first. they need to take the course in child development for knowledge and understanding of children.

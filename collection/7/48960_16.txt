The Christian religion split between Catholics and Protestants because the C. Church at that time was corrupt. One major difference between the two will help you to understand their other differences. Protestants believe the Bible is infallible. Catholics believe the Church is infallible. Of course the Catholics gave us the Bible, or at least decided which books to include. Protestants believe Christ is the head of the church here on earth and Catholics believe the Pope is the head on earth.

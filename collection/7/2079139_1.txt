It's a prepaid mastercard - kind of like a bank account (although with exorbitantly high charges) that you can buy at Walgreen's or online. It has nothing to do with your credit score - just gives you a mastercard linked to an account that you fund with your money. No need to give your social security number or any other personal information. It's just for the convenience of a credit or debit card.

Its not necessarily the fact that your going faster that makes your car save gas. Its the fact that the engine is not having to work as hard to keep the car up to a certain speed. While you are in traffic you have to accelerate then slow down for stop light and other motorists. While you are on the highway and you are at a steady speed, the engine keeps one RPM so that in turn conserves gas.

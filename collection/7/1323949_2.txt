Ok- putting him in the bathtub or sink could have done it. Ever heard of soapscum? It is a residue of soap in the bath. Soap is poison for fish. If there was any residue in there, it could have killed your baby.. . Was your fish gulping at the surface at all? If he was then he didn't have enough oxygen in the water and drowned.. . The water change may have been too much of a shock. You should never change more then 1/3 of the water. It is bad for the fish. They are very delicate.. . Were there any spots or fuzzy stuff on him??? That would have been a parasite or a fungus. That can kill a fish very fast.. . Do youu drink your tap water? In some places the water has a lot of chlorine and minerals. You need to filter it or buy water conditioner.. . These are just some possibilties.. . Last of all-A goldfish should NEVER be kept in a bowl. These are the worst fish to live in a bowl. They produce more poop then anyother- this makes their water dirty really fast. They get very big- like 12". They are very delicate, they also should live 20-40 years.. . If you want a bowl get a betta.

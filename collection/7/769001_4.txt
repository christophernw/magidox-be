put together a solution of water and vinegar and flush his ears with it.  But are you sure it's not ear mites.  My yorkie had the black stuff and I couldn't get rid of it.  I also did not think it was mites but finally took him to the vet and sure enough it was.  put him on ear drops for a week and hasn't had any problems since.

sounds like she wants to play with you.  My chiuawa does the same thing we have tried changing foods and every thing.  The best food so far is benefiuls from Purina.  He seems to make a dent in it when we are not looking However he loves to play with his food.  They are suppose to grow out of this stage but he will be 2 in sept and still does it.  You might even try canned foods.  Good luck!

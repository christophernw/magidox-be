I learned that not all Americans approve of the policies of the Bush administration. Many believe the invasion of Iraq was illegal and was the result of the administration lying to the American people.. I did not realize this before I came to Y!A, and I respect those people for their courage in speaking out.. . I found a kind man in England who agreed to read and critique my latest novel. He has given me some very helpful feedback.. . I'm corresponding with a man in New York who sends me all sorts of video links for my entertainment.

Depending on the severity, see your doctor.  If it can be controlled with OTC medicine (like excedrin), then keep a supply of that with you at all times.  If it can't be controlled, visit your doctor to ensure that it is a migraine (not a tension headache, cluster headache, or other more serious problem) and to get a migraine specific medicine and possibly painkillers and anti-nausea meds.  . . If you have moderate to severe migraines, be particularly careful about self-medicating with other remedies.  Treating with caffeine can create severe bouncebacks that can be worse than the original headache and some herbs can stimulate migraines - especialy if you are sensitive to them.  Moderate to severe migraines would be intense pain (typically localized on one side of the head); severe sensitivity to light, sound, and touch; possibly a loss of vision (called an aura); nausea; possibly a loss of sensation; and possibly confusion.  . . Sleep, ice packs, and dark, quiet rooms (no reading, no TV) can help alleviate the symptoms of a migraine wonderfully, so try that as well.  But unfortunately for some people, the headache may linger for several days unless it's treated and stopped.

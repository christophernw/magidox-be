I recommend selling online through autotrader (www.autotrader.co.uk) It's quick and easy and they have a fab support team. Just email them a pic and some details and you are set. The website is extremely popular and it's how I bought my car. Looking up similar cars to yours, I reckon you would get around £3500, but this could differ depending on milage etc. You can also check on the website how much similar cars are going for.. Don't trade your car in to ford or other garages! They rip you off. Selling direct through autotrader cuts out the middleman and saves u ££moolah££! . . Hope this helps, good luck!

In the modern sense of the word 'agnostic', nothing really.. . Historically, an agnostic was simply a person who claimed knowledge of god could not be obtained.  Today, the popular definition of agnostic is someone who hasn't "decided" whether or not god exists - which is the same as admitting there is no compelling evidence in favor of gods.  That's the same thing an atheist says.

The world goes the way of mankind... Is mankind getting any better??? I don't think so!!!  We are going downhill and we do not care about leading a moral and ethical life... we lie, cheat, steal, kill, verbally defame one another, and we don't think twice about doing these things... The next time you are tempted to lie, cheat, steal, speak unkindly about another... STOP... and change your action... and do something good... Try this at least one time a day... and maybe you can make you part of the world better and if we all did this... the world would be a better place. God does not punish the people... we get the fruits of our actions... if we act bad we are punished.. we get what we give out...  STOP BLAMING GOD!!!  LOOK TO YOURSELF... Are you doing the best you can in your life???

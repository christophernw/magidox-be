The same way to get good at anything, start doing it :).. . As a computer programmer im reading technical material all the time.  Some points.. . - Less is more.  Likely whoever reading this is pressed for time ( as everyone always is ).. - Don't use big words.  I hate reading a book riddled with complex words , especially when smaller ones will do.  Its usually painfully clear the author is out to impress his colleagues.. - Never use acronym's without spelling out what they mean first.  I absouletly despise this, and whats worse is I see it ALL THE TIME.. . Style is also important, but I think that will come with time.  Unfortunately almost all technical documents are written by techies, and as such usually suck, but try to find a few you like, and take notes on why you like it.. . . I am glad to see someone actually trying to be good at technical writing, it will be a welcome change to all of us, good luck!

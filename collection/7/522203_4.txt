in a situation like this sometimes words don't need to be spoken, just be there for your friend. actions speak louder than words. there is no set time to stop grieving. so if ur friend is still grieving 5 yrs later then so be it. if at times ur friend whats to be alone for a while then respect that but hopefully ur friend will be moving on with their life and doesn't let the grieving control their life. reassure them that their mother will always be in their hearts and their spirit will live on. hope this helps.

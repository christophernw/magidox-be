It depends on your situation. If you can afford to buy, do it. When you rent, you make payments and gain nothing but the retention of a roof over your head. If you're making payments towards buying a house you are gaining equity in the house. Increases in property value are yours!!! not your landlords. Meanwhile they're taking your rent and paying the mortgage on the place you're living in. So why not eliminate the middle man if you can. Build your own credit and equity.

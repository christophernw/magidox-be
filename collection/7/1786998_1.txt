In providing my answer, I assume you are talking about the behavior of the learner/student.. The whole educational process depends on behavior. Let's use good behavior as a standard.. Good behavior in a learning environment includes basic things like sitting still in class, listening to the teacher's instructions and teachings, following those instructions, keeping quiet when required to do so, and respectful behavior towards co-learners and teachers.. But it also includes doing homework on time, doing it to the best of one's ability and proper preperation for tests. . Good behavior isn't only "not to be naughty", but it's a mindset, an attitude towards learning, and towards life.. You can see for yourself how behavior will thus affect the educative process - good behavior will make for good students - students who are hard-working, dedicated, eager to learn, well-mannered, and smart. Any behavior deviating from this good behavior will impair a student's ability to "receive" what is being given to him/her during the educative process. . In short - an experienced teacher only has to look a student in the eyes for five minutes to know how well any educational instruction will be received in the mind of that student. Of course, a student's attitude can be changed through hard work by a very dedicated teacher. But, again, it has everything to do with behavior.

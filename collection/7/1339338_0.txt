I think dreams are a way for the brain to have release.  Just like we would sit down and read a book or whatever just to have a break.  Although, maybe sometimes dreams could be prophetic, just depends on how you look at it.  If we didn't have dreams, how would our brain discard all the junk that goes into it?-we would probably be out in the world doing some of the things that take place in our dreams and the world would be total chaos.

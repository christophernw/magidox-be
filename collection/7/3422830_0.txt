to Dog:  The center of the rotation of the moon around the earth is actually a couple hundred miles below the surface of the earth.  So like someone throwing the hammer in the olympics, the person isn't actuahlly the center, the center is nearer to the handle.  The center of rotation is NOT the center of the earth.

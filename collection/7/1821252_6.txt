I agree with the close minded thing.. The catholic church believes that only god can bring about life, and dna is the blueprint to life. They fear if we start bringing about life, then people would put two and two together, and the church would lose their precious power. It is the age-old conflict between logic and blind faith, because the only thing that can possibly defeat religion is the triumph of science.

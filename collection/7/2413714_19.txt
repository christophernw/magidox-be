An explosion is when a force rapidly expands outward from its source. A Fourth of July firecracker is an example..   An implosion is a rapid inward filling of a space. The only true implosion is a vacuum. If air is drawn out of a brittle container, such as a bottle. there is a point where the bottle can't hold against the outside air pressure. The bottle shatters inward..   On TV the razing of a building is often called an implosion. That's incorrect. Those reports should say that a number of small expolsions around the outer walls caused the building to collapse toward the center. It doesn't actually implode.

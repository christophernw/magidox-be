I agree with the above...Also, we achieve true happiness by becoming the divine beings that we were created to be.. . Study attributes and virtues...observe the way that nature is sustained and nurtured in order for us to be nurtured, and put acquired attributes into action.  When you act as the divine you achieve complete serenity and fulfillment.  You are able to see the interconnectedness of all things and you treat evey atom as if it is a part of who you are...as if it is something that you are responsible for.... . And then there is the task of finding real and euphoric music!  This brings elation to the "aware" soul!  (Or, of course, the soul seeking awareness...as one cannot truly say that they are fully "aware"). . Love ya, babe...Good Question!

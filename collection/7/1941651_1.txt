Because they dont realize that those big yummy eggs in a hawk and eagles next may also include the parents. . Crows dont just bother Hawks and Eagles they bother all other birds too, they are out to steal the eggs out of nests, they dont care who they steal from, if they can get away with it, then they have a free meal.. . I guess I am the only one who read the question right, I know you would never want to use a pressure washer in the house, I know I wouldnt want to. I have woodwork in my house and I have had to clean it thanks to my birds, what I do it I use some warm water and dish soap, once you get it all off dry the wood really good with a towel, now what I will usually do after that is I will use the Pledge Orange Oil. Makes the wood look really good. . . Sapphyre. Certified Avian Specialist. www.borrowed-rainbow.com. Join us at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BorrowedRainbowAviary/

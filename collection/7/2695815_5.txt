I don't agree with the answer about it causing diabetes.. It does have a bunch more cancer causing chemicals in it, but in all my years I have never heard of anyone getting cancer from it.. The harmful part of marajuana is that people become very apathetic (sp) or lazy from it.  I know I don't want to do much when I'm stoned, like look for a job, ect.  Also, short term memory is shot..... where was I?? lol, jk.

Hi there. I'm a Vet Assistant & have been asked this question before, so I hope I can be of assistance to you.  There's a static charge buildup before a thunderstorm that dogs can sense. This same static charge can produce lightening, if there is enough of it.  Dogs are afraid of the sensation this "charge" brings, thus explaining why some dogs become afraid and/or seek shelter when such a storm is approaching.

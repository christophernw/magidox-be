Bubbles are composed of the matter in which they originate in this instance, not involving decomposition.  They are made of gases dissolved in the water plus water itself in the vapor state (steam).. . 'Pure' substances, even some which are 'solid' can also boil when heated adequately.  The bubbles given off consist of the same material in a hotter, more energetic state. Some materials do not go through a liquid phase during this process, changing from solid directly into gaseous phase.. . If heat goes high enough, eventually a point is reached where molecular, and even atomic, disintegration occurs.. . Calcium is the most stable of all elements when it comes to destruction by heat.  It is a constituent of most ceramics which can take extremely high temperatures.. . The surface of the sun is boiling, they even have some pictures and video showing this.

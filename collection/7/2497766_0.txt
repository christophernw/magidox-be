Volunteer at your local church or at a nursing home.  If you play an instrument or sing then join the church choir.  If you join the church choir it takes care of the hours really quickly.  I do service hours at my church and I play my clarinet for 3 hours ever saturday.  Sometimes I sing too.  It's really fun and gets rid of the hours quickly

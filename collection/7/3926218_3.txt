Nothing exists without purpose. It is a vain to think so. Man's purpose of existence is precise: TO WORSHIP GOD, TO LIVE IN HARMONY WITH NATURE AND GOD'S CREATION WITHIN THE PERIMETER OF THE DIVINE LAWS AND PERMISSION GRANTED BY THE CREATOR HIMSELF!!. Science is the slave of Nature and Nature is VERY EXACT. So called "flaws in nature" have led to many a disaster. Man is now treading a thin line. It is time to take stock of our situation and save ourselves . It is never too late!

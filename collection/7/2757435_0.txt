There really isn't a single answer. A lot of things contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire including: Greed and avarice-- the people in power wanted more and more and they'd do anything to get it, the empire was too spread out to effectively manage, there wasn't enough money to maintain the roads and other municipal structures, the plague that hit Constantinople in around 500 ad and spread throughout the empire left the empire a lot poorer and without enough manpower to take care of the cities. Invaders also started battling against depleted and less qualified armies. Some people also suspect lead poisoning may have played a part in the fall of the empire.

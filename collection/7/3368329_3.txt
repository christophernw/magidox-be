like stated before, the preemptive strike is the most effective.. . BUT... WD-40 it a penetrating lube which means its designed to "eat" the things that case fasteners to freeze, sure enough it will also degrade rubber and foam rubber.. dont use the wd-40.. the same can be accomplished with a napkin and some butter or margarine . . but to remove ice that has already formed... you most likely wont tear the weatherstripping by pulling it open its actualy some pretty strong stuff, but if you dont want to chance it you can use isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), blow dryer, HOT water (make sure you dry the jamb thoroughly as to not cause a repeat.. . After you have dried it you can use butter, margarine, OR you can go to an auto parts store or walmart... and pick up a bottle of wax or Armor-All Original.. . retreat once a month for optimal effect.

Firstly, . to those who enjoy making themselves feel or seem superior and putting others down through making fun at other's english language skills: It doesn't make you seem any wittier, funnier, smarter, so quit those juvenile remarks - if you can't find a better quip, or don't know the answer, don't pretend to know or just put down all sorts of silly comments just for the 2 points!. The person bad at "English" could be much more fluent than you are at his language, maybe even others, than you are at your own! Be nice! This isn't a racial/cultural/language bashing forum!. . To answer the question:. . I think all politicians are corrupted, no matter where they're from.. How many have seen politicians from Africa who are filty rich, fly first class and live in huge houses with G5 security while half the local populace are dying from starvation or famine.. This is also so prevalent in Asian countries - politicians from Indonesia favour certain 'individuals' and pass out all kinds of handouts and perks to those individuals, be they relatives or friends. They swindle billions, like Suharto, (About US$35 billion) while the majority of their population is poor and ignorant, and the gap between the rich and poor widens.. In Mid-East, not only positive discrimination, but even more openly than Asia. Kings and princes, contacts, relatives, close friends openly swindle cash from the country's coffers like free bank accounts and freely do whatever they please, even if it's a crime or it's politically incorrect.. In Western countries, the corruption is much more subtle, but in NO WAY less than Asian and African countries. Bush had been exposed in many scandals, or having links to big company scandals.. . They say "Never trust a politician", and there's usually some truth in that. Many politicians lie in pure self-interest.. Bribery is rampant throughout the world.. . . Jenova. (d.yuffie@gmail.com)

I don't think you humanly and physically can be perfect. That is what the whole Old Covenant proved. Can't be done. . . And there is no need for it to be done. Laws don't make you perfect, laws make sin (imperfection). . The purpose of this life is the imperfection of it.. . Your spirit is perfect. I know I am perfect in this way. And so I have no worries about my physical and emotional imperfections. . . Ya, no worries or guilt. That is perfection.

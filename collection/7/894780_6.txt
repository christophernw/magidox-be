I believe that forgiveness is only given through Christ. No one, not a priest or minister, can get you forgiveness. I believe there are certain sins that can't be resolved without spiritual leaders getting involved, but most are between us and God. . . I believe if you pray, have remorse, know you have done something wrong and are truly ready to turn from that sin, then God will forgive you. . . The attonement was set up for us so that we could be forgiven of our sins, no matter how severe. It is through His atoning sacrifice that forgiveness is even possible.

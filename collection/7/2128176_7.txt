My way of handling this is to realize that ultimately the truth cannot be offended.  God is bigger than all this imo.  A self-righteous approach that would attack the jokers would not reflect a loving spirit but would be worse than making such jokes.  I think we are going through a time when traditional institutional religion is suffering some rejection as minds are opening to see that a more universal religious experience makes more sense.

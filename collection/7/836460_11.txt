My sister and I have had this problem quite a few times. Eventually it will get so painful that you'll have to go see the doctor. What he'll do is first inject the toe with novacaine. (it's best to close your eyes for this next part). Then he'll take pincers and curl the toenail back, basically disconnecting it from the tissue underneath. He will cut that toenail to ensure that it does not affect the infection. Next he will take the scalpel, cut open the infected part and attempt to locate the lost party. Once found, he will extract it, bandage you up, and Bob's your uncle. It sounds really bad, but believe me you'll feel much better physically and mentally. . . If you do not get it taken care of, there is a possibility that you will lose your toe, but there is a greater possibility that the infection will spread to your bloodstream. Then you're in big trouble. . . I hope this helps you and doesn't scare you. Go see a doctor toot sweet! Good luck.

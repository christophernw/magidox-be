The movie "saved" I think that was the title.  It had the kid from Home Alone and Mandy Moore in it.  It portrayed Christians in a very bad light.  Yes there, unfortunately, are those out there who step very eagerly into the role of the "church lady" or try to crawl into the judgement seat and tell people "you are going to hell."  The TRUTH is God does hate sin...but not sinners, there would be no hope for any of us if He did that.  As Christians, we should encourage others to turn away from sin.  It is difficult for many in this age of relitivity to accept the concept of right and wrong, but it is real.  Christianity is basically about love...God's love for ALL of us.  I have felt it in my life...I know that it is real.  I know that the Old Testiment is full of wars and death and many use that to say that God is bad and does hate people.  I will be honest, I don't have a real strong background in theology, so I'm not picking a theological fight.  What I do know is....Jesus Christ is my Savior...I feel his presence in my life everyday.  Christians want others to know that peace that comes with this relationship with Christ.  Your sins are for you to work out between you and the Lord.  It is the Christian's responsibility to help you... not condemn you...if you find one doing that, then maybe they aren't quite where they should be, or think they are, in their relationship with God.  No group should be judged as a whole by their worst examples.  Thanks for reading! Sorry so long!

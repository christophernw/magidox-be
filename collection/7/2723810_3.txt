Drive, drive, drive. If your family's going on a road trip, ask to drive (when I was learning, my parents NEVER let me drive anywhere, so this didn't work in my case). If you're going somewhere, take the long, scenic route. Drive on all kinds of roads, rural, suburban, city, highway, interstate, etc. Don't get distracted by the hot guy (or girl) in the Ferrari next to you. Don't get sidetracked by the beautiful scenery to your right or your left. Don't drool as you pass a Cold Stone. Keep your eyes in front with frequent (but not constant) checks into your mirrors. HAVE FUN!!! Don't think of driving as a chore, but as an activity. It's actually quite enjoyable. Oh, and don't get road rage. Traffic may seem like it sucks sometimes, especially when you're late, but just think of it instead as a moment to relax and listen to some good tunes or a book on tape.

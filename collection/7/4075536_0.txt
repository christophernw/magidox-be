There's no harm,. otherwise we all should have problem or be impotent even!. On the contrary, scientists says that a regular sexual life (mastu*bation too) helps the reproductive system to keep healthy, increasing the performance (libido) too.. Somebody even plays more time in a day and there’s no correlation with impotency or erection.. So, don’t worry for that, while you only ought to care to don’t become too much addicted.. Mastu*bation is a normal event, and with the age and stable relation should decrease till vanish.. Generally a couple of mastu*bation in a day shouldn't give pain, unless your penis doesn't get a skin inflammation.

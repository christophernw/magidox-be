well if you want to check your comp.on your car,you can use a on board key.just find the plug in ,on general motors its usually on the drivers side right under the dash.find treminal a and b and use the key(if you dont have a key,you can use a piece of covered wire)just keep the key off,and insert the key or wire into a and b ternimal and turn on the key(dont start the car or you could burn out the module)and count the flashes(like for instances  1 flash and it pauses and 2 more.that will do it for 3 times,then on the 4th time count the flashes just like the 1 and 2 ,then look at the manuel and it tells you what is the matter.good luck.

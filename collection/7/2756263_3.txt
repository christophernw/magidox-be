"I am who I am"  is the one that created us all.. its so awesome  to see how God made the earth, sky, people, animals....bloood, cells and veins in the body... so awesome....when i watched the tree that has the bloomings-white flowers ..i see "Beautiful"  out of the fruit tree ( cherry-blooming the tiny flowers) and i spoke out to God, ' You are beautiful!'.... God is beautiful because it proves enough of what we see the things on the earth so beauty so is GOD!. . http://spaces.msn.com/grimeaus/.  . http://ca.360.yahoo.com/profile-1D.ijRInfqhIjOR06aw.D6ZY9w--

Yes you are allowed to drink in a pub didn't you Dad tell you these things. Regards smoking in a pub why should nonsmokers be put off their drinking because of some inconsiderate people, doing something that is not natural?And smoking stinks your clothes as well as damaging you lungs.You can control your drinking but you can't control some one smoking.

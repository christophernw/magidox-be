My sister-in-law was going to try to be a pharmacists and it was going to take about 8 years to complete all the classes you have to take to get qualified, but if you're really interested in doing it I know alot of drug stores like Walgreens offer scholarships for it.  You have to sign something saying you'll work for them for a few years after graduation, but it's a pretty good deal.

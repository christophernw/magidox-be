i would say its both the pill shouldn't be exposed to sunlight. .because im a type 1 diabetic and have never been told not to be out in the sun for too long as a diabetic only for the same reasons as everyone else would be concerned about. Also alot of medications can make you burn easier so it could also be because the pills make you more prone to being burnt while in the sunlight

with a headache i reckon!ive got a fezzy mk4 and my advice would be dont bother i mean whats the point?put a set of 14 inch four spoke ford factory wheels on it!putting 17's on it is just gonna bring you more trouble than its worth first youll have to have your speedo calibrated to your larger wheels and you will find the acceleration will be greatly reduced as well as never being able to drive over a speed bump again and never doing a three point turn!trust me i had a set of 15's five spoke wheels which i then swapped for the four spoke fezzy wheels!it looks silly people will point and laugh save your money and put it towards a car that is designed to run with 17in wheels!

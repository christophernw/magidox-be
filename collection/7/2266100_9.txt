I used to have that problem.  Try taking sleeping pills and then slowly stop taking them and maybe that will help. Also try not watching tv or doing anything and maybe lay down an hour or something before you normally go to bed and maybe that will help you fall asleep easier. Maybe instead of sleeping with your radio on get a fan or something that makes noise and try listening to that for awhile. Try to close your door and block out all the light that might come in from the window. These things might help.

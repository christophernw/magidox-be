It doesn't.. . One line of reasoning is this.. . As evolution is a gradual process and it is almost impossible to pinpoint exactly when a species becomes a new species.  Atheists argue that to say god waited till humans developed into a new species and then started inserting souls is a little absurd.. . Additionally if you support a literal translation of the bible, then evolution and an old earth is in opposition to creationism.  If the bible is wrong here, where else is it wrong?  How is it inspired by God?  If you don't think it is all literal, then there is no problem.. . But I don't think evolution proves or disproves a deity, just explains how all animals, including humans, came to be on this planet.  If you want to think God started the whole thing off, then took a back seat, then thats up to you, evolution doesn't say anything about this.

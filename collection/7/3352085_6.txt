I have kept many house snakes in the past, they are nothing to be afraid of.  Most of them are pretty docile, you could probably pick it up without it getting upset.  My advice is to take an empty pillow slip and coax the snake into it.  Then tie an knot in the top and take it somewhere safe to release it.

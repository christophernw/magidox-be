mostly only americans serve salad 1st & my guess is if u fill up on salad & bread (which are inexpensive) you won't want so much of the expensive food.  Really good restaurants do not serve salad 1st & know u are prepared to wait for fine food and pay the price for fine food. Americans are not always good at waiting so u get salad and bread 1st.

Being assertive and being defensive are pretty much polar opposites.. . You can be more assertive by simply asking for / telling people what you need / want.  It sounds simple but a LOT of people have a lot of time expressing their desires.. . As for defensiveness – being defensive is simply when you are trying to defend your self from the views and actions of others.  One way to stop doing that is to stop arguing and disagreeing with people.  Try to never tell any one that they are wrong – simply state your beliefs.  It sounds cheesy – but use “I” statements a lot, and try not to use the word “NO.”  So when some one says “Your a JERK.”  You say – “I am sorry you feel that way.”  A defensive person will say “NO I’m NOT – YOUR the JERK, JERK!”  Or when some one says “George Bush is the greatest president EVER.”  You say – “I tend to think that any president who advocates the use of torture, and violates the constitution he is sworn to protect by illegally wire tapping Americans, and takes the country to war under false pretenses, and who tries to legislate his own draconian morality cannot very well be describes as a good president.”  A defensive person would say “No he is NOT!!!  W. is a LOOOOOOSER...”

This is an excellent question.  Let me tell you what I have learned, and I hope this will help you as you explore your cat’s relationship with water.   It is not true that cats are afraid of water, but the truth is equally as amusing, especially to our scientifically advanced species.  I’m sure you’ll enjoy.. . Cats are seemingly afraid of water because they understand it’s awful and terrifying power, as relayed down the cat generations through stories and songs (“meaow-yow-yow”, in their native tongue).  All cat cultures around the world, despite their differences, have in common a fable involving a mighty cat leader (or “yow-meow”) and how he bargained with the Lord of Dead Cat Souls not to unleash a dark torrent of feline tears upon primal cat-dom, a giant reservoir of pain and misery that predates human reckoning back to the era of the Dark Gods, ancient and unknown.  This great and deep well of tears looked to the mighty cat shaman as a mammoth “”yow-yow” (or “monsoon” in our parlance) poised to flood the world live a wave of misery and horror.  The chieftain (some record his name as “Meow”, others variantly as “Meaow”, while a disparate few cat-cultures in the far East note his name as “Reggie”) according to legend sacrificed his own life to stave off the deadly wave, thereby saving all of cat-dom for future generations.  . . Therefore cats today are not truly afraid of water, but instead honor their legendary ancestor-hero by respecting water, which they see as the damp and liquidic tomb of great and fallen Meow (or “Meaow”).

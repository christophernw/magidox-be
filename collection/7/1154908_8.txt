No i dont hate black man, they dont affect my life in any given way, I dot have anything agaisnt them it is just another human being like anyone else. You need to be more open minded, they are rised with oppression because other people makes them feel that way. There are intelligent african mericas, that exceeded in achievements and accomplishments and there are other african americans that do not even want to exceed, and stay in poverty and living off well-fare all their life.

So for you labor is only a good, a thing to be bought and sold at will? This is perhaps the major flaw in your argument.. . Before you react, remember also that the EU does not allow rampant illegal immigration. Their governments still have the final say on how many people enter their country. And they also crack down on illegal immigration you know.. . And Asia too cracks down on illegal immigrants (just look at China silly).. . People are not goods, and Illegal Immigration is not the same as Legal (legit) Immigration or Economies. Remember that next time.

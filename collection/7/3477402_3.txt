It really depends where you want to work.  If you want to work in the US you are probably better off(especially financially) sticking with a school in the US.  If you want to work in Europe(or Latin America) then getting a degree there might be a good idea.  It might also be a good way to test out whether you like living and/or traveling abroad.. . Ulitmately only you really can answer whether the experience is worth the extra cost.

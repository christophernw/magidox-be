Try taking a more libertarian look at what makes a sin.  The view is more of: You can do anything you want, so long as it does not infringe on someone else's right to do the same.  For instance, driving too fast down a road may kill someone else, so that is bad.  Smoking in a small area infringes on other people right to clean air.  Knocking on my door on a saturday morning to tell me about a murderous deity infringes on my right to have a peaceful morning.

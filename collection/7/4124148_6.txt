Surely you are not suggesting that conversions be outlawed.  This would seem a very harsh repression of freedom.  Conversions take on aggressive traits because they are, in my estimation, at the heart of a global battle between good and evil.  I think that using freely offered 'lures' are ethical, in the sense of advertisement, while coercion and discrimination are not ethical.  If I can give you a chance of eternal benefit, would it not be wrong to withhold that?

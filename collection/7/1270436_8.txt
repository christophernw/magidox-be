I feel that the reason for high gasoline prices is that people are just plain using too much of the stuff.  When the price gets too high people will stay at home and then and only then will the price come down. . . Case in point is in the winter months when kids are in school and the moms and dads can not take vacations, they tend to stay at home, thus less gasoline is used and the price goes down.. . Also, the big gas companies have shut a lot of the little refineries, lets just say the independent refiner, down and they no longer can buy the crude at the same price as the big boys and that has really hurt.  We can no longer have hits in the system like we did when the hurricanes hit the coast.. . Refiners want their plants running at top flow rates. (This is a term that is called thruput). This is the secret to making money in the refineries these days.  To put it simply, the more crude oil that you cram in your refinery, the more gasoline, diesel, kerosene and other money making products you get to sell.  That all translates into $$$$$$$.  All this without added machinery or manhours.

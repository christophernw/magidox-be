I'm not sure if you asked this question for laughs--a pun or play on words, or for a serious reason. "The world is getting smaller" is an idiomatic expression. You can't take it literally, like the globe has shrunk. It simply means that life has become easier than before because of technological advancement, especially in transportation and communications. . . On the other hand, the increase in price of stamps has nothing to do with "the world shrinking". Distance from one place to another doesn't change--it is the mode of transportation that changes and improves over time. In the meantime, oil price increases which triggers an increase of prices of other commodities.

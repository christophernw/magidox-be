A coma is a deep state of unconsciousness, during which an individual is not able to react to their environment. Someone in a coma cannot respond to any form of stimulation whatsoever. Coma can be caused by an underlying illness, or it can result from head trauma. While a concussion is a brief (seconds to minutes) loss of consciousness caused by a blow to the head.

The tone of something is the mood in which it's written; for example, a lively and joyful tone might have lots of positive words like "sunny" and "cupcakes," while also having an overall message that could be seen as positive by the reader.  An essay could have an informal tone if it included many slang words like "hella" or "wicked cool".  Think of a letter to a friend: it has a casual, easygoing tone and might include slang and personal stories, while a letter to company would have a formal tone that includes many businesslike and professional words and phrases.  The same is true of essays--they need to be adjusted according to your audience.

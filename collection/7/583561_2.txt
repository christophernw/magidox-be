I am going to answer your question by asking one. How should the people who went thru slavery for centuries be compensated? And who benefit from affirmative action the most? Is it not white women? If there is no affirmative action, people will deny other race just because of skin color. And it is a way to rapid the process of the getting the less fortunate up to the top. That is my take to this.

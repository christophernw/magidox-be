Try and make your revision 'pro-active', take notes, split your subject up into different headings and make relevant notes and questions and answers for each heading.. . If you just 'read' your books, the chances are you will get bored and will not really absorb the information (though it depends, I had friends who would just 'read' a book and get great grades!). . It all depends on how YOU work best, though I would recommend trying to make it a bit more than just reading, get the mind flowing buy note taking and also pratice exam questions.. . Good luck!

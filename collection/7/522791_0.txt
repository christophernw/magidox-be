I think this shows u bombed the interview - . 1. They explain you their procedure of hiring and end with " we are still interviewing some candidates and shall make a decision next week or towards the end of this week.". 2. when they smile at you and say thanks and we shall let you know.. 3. when they start with a scowl.. 4. when they just ask you 2 questions and you are done.. 5. when they ask you if u have any questions for them and just answer them real short.. 6. when they say - we apprecaite ur coming hear and sparing some time for us.. 7. when they hardly talk or appear disinterested. . . btw goodluck if ur still looking

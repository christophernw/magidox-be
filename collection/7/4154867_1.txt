It depends.  Are they just squeaking (which usually indicates that you are at the warning tabs) or do they sound like they are grinding?  If just squeaking, you can go another month or 2.  If they are grinding, it probably means that you've already gone thru the pad and now you are just grinding your rotors.  If that happens, not only do you get poor braking, you also have to replace your rotors as well as your pads.  Don't let it get this far.

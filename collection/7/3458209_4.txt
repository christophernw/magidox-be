You should speak and read as much English as you can, and also listen to the BBC World Service, especially the news and information programmes. This will give you many new words and also proper pronounciation.. . If you like to start a written correspondence in English, feel free to contact me. I lived in India as a boy, I like the country and people and I would be happy to help you.

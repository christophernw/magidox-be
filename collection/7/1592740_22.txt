Because were vegetarian! I've been one for almost three years. I don't believe that we should kill innocent animals just to eat. There are so many more choices out there which don't involve a dead animal. When you eat meat, you're eating rotting flesh of a murdered creature. . . I don't remember who said this but I always carry it with me: "Now I can look at you in peace. I don't eat you anymore." I live in Texas, and anywhere I go, I have to drive past a cattle field. I don't want to look at them at wonder if I'll be eating one of them in a burger next week.. . Being a vegetarian also has many medical benefits. Vegetarians have lower blood pressure, lower risk of heart disease, and have many other health benefits.. . I truly believe that becoming a vegetarian was one of the best decisions of my life. I feel better about myself and I'm healthier. I've become a better person.

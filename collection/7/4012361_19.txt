I had a similar situation and I called my local vet and they let me set up a payment plan as I was rescuing a cat.  The vet also might be willing to take the kittens after the are born to adopt them out or I hate to say it but the vet can also abort them if the cat is not too far along.  Or/and the vet, if she is pregnant should be able to tell you how many kittens she is having and you can always ask your friends, family, and co-workers if they want to adopt a kitten when they are born.

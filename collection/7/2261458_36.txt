My parakeet died because the air conditioner was too cold in my house. We had him 5 years and he could talk. I hated him,and I loved him. I was so sad when he died and I felt so guilty. It was so quiet in my house. I buried him with his favorite toy in a cigar box in my yard. I miss him. I did get another bird, but it wasn't the same. Wait a little while, a month or so I'd suggest.. Sorry for your loss!

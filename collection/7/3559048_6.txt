I think you can sell a junk car to a junk yard with out a title, since they'll be scrapping it for parts. And If they do happen to get the clunker road worthy again, then the junk yard can apply for a salvage title so they can sell the car again.. . Other than that, I don't know of any other way. Best to call your counties clerks office and find out if there's any other way available to you.

Yes, unless your an American Indian your an immigrant.  But, illigeals are a problem, they carry in all kind of disease and can over run our country.  Do you think that an illegal without a SS # pays taxes.  Where do you think they go when they get sick and who do you think pays for it.  If you want to be an American, I have no problem with that, hell most of our own people couldnt pass the test to become a citizin, but do it right.

i live in dalton ga and here it is the carpet capital of the wrold when all the plants started in the 1980's-1990's they needed lots of cheap wokers so they put big billboards in mexico and california to advertise jobs they also went and picked them up so for many yeah it was easier to get on a bus for a free ride to a good job in the good ole USA

In Catholic theology, it's a two step process (for adults). First, you find a faith relationship with Jesus-who-is-God; this introduction is called a "baptism by desire.". . Then, the community celebrates your entrance into the Christian faith with a "sacrament of baptism," the ritual with water and holy oils.. . Some Protestant churches are more fundamental; the water rite is your entrance into the community. Others are quite liberal (you become "saved" when you choose to be "saved").. . If you've decided to become a Christian, then, in fact, you have already become one! Now you have to find a community that shares your beliefs and challenges you to grow spiritually. That's a different question!

Cats have whiskers for many reasons.  Whiskers help a cat's equilibrium, making them balanced.  If one side is shorter than the other cats will not be able to walk straight and will fall over constantly.  They also help for detecting stuff, such as wind changes and whatnot.  They help the cat navigate more or less.. . . . Second, the width from one whisker to the other is the width of a cat's body.  Whiskers help a cat sense if he will be able to fit through a space.

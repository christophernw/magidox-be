Read Matt 24 & Mark 13 & Luke 21 things are going to get worse as we near the end. The reason is people are turning away from  God. Instead of living the way He says they do things their own way. Blessings if we obey & curses if we don't. In Matt. 24:3 or 4 Jesus said many would come in His name saying He was Christ yet deceive many. This is talking about false preachers. They say Christ died for you, yet the message they preach is false. Satan has them & they don't know it most of the time. Remember it says the many! Read your bible daily, check up on what you hear & read! In the end you'll answer for you!

Well it depends on what aspect of power we're looking at.. . The Roman Empire I think had one of the most lasting impressions and influences.. Gengkis Kahn (sp?) had the largest empire, but his reign was short-lived and his heirs did not make it last.. Alexander the Great had a pretty large empire but I forgot why it was so important.. The German empire led by Hitler was one of the most recent, I think, and it was also quite powerful.

It was played as a theme song to the illegal immigrant protests.  Kidron (the British Dude) was tickled by the idea of stirring up we poor provincial nativists.  Unfortunately he didn't stop to consider (or perhaps didn't care) what this would mean to real human beings caught in the backlash. He now says he was just trying to bolster identification with the anthem, but then how does he explain the altered version he came out with turning the anthem into a doggerel theme song against immigration law enforcement? (It includes questions about how can we enforce these 'mean laws' against the 'hard workers' that I assure you are not in the original.). . I don't have a problem with people in any language expressing patriotism to this country, so long as that is what it is.  The message of when and how it was put out, along with groups touting Atzlan slogans and flying our flag upside down, gave it very different color.. . Kidron is here on a visa as I understand it. I hope any deportation feeling stirred up by his actions includes him, as well.

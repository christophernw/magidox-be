Coke is filtered through membranes made from the intestines of porcine (pigs) species.....Oh, and you sitting there with a bottle of Coke, take a nail and drop it in the bottle of Coke and see what happens after a week.....the nail will have been dissolved by the phosphoric acid in the beverage, and that crap is going in your stomach.....And while we're at it, WINE DOES contain remenants of fish, as the scales are used as membranes which are used to filter sediment out of wine before it is bottled......Interesting, huh?????

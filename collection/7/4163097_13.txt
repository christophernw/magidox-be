I don't think that he did mean it that way, he was probably trying to make a joke at the presidents expense and it went wrong. BUT, he didn't say look at President Bush at the end. He just made it look as though he bashed the troops. It really doesn't matter if you don't finish school that you end up in the Military(look at Kerry, who people say got lower grades than Bush and look where he ended up. MILITARY!, he must think that he's living proof) it doesn't matter what he TRIED to say. The fact is that he said it and that one of the most respected politicians(even though he's a republican, democrats respect this guy) John McCain said that Kerry should apologize. Yeah, he tried to make a joke, and now he should have just apologized and not done damage control at this point, bashing everybody who misquoted him(even though, you can clearly see it on video) So, since you won't hear a sincere apology out of him, I'll do it for him. I'm sorry. I won't say another word about it. Especially when I'm trying to win points with my party for a 2008 election by helping them get control of congress back

Catholics don't eat meat on Fridays during the Lent season 40 days from Easter because they are fasting like Christ did 40 days (in the desert) before he died on the cross. That is the reason why people say they gave up .... for lent. They usually give up something they really enjoy so that they can have an idea of what it was like for Christ to suffer without for that period of time. If there is a monetary value attached they save that money and give it to the church for the poor who do suffer on a continual basis. And actually, the old way was to not eat at all on Good Friday. To fast the entire day and then go to mass. After Mass they eat.

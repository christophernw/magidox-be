Late? How late? It may take time to find the best person for you. It may take to grow into the person who appeals to the kind of man you want. I know a woman who married at 18, divorced at 24 then dated 20 years before find the person she was best suited to. SHE DIDN'T SETTLE! "ill-effect of late marriage"...I don't know what you're talking about.

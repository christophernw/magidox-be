There are two types of atoms,. 1. Electropositive atoms: they tend to loose the outer most valence electron on action of external energy. They are mostly reducing agents.. 2. Electronegative atoms: they tend to adsorb an excess electron from the valence bond of an adjacent matter to form a neagative ion. they are generally oxidising agents like non metals.

The space agencies are trying the best but most of the funds are going to war and charities, ESA are wishing but NASA are going to do so soon.. Other space agencies are looking at it, this maybe another race to space, the race to Mars.. The purpose to go to Mars is to see the planet, investigate and see through for a human eye, not because there is life or no life.. There will be no killer asteroid yet, but if so the mission coming up,we will have to build colonies on Mars and The Moon if The Moon survives an asteroid impact to the Earth too.. . Corrections to your question, I'm educated more than you.. . Why have there not been any manned missions to Maars yet?. What are you waiting for you goons, should not the government be putting more money in research. In order to prevent the Earth from being destroyed by killer asteroids.. . Meteors though if to collide.. Meteories are small meteors.. It maybe an asteroid or comet to follow the path of a meteor.. . Also the fact it takes a long time to get to Mars and back and the matter of landing and surviving.. . Note: Always go into slang in speech marks or stars.

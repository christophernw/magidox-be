This thought is the leading ideea from "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", and belongs to the prophet which gives the title of the book. With this motto is born the Ãœbermensch, the Overman , the superior man that surpasses the human condition and is the master of his own destiny, because God was just a man's invention generated by fear and weakness, by the need to be a slave. The Overman knows that he is on his own in the world and creates his own values. "God is dead" means that the concepts imposed by christianism have no meaning anymore.

Some plants reproduce vegetatively.  This means they send out runners or "pups" which will grow into new plants.  Other plants will have parts such as leaves or stems which, if they fall off the mother plant, will produce adventitious roots and grow into a new plant.  The drawback to this vegetative reproduction is that it is the same as cloning and it does not result in any genetic diversity (in some specialized niches this may be an advantage).

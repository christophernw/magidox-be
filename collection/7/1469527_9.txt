It's the fall velocity at which air resistance exactly balances gravitational force, so the falling object no longer accelerates. However, it varies with air density, which changes as the falling object's altitude declines. Gravitational force also changes with altitude because it depends on the distance to the earth's center. As a result, a falling object is hardly ever going to fall at exactly its terminal velocity, since it has to "chase" the changing value of that velocity.

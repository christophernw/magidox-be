It is an antibiotic resistant strain of bacteria. Many people have it. It is quite common in the hospitalized population in the US. In the ICU where I work, I would estimate 10% of our patients have it. Ten years ago it was very rare, but has spread rather aggressively. I have treated HUNDREDS of patients with MRSA and it isn't true that it always eats away at your skin. That condition is called "necrotizing fasciitis". Although MRSA can cause that condition(as well as other organisms)it almost never does. Of the hundreds of cases of MRSA I've seen, I've only seen 2 cases of NF.

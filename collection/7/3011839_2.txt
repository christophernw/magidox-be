If you don't commit a crime, there will be no cause for the judge to issue an arrest warrant.  Until that warrant is issued, you will have no participation in its application or its issuance.  HOwever, once it's issued, you may attack the warrant on the basis of lack of probable cause.. . You'll need a lawyer for that.

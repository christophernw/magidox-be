To facilitate the learning of students.. . Teachers are there to help present the material in a manner that the students can understand & then it is up to the student to do the rest.. . However, I have found that nowadays students don't study. What is up with that?. . When I was in school, the teacher presented the material then you went home & studied for the test.. . Teachers can not magically place information into the brains of students. We can try to get their attention, you know, peak their interest. But it is up to them to do the studying.

Because what Trent Lott said at a private birthday party shouldn't matter.  It is only the BIASED liberal media that made such a molehill into a gigantic mountain.  If the situations were reversed, you wouldn't have heard a word about a Democrat making such comments.. . Don't believe me?  Consider this:. . On April 1, 2004, on the floor of the United States Senate, Democratic senator Chris Dodd said the following about Senator Robert Byrd, who’d just cast his 17,000th roll call vote: “I do not think it is an exaggeration at all to say to my friend from West Virginia that he would have been a great senator at any moment. Some were right for the time. Robert C. Byrd, in my view, would have been right at any time. He would have been right at the founding of this country. He would have been in the leadership crafting this Constitution. He would have been right during the great conflict of Civil War in this nation. He would have been right at the great moments of international threat we faced in the 20th century. I cannot think of a single moment in this Nation’s 220-plus year history where he would not have been a valuable asset to this country.. . Senator Christopher Dodd, a Democrat, said those words about a former Klu Klux Klan member.  He said those words about a man who once wrote that he would rather see the US lose World War 2 than to see "negroids" serving in the armed forces next to white men.. . Funny thing, you didn't hear much about Dodd's speech in the media, now did you?. . And I don't recall anyone calling for Dodd to resign. Do you?. . The double standards of liberal Democrats is astounding.  This is just another example.. . Lott should serve as long as the likes of Dodd and Byrd are supported by dimwitted liberals who selectively choose their outrage.

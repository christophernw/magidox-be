If God really exists then He should be a God who has the power to dispense punishment and reward. If not then he is a lame duck god wouldn't he? If he is a lame duck god then he is no god at all.. . A person who doesn't love God will not find a place in heaven because obviously he will not find it such a grand place since it will be a location that is filled with God's glory. It will be like punishment for him to be there because He never wanted to do anything with God here on earth in the first place!. . Now will he enjoy hell? Of course not. Who would enjoy a slimy pit full of cries of anguish. That is why those who dislike God condition themselves to think that there is no God and that this life will eventually be meaningless since you will just be turned into dust when you die.. . This is a "nowhere to go" philosophy.

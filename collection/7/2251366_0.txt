If it is in the mouth the best remedy to use is a Jam made out of Rose petals. This is a russian folk remedy, and your best choice to find it would be in russian grocery or Jon's (if you have such store in your area). You just dip your finger and swipe it on the areas affected by thrush. This is best for kids. If is it an adult, you can try rinsing your mouth with 1/2 peroxide and 1/2 water mixture. Good luck.

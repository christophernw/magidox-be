what facts are they questioning. I mean you have to always question the facts how else do you find out new stuff. If we didn't we would still believe the earth was flat, the moon is made of cheese, it will stop your heart if you go more then 35mph and all the other wrong stuff that used to be facts. . . As for getting a better job and life. What else motivates you to do a good job. You want a raise, a promotion, your company to grow. How many people would volunteer for overtime if they had to do it for free. I mean do you seek to have less money and a worse life style. If so I can help you message me and i will give you a P.O. box to mail money to so you don't have as much.. . as for you scam thing I'm not sure what you are trying to ask. If you are asking why people fall for them. It is because they are dumb. If someone is smart enough to trick you out of your money you deserve to lose it for being dumb.

the embryonic skeleton is first made of cartilage and ossification begins in the third month of gestation in the long bones, Long bones also develop centers of ossification at their epiphysis. Growth of long bones continues at the epiphyseal disc  at the junction of the diaphysis(shaft) and epiphysis (end) An epiphyseal disc is still cartilage and more bone is produced on the epipysis side. On the diaphysis side osteoblasts produce bone matrix to replace this cartilage. Between 16 and 21 yrs of age,( influenced by testosterone or estrogen)all cartilage of the epipyseal discs is closed by bone and bone growth stops

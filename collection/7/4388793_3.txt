Go you. That's not obsessed, that is just average. If you want someone who is obsessed, then find someone who goes to opening parties dressed up like a character, has mmorized the books, and is a member of every HP fansite known to man.. Oh wait, I think I just described myself. That's not good. You're not the obsessed one, I am.

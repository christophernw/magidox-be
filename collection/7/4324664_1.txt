Down the shitter, thank God. I heard they were going to start talking to the AMERICAN public(not illegals) on the issue, about time. If it is up to me it will NEVER pass.. . From what I have been hearing on the news most people on the border states are FED up with it too. And as far as Arnold goes... well I won't say what I think, but he is a traitor also. He is NOT for this country if he wants illegals taking over the country.

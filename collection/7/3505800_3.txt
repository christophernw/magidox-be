Kamikaze (神風) is a word of Japanese origin, which in the English language usually refers to suicide attacks carried out by Japanese military aviators against Allied shipping towards the end of the Pacific campaign of World War II.. . Air attacks were the predominant and best-known aspect of a wider use of—or plans for—suicide attacks by Japanese personnel, including soldiers carrying explosives, and boat crews (see Japanese Special Attack Units).. . Since the end of the war, in 1945, the word kamikaze has often times been applied to other varieties of attack in which the attacker is sacrificed in the process. This is a wider variety of suicide attacks, in other historical contexts. Examples of these are the proposed use of Selbstopfer aircraft by Nazi Germany and various suicide bombings by terrorist organizations around the world, such as the September 11, 2001 attacks. Hyperbolic usage also includes non-fatal attacks which result in significant loss for attackers, like the end of their career.. . The September 11, 2001 attacks (often referred to as 9/11 [1]) were a series of coordinated terrorist attacks upon the United States of America carried out on Tuesday, September 11, 2001. That morning, nineteen men affiliated with al-Qaeda[2][3] [4] hijacked four commercial passenger jet airliners. The attackers crashed two planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, one plane into each tower, causing the collapse of both towers within two hours. Hijackers of the third aircraft crashed that plane into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia. Passengers on the fourth hijacked aircraft attempted to retake control of their plane from the hijackers, which crashed into a field in rural Somerset County, Pennsylvania. Approximately 3,000 people died in these attacks. Affected property owners and their insurers incurred billions of dollars in damages.

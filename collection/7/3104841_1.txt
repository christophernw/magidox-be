If guinea pigs won't eat there is something wrong and they need to go to a vet.  The nails are pretty easy to cut but if you are uncomfortable have the vet show you how to do it.  I use a regular nail clipper because the nails are small enough and the human nail clipper is easier to handle.. This site is good for clipping nails.. http://www.guinealynx.info/nails.html. This is a general care page.. http://www.2ndchance.info/guineapigcare.htm. http://www.ahc.umn.edu/rar/MNAALAS/GPig.html

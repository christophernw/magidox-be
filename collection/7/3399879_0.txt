Seagulls (and most birds) have pretty simple brains. Rather than individual personalities, they have species personality traits ... know one seagull, you pretty much know them all.. So the stimuli that cause one seagull to look "east" will cause all seagulls to look "east." If they are standing near each other, they will all be experiencing similar stimuli.. Schools of fish demonstrate similar behavior.

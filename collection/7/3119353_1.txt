Ignore the people who suggest that you let your cat "get some."  Be a responsible pet owner and get her to a veterinarian to be spayed.  The vet can also ensure that there is no other problem, since other illnesses could cause this to happen.. . Don't add to the millions of unwanted animals in the world--even if the kittens go to a good home initially, there's no guarantee that they won't end up in a shelter later, b/c unfortunately many people don't have enough commitment to keep the pet for life.. . Get your cat fixed, and then both of your lives will be easier.

A single word cannot be copyrighted.  It can be a trademark, but that's different.  If you are not using it as a trademark yourself, I can't see what the problem is.. . On all these "infringement" questions, common sense and your own experience must rule the day.  Haven't you seen words and phrases, names even, that are used in normal newspapers, magazine articles, and books?  People say things like "I'll go get a Coke."  If it was illegal to use a trademarked name in that way, we'd never be able to say anything!  . . The basic rule in copyright is that if the ideas are, to your conscious mind, original to you, go ahead and use them.  If you purposely quote someone else, put it in quote marks and attribute it.  But if you just happen to choose the same words someone else in the past has used, that would not be an infringement.  However, if your entire chapter (or even a significant part of it) is word-for-word the same as someone else's, you're going to have trouble convincing a jury that you did not copy.. . Mama always said if you are honest, you don't have to worry about being sued.  That's something of an exaggeration in this modern litigious age, but it's about as good as we've got.  At least you don't have to worry about winning if you are sued!

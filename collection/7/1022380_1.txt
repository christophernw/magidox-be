in a broad sense, it means anything which would affect the outcome of the case....documents needed to prove your allegations in the matter...without knowing what your exact circumstances are...I cannot give you an idea as to what the pertinent information could be...but as an example:.   I paid off this bill and these creditors are still trying to collect more...then a receipt or cancel check showing the balance was paid would be pertinent to the case....Good Luck!!

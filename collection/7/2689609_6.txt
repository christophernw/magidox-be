Because people dont like to change or admit that anything is wrong. This goes from the personal level all the way up to the general public. If it doesn't affect me directly, Im going to ignore it because all it will do is bring me down, since I know my small contribution cannot stop it.. .  And the people that have the power and wealth will do ANYTHING to keep it.

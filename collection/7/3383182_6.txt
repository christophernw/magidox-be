What you say is not correct, in the history some airplanes with forward swept wing were built.. Forward swept wing was the answer to a problem presented by swept back wings: at high speeds airflow were deflected far from control surfaces, so the plane became uncontrollable.. The first airplane with forward swept wing was the Ju-287 built in Germany during WW2, it was a four jet engine powered bomber.. More recently also in HFB-320, X-29, F-16FSW and Su-47"Berkut" this architecture was applied.. This architecture is very problematic because the wing is aerodynamically unstable, in fact when a normal wing is flexed the load doesn't increase because the angle of attack remains the same for straight wing and decreases for back-swept wing, but in forward-swept wing the angle of attack increase and this make the aerodynamic load increase, and this can break the wing.. The only way to esc this circle is to build the wing structure with a material in witch a flexion causes a torsion in order to avoid any increasing of angle of attack. In fact forward swept wings are made more practical by composite materials, in witch this is possible.. In conclusion we can say that the advantages of forward swept wing don't usually justify the increase of weight due the structure that must be more rigid, and the increase of cost due to the more complex design process and due to the large use of the expensive composite materials..

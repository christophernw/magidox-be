Well, exploitation usually refers to victimizing someone in one way or another, and I don't really see how advertising does that. I guess you could make the argument that it makes us victims of the things we own and want to own, like our materialism gets in the way of actually living. I also supposed that if the advertising has a negative impact, for example super-skinny models effect the self-image of teenagers in an unrealistic way, then that is kind of exploitative, in a way.

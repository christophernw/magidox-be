I think the government should just make them legal like cigarettes.  There is nothing wrong with wanting to smoke a joint or something to cure a headache. I mean really, that is better that taking a Percocet or something and impairs driving less (not that I am condoning driving while on anything.)  People are such hypocrites too when it comes to drugs, everyone just needs to relax....

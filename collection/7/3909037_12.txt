to get rid of them do the following: . . Pray to Jesus, ask Him to come into your heart and your life and save you from your sins. . . Then: get rid of any occultic things in your home (witchcraft and other occult books and items, idols, ouija boards, etc), and then . .. .  start reading the Bible (beginning with the Gospel of John (the 4th book in the New Testament), and then obey what God tells you to do (and obey what Jesus said to do).. . Start reading the Bible every single day, praying to God every single day asking Him to help you live for Him, and asking Him for forgiveness for your sins, and start going to church (a church that preaches and believes the Bible) every single Sunday morning.. . Stop hanging around with people that don't love God, and start hanging around with people who DO love God (most likely these are the kind of people you will meet at a good Bible-believing church). . If you'll do these things, and sincerely obey the Gospel of Jesus (Gospel means "good news" (it's the good news that we can be forgiven of our sins and go to Heaven to be with the Lord forever instead of where we all deserve to go forever after this life (Hell)). . . . . if you'll do these things, the demons will leave you (in fact, the Bible says they will flee from you).  They will still attack you occasionally when they can, but they won't control you and you won't be in fear anymore, and you will have power over them.. . good luck and God bless you.

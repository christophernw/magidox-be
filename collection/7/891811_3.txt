There are two kinds of physical orgasms--vaginal and clitoral.. When stimulated long enough, muscles spasm and contract, causing a wonderful eruption of "love juices" Other symptoms you are orgasming are:      1. Your toes curl or stiffen..                                               2. nipples get hard.                                               3. cheeks flush.                                               4. lower jaw extends slightly. Eyes may close and moans may escape. Your whole body may shutter. You may grip things, like his a-s or shoulder. You may hold your breath. Your tummy feels "funny", especially low.  It's also important to note that it is highly difficult for most women to orgasm without clitoral stimulation added. Highly unlikely. (To others reading and doubting this--don't lie).

Because they are STUP-IT! Never, ever, ever, try to burn your neighbors leaves, (such as in a ditch) with a flaming cross. I just use a little lighter fluid, and ignite the leaves with a lighter. I did it today, no bad results. Keep a water hose handy if you think it could get out of control. I hate weeds. This would be a good question for home and garden.

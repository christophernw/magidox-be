I dunno! Seriously, we see our own bodies everyday, but our parents try to keep us away from violence, although thats kinda stupid, cuz if they really did not wish to encorage violence, they would not have more than one child...I mean , when was the last time you saw two siblings peacefully living together?Na, just kidding.But the food, the animals one our plates are pure violence.The war is violence.Do they tell their kids about war? About what happens? We should make a movie purly about the terror and horror of war, to fully embody it all, cuz the citizens of Idiot America simply do not seem to have the imaginations to image the horror, the desperation of War.The thing that does naught but make the weapons company rich and kills men women and children and soaks the earth in blood.

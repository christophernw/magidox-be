Listen, Israel fought several wars for their little piece of land, and they won fair and square. Americans and Europeans can respect that. The Palestenians on the other hand never won anything, are constantly pushed around by their own kind, and then they go and blow up innocent women and children as a way to protest being treated like dogs. If the Palestenians want to act like a dog, then we should treat them like a dog. . . Since you seem to be so in touch with them, tell the terrorists to PHUCK OFF! America will defend its friends. Maybe the Palestinians should get better friends.

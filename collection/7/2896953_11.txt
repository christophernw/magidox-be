Cats are not stuck up at all, they know who likes them and who doesn't like them and they stay away from those who don't like them.. People are the ones who are stuck up and think they are better then anyone else.. Cats are the smart ones and when a cat loves someone they will not betray that person like people do.. Apparently you are not a cat person to think cats are stuck up.. Cats are usually a one person cat and that will make some people think cats are stuck up.

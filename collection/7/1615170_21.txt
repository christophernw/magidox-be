Try melotonin -- it's a substance that your body naturally produces (also available in pill form), that helps you fall asleep and stay asleep.  If you exercise, make sure you do so in the morning, not at night.  Check your stress level -- if it's high, try to do some relaxing exercises (yoga or meditation or listening to soft music) before bed.

Because in space all climates are specifically maintained and regulated, plants grow, live, digest food, and gather energy in different ways than they do on earth. Also in space, plants are studied in Zero gravity. Scientists do this to examine the internal forces within a plant to see if gravity negatively or positively affects a plants life cycle.

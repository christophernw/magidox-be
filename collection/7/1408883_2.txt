Of course there is degradation in sound quality compared to uncompressed (wav) files, but it won't be to much for most application. There other compressed audio files are wma, aac, attrac, etc.. iPod is one of portable media player, a portable device to play (some can also record) multi media files. iPod video and iPod Nano, have color screen to view pics, iPod shuffle don't. There also portable player from Sony, Creative, Sandisk, and many others. But by far iPod is the most popular and it has many optional accesories.

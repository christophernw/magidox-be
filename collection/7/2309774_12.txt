being a vet.of two wars i could go into long stories and shed a little light on your so-called "hero's"but,i'd just be wasting my breath.no matter how well you know the people who go to war,they are not the people you know when they are there and you are here.. the truth of the story is we fired blindly and never knew the exact direction of our firing,we never knew how many innocent women and children were killed by our fire.we were told not to let it bother us,we were told all of them were the enemy and we were just killing trash.. does your husband or your brother have trouble sleeping?if they don't,,thats why they deserve to be "dissed".anyone proud of taking another human life reguardless of reason,doesn't deserve to called a human being.human being do not kill.animals kill.but at least animals kill for survival,not for fun or a paycheck.we had no business in iraq.is that your husbands or your brothers fault?no!i am calling them less than human?maybe.am i less than human?yes.am i proud?no!do i still have nightmares?yes.. your husband and brother did what they had to do,i doubt if they are proud of it,if they were forced to kill.but,i imagine they are proud of their country.. you'll have to forgive,i have problems talking about this.i may seem harsh but the wars i fought in were nam/korea.when i go back,my mind clouds.i hope your hus/bro,do not suffer as i have .at least they didn't come to protestors who spit in their faces while carrying signs calling them baby killers.

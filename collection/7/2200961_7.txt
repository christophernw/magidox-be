I don't see people getting angry, but people are concerned.  And they have a right to be.  They are not "angry" just because they voice objections to this film.. . The truth is that if anyone tried to put out a book or film that assaulted Islam, Judaism, gay people, or whatever, there would be a much stronger outcry against it -- and there would be more sympathy for that outcry.  . . Nobody would tell gay people, for instance, to "just relax -- it's just a movie" with regard to a film that portrayed gays in a blatantly false light.

I have tried every repellent made, and they stink, so I don't like them in the house.  What I finally did, was put large decorative rocks in the pots to discourage them.  I have also used foil around the plant - they don't like the noise it makes or the way it crinkles when they paw at it.  I didn't like silver lined plants, so stuck with the rocks

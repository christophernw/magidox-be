the questions raised in this book and the assertions made are based on historical occurrence....the christian bible as it is now existent, was put together at the time of the council of nicea, around 430 CE....it was a put and take operation, some existent books were removed, others obviously retained....this may have been to consolidate the power of a political faction seeking to create and dominate the hierarchy of the church which was politically tied to the empire of Byzantium and the ruler Constantine...if so the book leads to an incomplete view of man's relation to "god"... other areas related to this are that of the Cathar heresy, the Merovingian and the knights Templar...research these and gather your own opinion....remember that your relation to god is YOUR relation to god , not what some other human tells you about god, also check out the research done on the "god spot", an area of the brain which when stimulated brings a mystical experience or "with god" perception...thanks for the possibility to bring up these thoughts....CV

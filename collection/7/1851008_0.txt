I recommend that you read Alice Walker's The Right To Life:  What can the white man say to the black woman'.  You may know alice walker from the colour purple book.  Anyway, althugh the article was written in 1989 and concerns a then current policy issue relating to abortions in america, the article is without doubt one of the best antidotes for racism that i have ever read.. . You can read it at the source below.

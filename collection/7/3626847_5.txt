Usually the "Check Engine" light on most cars comes on when there is a problem with the emissions systems.  I can't give you any better details though because it could be like 300 different things. Go to a mechanic and ask him to run your codes, or buy a code reader, called an OBD Scan Reader. They run from $50-150 at any auto parts store, and can be used over and over again; when you plug it into your car's fuse box, a number comes up on its screen. You get a book with the code reader; simply look up the number and you know what your problem is!

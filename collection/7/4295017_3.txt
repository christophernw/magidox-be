They do sell it in stores.  I got part one from a retaill location.  However, the series was overpriced, and contained too many parts.  Many places stopped carring it after the second one.  In the United States it simply wasnt popular and stores were relecutant to order it because the earlier parts did not sell.  Therefore, only places on the internet have bothered to do so.  You can still find copies in stores that sell used games.

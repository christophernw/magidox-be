Bangalore is, probably, the only city in the world having 9 Municipal Corporation Bodies i.e. Bangalore Mahanagar Palike (BMP), Yelahanka, Byatarayanapura, K. R. Puram, Mahadevpura, Bommanahalli, Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Kengeri and Dasarahalli municipal corporations.. . However, talks are going on now to merge these Municipal Corporations, as there is no coordination between them, and infrastructure, especially in other than BMP is pathetic (not that BMP is world class either, but its better). When, if at all, will this become a reality is to be seen.

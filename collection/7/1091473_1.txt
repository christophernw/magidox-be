I was going to mention putting the alarm clock across the room. you are just a night person that's all. Keep your coffee down to a couple of cups a day and don't have any say after 3pm. You need to keep an a consistant schedule. Go to bed and wake up the same time every day even on the weekends. You need to train your body.

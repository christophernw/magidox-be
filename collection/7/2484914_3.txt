Well, automatically, you no it's not good, and definately not healthy to keep your feelings bottled up inside. When you are angry, frustrated or sad, you need to vent. I would talk to my parents, best friend, pschiatrist or just about anyone who'd listen. If you seek professional help, they will give you anti-depressants to help you deal with your depression. Also try talking to God. He always there to listen no matter what. Just like the good book say, throw all your troubles on him. I would also look into support groups. They also have them on the internet.

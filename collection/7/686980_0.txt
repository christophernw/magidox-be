Golden retriever has longer hair and is a little heavier. Labradors have short hair made for the water and come Black, blond, and brown "Chocolate".  Labs are typicaly more hyper, but also more willing to try and make their owner happy. Both are good dogs if you have the patients to make it through the puppy years.

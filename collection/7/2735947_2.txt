for all intent and purposes, it depends, was it on it's back when found.. in the home... what was it's color... but in the general . sense, when you find a butterfly in the deceased process it means. for all literal purposes, is that it it is dead, no longer amounts the living, failure in it's ability to exist, won't breathe no more, met it's maker, checked out, deeped sixed, been filed to the 13th file, been sent to the round file, smelled it's last buttercup, found it's last dandelion, etc. want to really know what it means e-me.

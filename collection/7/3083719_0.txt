This should never be done without a doctor. I was on risperdol for anxiety attacks and i took myself off and i did have withdraw from it but i was lucky and after about a week it stopped but i only took them 1 time a day and i wasn't on a strong dose either. so be very careful as i think you need to get a doctor involved even if you have to go to a different doctor just to be on the safe side.

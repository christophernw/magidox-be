Could you try the old idea of different types of liquid in a clear glass/plastic tube. Each has a different density, so the heaviest goes to the bottom, the lightest to the top? Cant remember the exact liquids to use, but something dense like oil, then baby oil, water, etc.....the tube can be shaken, but the liquids will always seperate out in layers......

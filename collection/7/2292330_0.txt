In a liquid state, the water molecules are moving around randomly; when water freezes, the molecules form a crystalline lattice structure with definite spacing between molecules.  The average intermolecular spacing in the crystal is larger than the average distance between freely-moving molecules, so the same amount of  matter (same number of molecules) takes up more space in crystal form.

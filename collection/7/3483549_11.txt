Most of the time the databases are not correct or updated properly. . . If everybody decided not to pay, then the police would be overloaded and the system would break down. The "scary bit" is to the cut down the percentage that don't pay or forget to a manageable size.. . The whole system is a farce anyway. Most of the money collected does not go for road improvement. It could be collected more efficiently with the MoT.. . I forgot for three months. No consequences.

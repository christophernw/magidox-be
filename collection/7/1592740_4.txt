Some because they like animals.  They don't like to eat another living breathing creature, that has feelings and often times the raising slaughtering is brutal and inhumane.. . Some because they fear all the things being pumped into the animals (hormones, antiboitics, etc).. . Some because they feel that vegetables, fruits, legumes, etc are a healthy choice because of all the nutrients and other benefits they offer and you can get everything you need for your body from them.. . Some because of their religion says not to.. . Some because of their religion, but not because it says so but because of a personal decision.  Like the Christian Bible doesn't forbid Christians to eat meat.  However some Christians recognize that in the beginning Adam and Eve were supposed to eat off the land, not the animals.  They choose to go veg in order to get closer to what God's orginal plan for man was.. . So there are lots of reasons.

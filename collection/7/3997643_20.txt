Because Israel has the full support of US no matter what...Even if the UN is trying to do something US is going to veto any sanction against them...And even if someone would say anything about what the IDF has done in those six days,they would be called antisemitic...We are constantly reminded of the Holocaust because they think this is going to justify somehow what they are doing in the Palestinians territories...although I really don't know how this can be a justification to the murders Israel is committing against the Palestinians.... Just look at what happened this morning in Beit Hanoun...when the IDF has attacked civilians homes and killed 18 women and children...I really wonder if someone is going to be punished for this...although I doubt it...

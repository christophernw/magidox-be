Things like the Enron swindle are more and more common, and I believe represent the "new age" of fraud.  Whether you look at the prescription drug market, or how to e-mail yourself a college degree, fraud runs rampant in the USA.  I think people just follow along with it, and decide that if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.. . On another note, I just saw a program which showed how Tokyo Rose in WW2 was a complete sham, and they hung a poor Japanese American woman out to dry.  So fraud has been around a long time.  I just think the common man has said, well why should fraud be reserved for governements???

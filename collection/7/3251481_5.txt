what do u want them to do? throw away their dinners and run out in the streets with placards etc, u have to realise that most westerners can do nothing at that particular moment, its those in govt that are supposed to react, or maybe journalist and media men can write up something to try to create more awareness, but in reality its the govt that reacts and not the average westerner eating his dinner. I'm sure if the president see's a headline like that he might discontinue his dinner immediately and call for a senior cabinet meeting

Any time you're reduced to swearing at someone you're being rude.  You could always make your point just as well by saying something else.. . Was he rude?  He was acting out of loving concern if you find that rude I would wonder why.  The thing is listening to their argument causes no pain and you won't be converted unless you see their point.  He would have been rude if you had politely said.  I don't know you and I have a policy of not talking to strangers on the street.  Good luck and have a nice day.  . . There is no bar to new information stronger than a closed mind.

I agree...it is a damn shame when people twist the meaning of "freedom of speech" in order to use it as an excuse to spread hatred and violence.  It is inexcusable.. I would say that such people are suffering from low self esteem.  By convincing themselves that they are somehow "better" than someone who is not like them in some way, they seek to make themselves feel "superior".  It never works.. Like my dear old Granny says, "scratch a bully, and you'll find a coward hiding underneath"!!

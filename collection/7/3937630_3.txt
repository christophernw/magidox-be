Because Traditionally, Witches are portrayed as villians in folk lore and fairytales.  Take any three "Old World" fairytales and you will see what i mean.  This even goes back to the early days of film and particularly animation.  In many of the early Disney movies (based on fairytales) witches are the villians.  This includes "Sleeping Beauty", "Snow White" and even later movies like "Little Mermaid".. . But this stigma (In film) probally goes back to the 1600s and the witch scares in America and England (If you think the Salem Witch Trials were bad you shouls look into what was happening in England).  This was a time that little was known about Wiccan beliefs, and the Holier then thou mindframe of the time.  It was believed at the time (and some believe now) that witches were in leauge with the devil.. . And people seem to forget that "The Wizard of Oz" features the most beloved witch of all time... Galinda.  (I might have spelled it wrong)

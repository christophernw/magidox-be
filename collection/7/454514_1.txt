Howdy! :). . Actually, you can't! I don't enough about quantum physics & mechanics to tell you if the concept of "electical charge" applies to "sub-sub" atomic particles as well, such as quarks. What I can tell you is that you can't understand "electrical charge" independent of atoms, as they are inextricably linked.. . Essentially, when an electron goes from 1 level in an atom to another, that shift in energy levels constitutes an electrical charge.. . I would expound more on the subject. But I consider myself too ignorant to do it justice. Check Encarta's & Wikipedia's articles on the subject(http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566543_1____2/Electricity.html#s2 & http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge & http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity) . They're very good & very helpful! Good luck! :) Take very good care & have yourself a most joyous day, every day.. . Love And Light. Cogano

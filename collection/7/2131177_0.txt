Scales are expensive. The scoop is roughly what you need. . . A more simple answer is that one 'heaping' table spoon is about five grams. I believe the scoop that comes with it is equivalent to a heaping tablespoon too. . So - one heaping table spoon.. . (heaping table spoon is a spoon full that has a mound on top, the most possible the spoon will hold). . It will also weigh the same weight as 15 paperclips.

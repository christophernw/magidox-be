a redneck is kinda like a way of life, its a mentality, kinda like a homie or vato.....ya we where tight jeans, listen to merle haggard, and drink alot of beer, but it doesnt mean we are uneducated, or backwood people....just like a homie or vato doesnt imply ghetto hood rats or a boarder jumper....

Bad news. You are what you are and the way you will be........You can get therapy every day and it won't help. You can change for the period of time that you are thinking about it and trying to change, but you will go back to the same personality.. . It is a brain chemistry thing. That's why people go on drugs. You could stay on the drugs forever, I guess. But when you go off them, there you are again......Just you and that old original personality....Humans are not like soaps and cleaner items that boast, "NEW AND IMPROVED". Just doesn't happen for us.

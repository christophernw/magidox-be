Ask them.  Write a letter or go in person.  When I adopted my daughter from Brazil years ago, I went to various stores to get supplies for the orphanage (toothbrushes, toothpaste, band-aids, diapers, etc.).  Most did not give outright, but they gave a hefty discount!  Even if you can't get donations, discounts would probably help -- and you might get outright gifts, esp. if you offer to put a Christmas note with a list of donors in the box.  The stores see it as publicity and you see it as free donations.  :-)

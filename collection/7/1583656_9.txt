well i think it does depend on the area and the people in the street. rich people often keep to themselves and have a small circle of friends whereas poor families rely on each other for security as wel as small things, i live in a very stereo typical street where our neighbnours are always over borrowing sugar and flour and onions. but yes, often in cities life is simply too busy to get to know the neighbours

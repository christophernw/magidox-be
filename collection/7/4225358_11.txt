Hey, my trainer gave me this one and it worked for his dog and mine. You hide and watch (lay in wait) where the dog can not see you. When the dog starts to dig jump out with a coke can full of nichols (taped over the opening) and shake the can along with verbal admonishments. A few times and the dog associates the behavior with something unpleasant and cuts out the digging.

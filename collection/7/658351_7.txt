What does Kelsey have to do with it?  ; ). . I think people use poor grammar because they forget what they've been taught in school, or they just don't practice.. . Maybe it's just not "cool." (shakes head) I've seen numerous poorly-worded and spelled posts here in "Answers," and many out on message boards, etc. by people who claim they're not going to worry about it, so intentional negligence is also a factor, and that's the most disturbing. Why willfully ignore your education? I've never understood how people decide when they're going to use what they know and when they're going to ignore it. Do they have a daily checklist of scenarios?. . I'm not a perfect grammarian myself, but I try to remember what I've been taught. I'm sure someone could pick apart my response here and find something, but my errors (hopefully) aren't egregious.

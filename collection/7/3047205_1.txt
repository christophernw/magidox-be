If you aren't a terrorist, then what are you worried about? I don't have a problem with it at all. Furthermore, I think the media makes mountains out of molehills and stirs up more trouble for us (and aids the terrorists) by trying to expose too much information.  These things are called "Secret" for a reason. If We The People know about things you can bet your butt that the terrorists know even more about it that we do.. . Get a life regarding the girlfriend comment.  I don't understand how one can be so ignorant as to compare terrorists and some lame girlfriend relationship in the same sentence!  GEEEZ!. . The media blabs too much information!

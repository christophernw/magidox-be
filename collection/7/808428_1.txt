it was very special. i had the mass ceremony with natural beautiful flowers everywhere. then i had a comida before the dance. the dance hall was huge, i had about 500 people there. oh and the musicos were cali carranza. do you know them? and of course theres the dance with your dad. its was a special moment for me and i hope for you too. its like going from a little girl to a young woman!

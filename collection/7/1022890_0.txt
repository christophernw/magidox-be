Technically speaking, bird flu has been around for a very long time in aquatic bird species, says Dr. Richard Webby, Ph.D., assistant member, Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The precursor virus of the current H5N1 outbreak was first seen in geese in China in 1996. The virus has continued to circulate in the region and has changed considerably since this time both in terms of its genetic composition and, as importantly, its geographic range.

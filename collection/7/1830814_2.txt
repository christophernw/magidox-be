Air friction in the Earth's atmosphere causes them to burn up. It is simmilar to rubbing hads together. The "motion energy" gets converted to heat energy. The same concept applies to the meteors. When a meteoroid enters the atmosphere, the great speed converts the energy of it's motion to heat energy, which burns it up.

what me and my freinds did is (we were only allowed 3 pieces of paper and 1 meter of masking tape) tape a sheet of paper around the egg, make straps out of the left over masking tape, attach it to the egg and attach the other end to two pieces of paper taped together as a parachute. we won, ours dropped from 30 feet without breaking!

Couples might go into counseling secretly thinking the counselor will point out that your partner is at fault and if he (or she) . changes, then all will be well! . But...you eventually come to realize that there is no one you CAN change but yourself. . . So, maybe you find new a way to go on together as a couple (if the old ways are not working) . Or maybe you just learn to know yourself much better, and that is the benefit.

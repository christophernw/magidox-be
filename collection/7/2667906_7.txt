Why draw such outrageous assumptions?, not even the best scientist knows all there is to be known, and until they do, only a fool could arrive at those assumptions.. I have seen nothing in science that disproves the existence of God, but I've seen plenty of evidence for the creation argument!. Albert Einstein, one who's intelligence has never been doubted, and Bertrand Russell (much celebrated atheist), issued a statement two days before Einstein died, they said this ..."Those of us who know the most  are the gloomiest about the future" ...why is that, if these guy had all the answers???

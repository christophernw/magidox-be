You cannot train a cat to go outside.  If they do go outside they may eliminate waste out there and since all cats should be in after dark she would still need one for her in the house.  The kitten will need his own box.  Remember the litterbox rule:  # of cat, + 1.. . The litterbox should not be smelly if you keep it clean for her.  If you feed cheap food with a lot of corn you will have smelly poops for sure.

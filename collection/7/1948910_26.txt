When I was little I would tell my mom and she would say "Do you really... if you really do then hiccup for me...". I would try so hard for a couple of minutes while she watched patiently... but I never could hiccup. I'd go away and they'd be gone. Being 21 now I see the logic behind it. When I get the hiccups now, all I have to do is try to hiccup. It never has let me down.

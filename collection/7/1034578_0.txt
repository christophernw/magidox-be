Mablean Ephriam, who until recently presided over the syndicated television show 'Divorce Court," says that she was given her walking papers from the show, in part because FOX would not cut her slack when it came to styling her hair. "...When will FOX and the rest of America accept our cultural differences as African Americans and embrace us with all of our different hairstyles, hair textures, hair color..." she said in a "press conference statement.". FOX gave Mablean the boot after seven years because they say Mablean was asking for a lot more money than the network was willing to shell out. TMZ is told two million a year was not enough for Mablean, so FOX said farewell.

Ignoring poor behavior only works for children, and that's even iffy.  When your dog misbehaves, discipline immediately.  Dogs are naturally eager to please their owners.  A roll of newspaper or a specific time out spot, like a kennel was always effective for me.  You have to let the dog know you are serious, do not apologize for the discipline and definitely use the word NO when teaching what not to do.

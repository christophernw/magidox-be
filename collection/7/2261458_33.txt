i'm very sorry about your bird. its hard for me to tell you what you should do, maybe you'd love another bird, but maybe another bird wouldnt be the same.. . maybe try a different animal? we have a marginated tortoise. they can live to be upwards of 60 years old, they're super easy to take care of, they're clean, all the things they eat are available at the grocery store, and they're not that expensive to get into. all together, i think we spent $300 for the table, lights, tortoise, and other random turtle stuff.

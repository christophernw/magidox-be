Used to work in the corporate retail world...you're going to have to contact Mervyn's corp which is in Pleasanton, CA (bay area) and speak with them.  Corporate is the one that determines what the stores sell and the set up of the stores...etc.  Going to the store directly will not do anything because they don't have the authority to say yes or no in terms of carrying your product.  Mervyn's is also Target Corp.  One thing that u might want to think about too is that you're prob going to have to be able to provide enough quantity to all Mervyn's stores if you want them to carry your products.

Because people have both good and bad hiding in the heart. It takes no effort to be bad. People need to realize that if you take a white man and put him in a black body, he will still be that same man but in a different skin color. He all of a sudden does not become de-valued just because he is suddenly black. He is the same person. So when we look at a black person (or red or white or yellow or brown, etc.) acknowledge that he is a valuable person inside those bodies, just like us.

back in the day...we used lard...  but now times have changed...it isn't really the food, as in any culture..it the way it is prepared. I have put a stop to the lard..and went for olive oil...food even taste different...but everyone knows butter and lard gives it's flavor...as for a sub...just watch the salt and oil...other than that...the only health risk i can think of...is your body getting tired from all that "junk in the trunk"

She may have swallowed something that hasn't  gone all the way down or if in contact with other dogs have kennel cough which can last 21 days or a lung or a heart problem -hard to tell without a Vet check which it is.  The Kennel cough is the least dangerous and although annoying to the dog and owner hrdly ever fatal-the dog does not show signs of being sick.  Did a quick search on coughing and hacking in dogs.  if afater 2-3 weeks the dog is still coughing or he shows signs of being ill sooner stops eating, isn't as active as usually then you must take to a vet or it will get very serious and be more costly-have your dog checked and then after arrange a payment plan---just to have him checked should not be much but if the vet thinks serious may involve blood work or X-Ray but only and stress to Vet low on money for then will not do unnecessary tests as routine.

I think that is a hard issue. I don't think we can ever eliminate prejudice as we all naturally do that when we meet someone. We tend to prejudge based on looks/dress/manner. Our country is so ingrained with racism, it's hard to just "get over it".But one idea is for people to be more multicultural and learn more about other races/cultures/religions so as to not be ignorant.

This is a bit out of my area of experience, but I think I can help you out. . . As you probably know, truffles are fungi that grow in the soil. Truffles, in particular, are mycorrhizae. This is a type of fungi that forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of plants. The fungi gets carbohydrates from the tree while helping the roots gather the nutrients they need from the soil. Unlike mushrooms, which have been cultivated successfully, truffles depend on this relationship to get energy and grow. This is a very complex environment to duplicate. . . "Truffles" the fungi (Tuber melanosporum, Tuber aestivum, et al.) should not be confused with "truffles" the chocolate candy or "Truffles" the dog, whose web page I found while looking for information. . . A number of things combine to make truffles very expensive:. . . Truffles are rare and difficult to find. Certain animals, such as pigs and squirrels, like truffles just as much as we do, putting us in competition with nature to gather them first. . Truffles are a seasonal crop that can only be harvested for a short period each year. . Fresh truffles can only be stored for a few weeks before loosing quality. . There are very limited places in the world (mostly in Europe) that are renowned for producing the "best" crops. Many of these areas have been destroyed by development and environmental damage. . I have heard of attempts to cultivate or even grow truffles synthetically. From a culinary perspective, the resulting truffles have no taste and poor texture making them, in a word, worthless.

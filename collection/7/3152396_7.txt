because the shell is formed by the animals ribs which have expanded outward and fused together. i didn't believe it at first when my diversity teacher told me but i recalled a turtle shell i had as a child and when you looked inside the vertebral column was fused to the top of the shell which makes sense when you consider the rib expansion factor.

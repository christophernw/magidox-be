A spear is a weapon. It is a long shaft with a sharpened point or head (similar to an arrow) for the purpose of killing fish, animals and humans. It can be thrown or used in a thrusting motion to effect multiple wounds.. . A javelin is used in the sport known as "The Javelin Throw" or as part of mixed events ("The Decathlon"). It also has a long shaft, but the point is actually quite blunt in comparison and is intended to burrow into the ground and remain there. Points are scored for furthest throw.

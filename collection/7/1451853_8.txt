I found the Pope's speech on the Vatican's website: http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1985/july/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19850706_conferenza-cosmologia_en.html. . From what I can read, the Pope did not tell the scientists not to study the origin of the universe.. . He said that he believed that science could not discover everything. That "certain aspects of our lives rise above and move beyond the material dimension and, while having deep roots in the material, surpass the understanding which the natural sciences are capable of providing.". . With love in Christ.

Because of sin, we don't all have the same level of maturity. . . Because we believe in freedom of conscience and so we cannot force others to believe what we believe. . . Because it's the only way to be productive as a local body, meaning, we agree to disagree and go our separate ways. We couldn't work as one with divisions among us.. . Our differences are real and unfortunate, however, we acknowledge each other as brothers and sisters. And we have much more in common than unbelievers realize. We hold as one the belief in one God and His Son who died for us all and one day will return for us all, Baptists, Presbyterian, Lutherans and others.

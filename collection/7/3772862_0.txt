It's just a common belief, carrying extra weight puts an added strain on your body and of course there are many obese/fat people who do little exercise and eat all the wrong foods all the time.. . The stereotype is a fat person taking no exercise and eating fatty/junk food all day washed down with gallons of soda. The fact that some may be large boned, have an illness or do lots of physical activity just doesn't enter their minds.. . Until the majority of people understand that you can be large and still be active or that some people have medical imbalances a fat person will always be seen as a slob, a glutton & one incapable of being active due to their size

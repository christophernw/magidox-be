I just turned 15 1/2 and I just started to get my permit, and here's what I have to do (I live in CA, so it might be a bit different). You can go to an online drivers ed program that costs about $60 and complete the course, then go to your local DMV and take a test that if you pass you get your permit. Or you can enroll in a class that is over a weekend and then take the test after the class. Once you have your permit you have to have it for 6 months before you can get your license.

Well, let's think about this.  Liberals are constantly criticizing the war.  Good things are happening in Iraq...but the media doesn't report it?  Huh?  The liberal-controlled media doesn't want to report anything positive out of Iraq.  Why would they?  They find it better to strike fear and hatred into the hearts of Americans rather than pride and security.

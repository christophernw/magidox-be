We got a cat and just sneaked him in.  We then (months later) sprung the news on our estate agent.  We told him one of us got the cat as a present. He was OK with it.. It might, of course, be risky to do that, especially that dogs cannot be "hidden" inside but then again, it could work (provided estat office is not near your flat).  I don't think there's anything else you can do, other than getting your own place.

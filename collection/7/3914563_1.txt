Go to the doctor!  Strep can be very dangerous.  . . One thing I do to prevent it in dry weather is to use a humdifier in the house.  I also take my vitamins, eat right, drink water, and sleep well.  Your body will fight germs better if your body is healthy generally.. . But get in to see a doctor very soon.  Strep or any bacteria infection in your throat is nothing to mess with.

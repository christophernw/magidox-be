It would seem that the clutch to the cooling fan isn't disengaging, causing the engine to work more than necessary, or it could be the electric fan for your A/C is on allot due to having your defroster on, or could be the radiator has something blocking its airflow, maybe causing the engine to overheat(or close to it) causing your idling problems.

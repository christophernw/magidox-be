umm... i believe it's LOVE that moves in mysterious ways. God, meanwhile, WORKS in mysterious ways. . . well, it may seem mysterious to us, but it's not. He has everything planned out for us, and even though the twists our life takes may seem weird, they're all just going to bring you closer to the fulfillment of that plan.. . read the bible. it has all the answers. or join some helpful religious group or something.. . really.

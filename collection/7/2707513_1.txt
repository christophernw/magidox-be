One broad stroke - women try to figure ulterior motives in men's behavior, when there are only 3 or 4 functions for men:. 1. Eat. 2. Have sex. 3. Watch sports. 4. Sleep. . On a more serious level,. Women tend to have more of a social network (Sex in the City, the Special K Commercial of the woman in red joining three friends for breakfast, the Lean Cuisine commercials are some of medias portrayal).  You rarely see a group of guys getting together for breakfast unless it's a business or civic event.  (The Hardee's commercial of men trying to make breakfast with the liner "Some guys would starve." is another media portrayal.). . Men are stupid dogs (and you can say it takes one to know one). Even after being in a monogamous relationship for 9 years, I threw it away because I got lonely, and craved some companionship.. . I think there would be less war if women were in power, as men are territorial, and think nothing of throwing a punch if they feel threatened (and men in power, that punch is bombs).. . I don't agree with the view that men are not able to multi-task, as I have to do that in my work daily.  Maybe it could be viewed as such if you review what I said at the beginning, though.. . Hope this gives some insight.

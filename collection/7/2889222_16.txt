You need to give him something to chew on, he may be bored. Pop his nose whenever he bites, push him down and hold him,. .  when he bites,  say a firm "NO" then put him in a practically empty room without any toys or or anything to play with, for 5 or 10 minutes. Continuosly do this EVERY time he bites and NEVER give in or he'll think he can get anything he wants.

well, I can't answer your question entirely (as I'm too lazy to look the same information up for myself). However, I recommend that you contact Ed Trice (the inventor of the Gothic Chess variant) at the following e-mail (gothichessinfo@aol.com). You may be able to find out some of what you'd like to know from him.

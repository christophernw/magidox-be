ideally, if you live in a subdivision with active sales, the appraiser looks for at least 3 sales within the last 6 months.  Hopefully these sales would be similar to the subject property.  Other factors are acreage, construction materials, inground pool, etc.  Others might be fencing, decks, patios, or screened in, or front porches.  If you do not live in a s/d then the appraiser is usually allowed a 1 mile radius, as well as 12 months to look for sales.

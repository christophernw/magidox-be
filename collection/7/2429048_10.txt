Just do it.. . Cut out the fast food joints, or have the salads, get rid of all the junk food in your house and replace it with fruits and veggies.. . It's hard, but you can treat yourself with the mini candy bars or the occasional big mac.. . You don't have to cut out the junk completely, just balance it with better foods.

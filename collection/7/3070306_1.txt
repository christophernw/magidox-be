If they accept fin. aid, they are probably accredited. If they don't, they are not..With most online colleges, you can do it in less than 4 years.  Depends on the college..BE SURE THEY ARE accredited..They all have accreditation but I went to one and needed 3 classes for my bachelors only to find out I would have to move to OHIO to use it..Also know that if you might plan on attending an offline school, the classes you took may not transfer.

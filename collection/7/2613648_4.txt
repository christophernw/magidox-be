The thing that works the best to help strengthen your eyes is reading. The more you use your eyes to track (follow) the lines of words, the better the muscle strength. If you mean strengthen them so you don't need glasses, that isn't really possible, you can't force your eyes to work better than they do. If you keep trying you will only weaken them more in the long run (meaning: need a stronger prescription pair of glasses).

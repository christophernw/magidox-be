they ran a moderate democrat campaign to bring in the votes.  "look we are not extremists we are moderates so vote for us"  she was thinking this would give her the majority then she could ram through the extreame leftist agendas through leadership.  She figured the newly appointed would side with her to vote party lines and show appreaciation and support for the elders but it backfired.  They saw threw her scheme and told her that they were sticking too their beliefs.  Kudos to the moderates.

Any chance you are preganant? If not that, could be that you just have some water gain sitting on the stomach . If you started eating a healthier diet lately it could also cause some bloating in the stomach/abdominal area. And are you really gaining weight or are you just getting  belly fat? Causes would be different depending on that answer..

You got me.. . I wouldn't say that being a poor speller was a requirement to being in the sciences, though. Most of the doctors I know express themselves accurately. Sometimes you can even read their handwriting. ;) It's just that they don't have the time to look everything up and verify the spelling of every word. So it's not that it is just plain carelessness.  I think they depend on the medical transcriptionists for the exact spelling of the words.. . --fwiw--for what it's worth--sometimes you hear stories like Einstein couldn't tie his own shoelaces or something like that--don't know if it's true, but it makes you think--

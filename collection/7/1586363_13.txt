women don't wear burkas or scarfves inside the house...just in public. they wear a scarf on the head and a thin cotton usually jacket type garment outside. has to atleast come up to the knees. They wear it to respect themselves. A guy would most likely flirt and disrespect a girl wearing a tight tank top and a mini skirt rather than a girl wear jeans and a long loose top and a head scarf. You save your beauty, not display it for all the pervs who don't deserve it. . and about the polos or pink t shirt. They do have those clothes. I wear a shirt and jeans everyday. You just wear your outer garment over it with a scarf.

Two vertical channels attached between the floor and the ceiling or maybe even attach them to the desks to keep the panel from swinging as it goes up and down.  Then run a cable from the panel to a (120V) electric winch.  The winch can be located straight above the panel or if you locate a pully above the panel, the winch can be located further away.  . . An alternative to the winch would be to purchase a inexpensive garage door opener.  They already have the mechanical features which shut the motor off when the panel is all the way up or down.   They even come packaged with 2 wireless remote controls... you just put one on each desk.

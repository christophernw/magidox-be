what is "emo"? What do you mean you cut yourself?. . I found "emo", It short (laziness) for emotional.. . Honey, I just looked at your other questions.  You need to seriously talk to someone, a counselor, anybody.  If you;re legit, you need help, NOW.. . Ahh.  You're aggravating me because I don't know if you are sincere or not.  If so, cutting yourself is stupid. And the way you asked about that makes me think your fake. True cutters don't show other people.  It's not something you take pride in.  Do you know why people cut?  Why do you cut?

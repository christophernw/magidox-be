Why do you have to be religious? Is it the social aspect? Life is soo much better knowing that all religions are just  mythical human creations a modern mind can do quite well without since nature is really all there is and the study of natural sciences is the closest we will ever get to really knowing and being enlightened - not by any external gods but the use, development and enjoyment of your own mind and all the intelligence you can find in nature all around you.. . Francesco di Vienna. ___________________

Since the government controls the internet in China, Yahoo (& Google) block those sites so they can still get traffic from China - since China has the largest population, they feel it is too much of a risk to be COMPLETELY blocked. So, they block a few sites, they continue getting those important "hits" to their web counters, the Chinese government censors "subversive" material and the only loser is the Chinese web surfer.

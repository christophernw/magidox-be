Great question! How about this:. . Suppose you were wearing blue lenses. Everything you'd see would look bluish! Now, someone asks you: what color is this apple. You say "blue!" WOW! You are NOT a good source of answers about colors while you are wearing those blue lenses. . . Likewise, you are not a good source of answers on your own self-worth right now. Someone evidently convinced you, years ago, you were not a worthwhile person. So you are not a good source of information about YOU right now. Your glasses are too "blue.". . Find someone whose opinion you respect. Ask them for an assessment of what is good about you and what needs tuning up. They will tell you. Inventory the good things you do for someone else, like your girlfriend, your sister, brother, a friend. Ask them what they like about you.. . Then when something makes you think "Boy! I'm crap" you then take the next thought which is "My friend X says I am nice to my sister and brother, I listen well and try to help and I work really hard. So I AM a good person. I guess my glasses are just too "blue" right now. ". . Then you need to find something to do to help other people. Join a charity, volunteer, make yourself useful to someone else. The realization that you are a good, decent person who people care about will be self-evident after a while when you look at the good things you accomplish. And focusing on others who need your help will keep you from dwelling on your own fears.

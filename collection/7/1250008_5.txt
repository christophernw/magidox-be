Daer god don't go to petsmart!  Work with her in the house at first then out side gradualy.  Put her in a sit/stay, then walk away, when your ready call her (name) come!!  in a happy voice and pat your leggs, make it exciting to come to you.  Once she gets this down, be a little more strict about it.  If she doesn't come right away when you call her to you, go over to her and get her collar and give several short but firm tugs, all the way back to where you first called her to you, saying come! every time you tug.  Never give the come command if you can't enforce it!  send me a message if you want more pointers or need more details.

I suppose because you are not honest enough to say to your family/friends 'I dont believe in God/Jesus so I do not want to celebrate Christmas. Please don't buy me presents or invite me to parties or get-togethers'. . You are not the only one!. . PS You can not believe in God if you want to, but doesnt mean that HE doesnt believe in you! Also you have to believe in Jesus - He is def a historical figure, BUT whether you believe He was the Son of God is up to you.

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium leprae which causes disfiguration of the body or skin. The bacterium is an aerobic, acid fast, rod-shaped (bacillus) mycobacterium. The modern term for the disease is named after the discoverer of the bacterium, Gerhard Armauer Hansen.

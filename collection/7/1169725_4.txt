Ringworm is an infection caused by a fungus that grows on the skin.  You can get over-the-counter antifungal cream or ointment at your local pharmacy.  Your rash may start to clear up soon after you begin treatment, but it is important to use the medicine exactly as the label so it won't come back.  (Usually 2 to 4 weeks).. . If it doesn't get better or if the tinea (fungal infection) is widespread go see the doctor.  He/She will prescribe an oral medication to help you get rid of it.  If you don't treat ringworm properly, your skin may crack or blister and get infected.  Then you will need an antibiotic.  So fix it before it becomes a big problem.  . . I hope this helps.

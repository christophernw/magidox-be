If any of you can think for a moment, It is nonsensical to think that man just appeared, by teh power of God or not.. Some Bishops actually have agreed to the fact that evolution is a very good and prominiate answer.. Just think about it.. All the creatures on this planet have 2 eyes, 2 ears, and all mammals have 5 limbs (The tail, and yes humans do have a very very small tail).. Im 15 and i know this much. Jesus people, do some research.. . But to answer your question. . they evolved from a series of bones around the lower jaw that reptiles use to hear. They later evolved into the inner ear bones in mammals right after the Permian age.. . I think the Human Eye, or Eye of any creature is much more confusing... Good Luck :)

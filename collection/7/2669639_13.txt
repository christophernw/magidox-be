If I believed in the death penalty, then it's fair.  But I don't. & just think, once it's over, it's over. Wouldn't it be better to stick him somewhere that he'd have to live with himself for the rest of his life? THAT would really be punishment! I'm sure there are a lot of people who would just love to WATCH him hang. Por que? Emotional satisfaction? Like the old hangings "in the square" where people brought picnic lunches. Make him suffer. Killing him will not do that.

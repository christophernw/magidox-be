oh boy, . Listen I do not know if your Jewish or not but let me give you REAL Jewish perspective. First and for most  one must strive to perfect themselves as a person by learning never to get angry, treating everyone with kindness, always looking to help your fellow man so on and so forth. All the stuff you see with Madonna and kabbalah is garbage. A little read string around your arm is not going to ward away “evil spirtits” if you curse get drunk and dress like a whore. All a real kabbalsists learned to prefect themselves and study the torah first then and only then did they understand and were able to manipulate the forces they were dealing with. In kabbalah as well as Judaism there are no short cuts learn to walk like everyone else before you try and run.

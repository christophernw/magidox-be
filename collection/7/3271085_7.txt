personally would prefer to send eternity here on Turtle Island in the period of time before the European " invaders " came over. but as you said we do not know what will happen when we leave this plane of existence for another. my dad always said he didn't fear death as there was a mystery and only when one left this plane of existence would the mystery be solved.

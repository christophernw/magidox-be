voluntering the information is best, as long as it wasn't a serious misdemeanor or felony u should be ok, also are you over 18? once you age out of the juvenile system and your probabtion is over your record for that time is sealed, since you weren't actually a criminal but a delinquent. your best bet is to talk to your recruiter if he/she is someone you are comfortable with, they will work with you to get you in.

Well, as others have indicated, you must be a worthy member of the church. You may enter any of our chapels, genealogical libraries, stake centers, etc. The Temple, however, is a more sacred place of worship and therefore, reserved for those who are living their lives in a way to be spiritual prepared to enter therein. It is not a new practice as anciently only certain people were allowed into the temple, into the Holy of Holies, or to handle the Ark of Covenant. If the Church allowed anyone and everyone to enter despite worthiness, beliefs, intentions, etc., it would no longer be a sacred, holy Temple.

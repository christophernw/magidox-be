we cant be blamed for whats happening to people who are starving and dieing. these things are natural, it happens to animals and humans are not exception from this struggle. . i don't think we are ignoring the global issue. countries have come together to tackle this problem. but the problem is that we are so used to producing these gases that it would take time to put an end to it.. if you want to make a change start with your self. take the public transport when going to work. don't waste alot of energy such as gas, electricity...etc

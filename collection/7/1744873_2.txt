Sorry to hear about your troubles. I am neither a Dr or a social worker, but I know that schizophrenia often manifests itself to those in their late teens-early 20's. It is a disease that takes people in the spring time of their life and renders them unable to continue on their usual life course. If your social worker assures you that you are not schizophrenic, I would take her word for it. She would have no reason to lie. However, your psychiatrist may order some tests to come up with a diagnosis. And you may need one type of medication or another as prescribed by your Dr. One thing I've observed about schizophrenics, is that just like alcoholics  (and I'm not comparing them) they are often in denial that they have the disease, to the point of evading treatment and refusing meds. It sounds to me like anxiety and low self-esteem ( ?)  are real problems for you. With help, some of us have been able to achieve victory over  these issues.  So called "paranoia" too can be connected with feeling not so good about yourself, so this will lead you to believe that others are looking down on you or have it in for you. You are young  and your whole life is in front of you. I very much hope you find the help that you need., because it is available.  Don't ever give up. I've been there and I know. Good luck and God bless!

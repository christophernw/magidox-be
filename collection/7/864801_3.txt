It depends on the fish and the grill.  Firm fish like Salmon, Red Snapper, Swordfish, Catfish-can go directly on a grill even charcoal.  I leave the skin on until after cooking to help it hold together.  The pieces should be relatively thick and even.  But light, flaky whitefish like Tilapia or Orange Roughy needs to be cooked in something on an outdoor grill but will do okay on a indoor grill like a George Foreman.  Foil kind of defeats the purpose, you don't get the grilled flavor.  There are basket accessories for grilling fish that have flat metal bottoms with very small holes so the fish stays intact but you still get the flavor.

The History Channel did a show about Hitlers lost manuscripts which revealed Hitlers goal to take over America who he thought had the best "Gene's" (Social Darwinism).  . . Hitler coveted the American's who traveled across the sea's to forien lands because this proved they had adventour and they they were superiorly stronger.  . . Ironically, going by this "Social Darwinism" Afro-AMERICANS (not Black people, but AFRO-AMERICANS) are "Socially" the strongest because on the slave drives, they had to endure 10 times more survival skills to be shipped to America.  Historically, many slaves were treated well, but the slavery also enhanced the "Afro-American's" genetics.  . . I guess Hilter was the ultimate manipulator. He manipulated Christianity to only pick what he LIKED in the religion.  He only focused on "Social Darwinism" to the point where his desires showed through.. . I'm glad that the Christians, Atheisists, Jewish, & other religions decided to go to war against this S.O.B. and kick butt!!!  UNITED WE STAND. (sadly, even with the supremacists). . If you've ever been to Germany ... you'd understand that most of them are diverse, and a great culture.. . In my opinion, racism is thickest in China and Japan.  It seems that these cultures are the most secluded and not open to social growth.

I read an article about this in the Washington Post once (link below), and basically they are so expensive because there is high demand for them and they are limited in number.  They were probably cheaper 15 years ago because there were more medallions in circulation compared to the number of people who wanted them.  It also depends on how many new medallions a city may choose to issue and how often.  Read the article for more info.

America is made up of minorities its the illegal thing and having our borders protected and for economic reasons. . what are we supposed to bear the brunt of a whole nation besides us?. have been going off about this problem for years and it has grown in to the ugly scene we see today and even if you make them legal this problem will still be here. you cant just take the brunt of a whole nation and expect no ramification's you cant expect no economic or social ramification's. to say otherwise would be idiotic !WHO will pay for these millions of illegals on welfare when there are NO REAL DECENT JOBS left for anyone here to support a family? If the Mexicans kill off the current working class, then WHO will support THEM? Let's not forget the auto parts plant moved from Detroit to Mexico just a few years ago, that was then moved back to Detroit about a year later. Why? Because after 12 noon they did almost no work. Several auto production lines were in danger of shutdown because sub-assembly parts were late. Is this the future of America?. . In time, that reality will manifest itself in America as the middle class vanishes. It' already happening!

As most answerer's have pointed-out, reaching an understanding is not very likely.. . Why? Because "proving" one religion is better than another is almost impossible.. . For example, even if Jesus came back, there would still be some who wouldn't believe he was who he claimed to be!  . . After all, he was crucified his first visit!. . You think that may be why he hasn't come back? :-). . Moreover, there is disagreement even among Christian sects (Catholics, Baptists, Presbyterians, and so on), about how your life should be lived.  So even among his followers, there is, and most likely always will be, disagreements.. . And we haven't even mentioned the Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and others.. . Moreover, I imagine that God wants it that way!  I believe he practices "free speech", and he doesn't bar anyone's beliefs in how to live - until, and this is the key here, until (1) they claim theirs is the only true religion, and (2)they  harm others.. . So to achieve the goals of your question, we must work to allow anyone to worship any god they choose, and respect that decision, unless the two rules above are violated.. . I believe that's what god wants! . . But you pose a good question, and I hope you find a way to help achieve the premise!

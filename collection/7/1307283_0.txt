That sharp pain is actually a weak electric shock! If you have a filling and bite on another kind of metal such as tinfoil, your slightly acid saliva turns your mouth into an electricity-producing battery. The electric current passes through the filling right into the sensitive nerve of your tooth.  Pretty cool huh?

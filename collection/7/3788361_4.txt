It may not be a question of whether you are grooming him/her enough.. . Is this your first dog, puppy, adult or elderly? dog or bitc*? what breed?. . Some breeds, like labs, tend to shed continuosly whether brushed daily or not. Others have thick undercoats that come out in convenient clumps when you groom. Some breeds shed all year in centrally heated properties and some produce upwards of 3 bin bags worth twice a year.. . The only way to cut down on shedding has already been suggested, by grooming daily but if its in the breeds genetics to shed like that nothing you do will make a difference. (Still groom it daily anyway, its fun for you and the dog :). . Have you already got this dog or is it something you want to know before you get one? If you dont have one yet consider a Poodle or Bichon Frise, they need regular trips to the groomers for clipping (not shaving all over!) but do not shed anything more than the occassional hair that gets tugged during everyday activities. There are a couple of other breeds that do not shed but I cant recall them right now. A good breed encyclopedia will have all the info you need.. . Good luck to you :) Oh, and invest in a Dyson vaccuum ;)

I would suggest thinking of a service that you can do. Advertise this service on local craigslist or put ads up at the market or library or let others know through word of mouth. You can grow this business as small or as large as you want. It could be some thing local or you could buy items and resell them on ebay for example. Use your imagination. When I needed to save for college in the mid 70s, I raised and sold the offspring of many pairs of cockatiels to pay for my degrees. Good luck.

if you're in a big office, just try and go when there's no one else in the loo, and if someone comes in, just hide in the loo til they've gone so no one will know its you.  in a small office, there'd nothing you can do, they'll all know that big smelly turd was yours.  just go at lunchtime in a shop or go straight after someone else to reduce the likelihood of anyone walking in on you

Both grilling and barbeque are done outside, over an open flame with the fire or smoke touching the meat. If it is done on a flat surface like a pan, then by that logic your pancakes would be "grilled", and so would Chinease stirfry. . . grilling is high heat for a short time. Barbeque is low heat for a very long time, WHILE IT IS EXPOSED TO SMOKE! Barbeque cannot, I repeat CANNOT involve barbeque sause. You usually apply a dry rub though consisting of things such as salt, pepper, chili powder, or whatever else you want. Some people use a "mop" on barbeque that will include ingredients like beer, cider, vinegar. But never anything that has tomato or sugar, because it will burn.. My phylosophy on barbeque sause is that it is a condiment served on the side to complement the smoky flavors of the meat, not to provide the flavor for the meat.. . Grilling usually involves the more tender cuts of meat like the steak (think tenderloin). Barbeque was meant as a way of cooking the tough or large cuts of meat like ribs or brisket. You can tell if something is barbequed when it has a smoke ring, a pink ring around the area of the meat exposed to the smoke.

don't be too self-conscious.you might think you are gaining weight because when you exercise,you burn your fats then you tone your muscles.it might be the reason that you think you are becoming heavier than you think you are.set a goal,sometimes when we look in the mirror,we tend to be conscious about our body,but the truth is,we look just fine.

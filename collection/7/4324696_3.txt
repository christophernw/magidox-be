Religion is the ultimate con, it is government protected, tax free and the product they sell doesn't have to be delivered until you reach a place that doesn't exist. No wonder so many people jump on this manured money wagon. Unfortunately, there is a flaw in the Constitution that gives an unfair advantage to religion and religion like any other group, will abuse any advantage they get. Some of the religionists actually believe it is a violation of their rights if they are denied the opportunity to use the coercive power of the state to shove their god down every ones throat.

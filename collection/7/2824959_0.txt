A CD is a Certificate of Deposit.  It's similar to a treasury bill or treasury bond, nut is offered by a bank instead of by the US Treasury.  you deposit your money for a fixed period of time (anywhere from 3 months to 5 years, sometimes longer), and in return for placing your money with the bank for that length of time, they pay a substantially higher interest rate than you'd receive from a savings account.

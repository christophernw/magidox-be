Simply? You ingest more calories then you work off. If you really want to change yourself, then just excercise, and eat healthy. But remember, no matter what you look like on the outside, you will always be you on the inside, which is all that really counts. I mean, you see those people with the perfect bodies and no one likes them. Those who don't look like them think they're "too pritty/handsom" those who do look like them think they arn't really that good looking. And they themselves might not be truly happy with themself. If you want to be happy, stop worrying about your outside appearence, you are who you are and that tis all which counts!

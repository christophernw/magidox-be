It has do with survival of offspring.  What is the best situation to have the most offspring reach adulthood and pass on their genes.  Evolution is all about leaving the most offspring.  If you are a male you want the most matings possible.  If you are a female you want a man to stay and help you raise the offspring (take us 18 years if we are lucky versus a few weeks or months for other animals), but you might want your child to have the genes of the high mater so your child will leave you lots of grandchildren.  In that case you run off and have an affair, then come home to the sap who helps raise the children that aren't even his.  In biology we call the males that just mate "sneaky maters" (not the actual term we use, but I'm editing for the sake of young ones).  The go in mate with the female while the other male has built the nest, protected the eggs, raised the young.  It happens in everything from fish to humans..   There's a balancing act between "affairs" and monogamy and it is genetic (and evolutionary, the two cannot be separated) and which one wins is determined by whose children survive.. Interestingly you can guess whether females of any animal are monogamous or not by the size of the male's testicles relative to body size.  The bigger the testicles the more sperm they produce, the more mates the females. The higher sperm production allows sperm competition. Yes, that is competition between sperm inside the female.  The more a male can produce and inseminate the female with the more likely his sperm is to fertilize the egg.  Human testicles fall between chimpanzees and gorillas.  We're not as monogamous as gorillas, but more so than chimps.

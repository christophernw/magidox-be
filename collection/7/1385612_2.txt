People hate others because they don't like themselves.  They see in others some part of themselves that they don't like or are afraid to let themselves be because they think others won't like them.. . A lot of times, people gain acceptance, of a kind, by belonging to a group.  That group is stronger, has a better connection, when they can find a common enemy - an outsider that they can gang up on.

Typically nasal congestion is a symptom of a viral infection (ie: common cold) in which case a multitude of nasal decongestants can be used such as sudafed (provided you are not allergic to its ingredients or have any contraindications for use such as high blood pressure).  However, if you suspect that it is related to something such as an environmental allergy (pollen, dust, etc) then an antihistamine such as benadryl (careful it can make you tired) or claritin would help relieve the symptoms.

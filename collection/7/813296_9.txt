There are (at least) two slightly different senses of "anecdotal". . (1) One is in a statistical context. That's the first answer you got (from Thufir). That essentially just means that you are basing conclusions from way too few examples. That would apply, for example, if you were reporting the average weight of men in some age group. . (2) The other sense is like the second answer you got (from Chicky). That's the more common usage and it's not necessarily statistical in the sense that it may refer to a description of a single event (for example), but it may be subjective and therefore biased. In some cases, there may essentially no bias possible because the evidence is so overwhelming that no one could possibly conclude but one thing. If someone says that the World Trade Center collapsed. It either collapsed or he/she is lying.. . From either of these it should be clear why anecdotal evidence is usually weak, not very convincing.. . Here's the definition from infoplease (source (2) below):. an•ec•do•tal. . Pronunciation: (an'ik-dōt"l, an"ik-dōt'l), [key] . —adj. . 1. pertaining to, resembling, or containing anecdotes: an anecdotal history of jazz. . 2. (of the treatment of subject matter in representational art) pertaining to the relationship of figures or to the arrangement of elements in a scene so as to emphasize the story content of a subject. Cf. narrative (def. 6). . 3. based on personal observation, case study reports, or random investigations rather than systematic scientific evaluation: anecdotal evidence.

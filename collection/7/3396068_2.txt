Just to correct something written by 'truthfullyk', the bubbles are not formed by hydrogen, or oxygen that have been stripped from the water molecules.  Boiling water is a physical reaction, not a chemical reaction.  If the bubbles were composed of oxygen gas and hydrogen gas, the situation would be very dangerous as these gases would readily react with each other in an explosive fashion.

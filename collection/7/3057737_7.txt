By talking to Him like you would your flesh father. God can read your mind, Satan can't. Whether you pray outloud or in your head, Father hears you. He will consider your prayer when you meet His conditions. Always talk to your Father in Christ's name too- that is your credentials that you are a believer in whatever He says goes. He likes it when you say "I love you" and mean it, or at least are trying to mean it! Always be as genuine with Him as you can, He knows when you are trying.

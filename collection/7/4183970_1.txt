Fruits and veggies are high in the vitamins, minerals, and fiber that our bodies need to function properly. For example, if you don't get enough calcium (which can be found in spinach and broccoli) your bones can get weak and brittle which will increase the likelihood of breaks and fractures. Or, if you don't get enough vitamin C, your immune system can get weaker which can lead to you getting all kinds of sick. And hey, we all know what happens when you don't get enough fiber!! Hope you've got some magazines in the bathroom!!  . . Besides fruits and veggies really do taste pretty good (most of them, anyway) and they aren't full of empty calories that'll just make us fat, slow, and unhappy like so many processed goodies in the grocery store. Don't get me wrong - I'm not adverse to an occasional can of Pringles rather than a carrot stick...but I know darn well that the carrot stick will help me run faster and better while the Pringles will help glue my butt to the couch and fall asleep without hitting the gym because I lack the necessary energy and inclination!. . (Wow, sorry if that was a tyrade...)

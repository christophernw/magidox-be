Get to know him. Mention a news story that you've seen on gay people or a friend you know is gay or tell him that you are gay/bi, and ask him what he thinks. If he reacts well to gay issues, just tell him you like him. Even if he doesn't feel the same way towards you, if he's comfortable with gay people you can still be friends.

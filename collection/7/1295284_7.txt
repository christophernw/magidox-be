i am of the opinion that if it is nothing important, then we can just simply solve it on our own. of course, gaining an expert's point of view would probably be valuable in helping you to solve your problem and that is why they are often consulted. just try to think of the problem from different angles, aspects, and point of views. explore every option possible and walk in someone else's shoes.. . hope that helped (:

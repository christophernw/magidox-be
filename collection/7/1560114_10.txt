Hmm...for your health's sake is a really good reason.  There is also the effect of second hand smoke on those you love.  The effects nicotine has on an unborn baby.  The fact that it stinks and is unattractive to many of the opposite sex.  It is inconvenient, as now you have to go outside to light up.  Now, as in California, there is the move on to disallow people to even light up on the streets or anywhere else in public.  Otherwise, puff away! ;)

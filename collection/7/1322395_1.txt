It wasn't banned.  Who told you it was banned?  It opened on Broadway in 1953, had a respectable run, and has been produced  hundreds of times--from high schools to professional theatres all around the world--every year since.  It's widely available in book form, and has had a halfway decent movie version made starring Daniel Day-Lewis.  No--never banned at all.. . ADDENDUM:  Now, you might be wondering why it shows up on the so-called "Banned Book List" put out every year by the American Library Association.  That's a bit of an incorrect title for the list--which really identifies books which have been CHALLENGED at libraries (usually school libraries) by people who'd like them removed.  In this case it would probably be because they'd consider Miller a radical leftist and don't want their kids exposed to his work.  But I've never heard of a single library that's banned it.  It's a classic.  Read it if you haven't--and if you can, see it.

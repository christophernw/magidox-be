i agree- doesn't matter if you're black, white, asian whatever. racist behaviour is wrong when it is aimed at other people based on their ethnicity and should therefore not be condoned. its not just blacks and asian victims who have a rough time experiencing it themselves, as whites can be victims of racism too

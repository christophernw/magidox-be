Because Americans are selfish trouble makers who only think of themselves. Americans believe, or at least all those i know, that all the world should know English just so they don't have to learn to speak another language. We say that America is multiculturaled, but they still try to force their way on everyone, just look at what is happening in Iraq!!. . Again i don't mean to generalize, this is just an observation made by an American.

My Uncle Joe used to laugh at me when I was little (because we had a lot of power cuts in the 70's.) He used to say "Vicky can't find her Uncle Joe in the blackout unless he smiles." He always felt he had to get in first before anyone else put him down - even with those who loved him. Nothing has changed and it won't, not in our lifetime.

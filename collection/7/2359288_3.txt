The easiest way is to buy a crate that she can not get in the position to use the bathroom.You keep her in there when you are not at home or when you are not playing with her etc.When you take her out of the crate every time you take her right outside and she will get the idea.Don't ever paper train or she will go on any paper laying on the floor.The people told you she was crate trained,she was alright to go in her crate cause it was too big.If you have not had her very long then she is probably just a little confused.Just get that smaller crate it will work.

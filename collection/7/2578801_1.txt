I've been told to put butter or mustard on the burn (unless it's a second or third degree burn) then you should go to the emergency room. Also, if you hold the flame from a lighter or match close to the first degree burn, it will draw out the pain. It will hurt at first, but it stops soon. Another good choice is cold cream.

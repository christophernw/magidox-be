depends on how deep the absess is...if its on the outside near the skin then they will probably lance it with a scalpel, drain it, and bandage it and give you antibiotics....if its deep and they cant safely lance it then they will insert a needle in it and drain the infection out of it as much as possible and put you on antibiotic.

I don't know.  Reminds me of when I was living in Sudan and was talking about the practice of "killing" a sheep for Eid and other major holidays or festive occasions.  The family buys a sheep, and either a family member or a butcher comes to "kill" the sheep.  My Muslim friends would get all mad at me and say, they don't "kill" it, they "slaughter" it.  Kill sounds nicer to me, but they said slaughter implies that it was done properly...ie, the animal's throat was slit to allow the heart to pump the blood out of the body..."kill" apparently means it died any-old-way.. . No matter what you call the process, it still won't keep me from eating meat...

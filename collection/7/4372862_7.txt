Because angels are usally heartbreakers and they're the prettiest ones at that too. So before they can actually take the pleasure (indeed?) to fly, they'll have to prove that they're up to it. They have to break the hearts of a certain number of people and thats why they come to you in your sleep and seduce you like they're actually succubi instead of angels except that you dont know that your mind is tricking you so you think you're seeing angels and once you fall in love with them, they'd suddenly turn cold like ice and you're left alone mending a stupid heart because you've given it all you could and then suddenly some bells rang and it grew wings and flew away from while you sat (dreamt) there wishing you should have just caught it back and clipped its wings, but hey! nooo you were too stupefied, astonished and entranced.... But yea, theyve earned they're wings hurtin you. And theyve grown stronger and now they can fly. Fly away.

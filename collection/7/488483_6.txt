Well it comes from Mark 16:17 They shall speak with new tongues.It is one of the signs to prove that one is saved.However and most holy rollers don't know this that is why they put on their little show the last 12 verses of Mark were added centuries later it is just one of thousands of changes that the christian theologians made in order to make the book fit their story line.It is nothing more than mental and emotional entertainment.The only thing it really proves is you are easily influenced by those around you.There is no ghost whatsoever involved it is all man made fairy tale.

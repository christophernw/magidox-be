wow, saying that god killed your friend is a really strong statement. i am assuming that you are deeply religous, so don't take this the wrong way. but you shouldnt try to pass the blame onto someone else. your friend took a drug that has been known to kill over and over again. an autopsy would show why the drug killed her. in my opinion, god didnt kill your friend, she did it to herself. my deepest sympathys to you.

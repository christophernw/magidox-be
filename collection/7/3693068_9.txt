Some fishes do sleep. But some just dont due to the fact of their size. I got some big fish such as 3 oscar and 1 clown knife fish which often sleep alot until feeding time or when it day light. I caught them just laying on the gravel next to one another and keeping very still. I was surprise when I saw that.

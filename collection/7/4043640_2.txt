OK well first off dear, you aren't losing a friend! He is just moving away, that's all. I've had many friends move away, it is hard at first but it gets easier. You can always call, use the net and chat or you can write each other. Just focus on all of the good times that you've had. Put a smile on your face, because you should feel privileged to have met a good friend :)!

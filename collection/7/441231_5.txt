How would you feel if you were raped though? & got pregnant... would you want to have your rapist's baby...? You have to think of ALL the issues surronding abortion not the ones you only WANT to think about... Another example, if someone discovered their child would be disabled... some people are just not equipt for dealing with those kinds of situations...

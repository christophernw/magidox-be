Elevating your legs so your feet are higher or equal to your head may help- it will decrease the blood flow to your feet and may relieve some of the burning- I hope you have a cream to be applied to the burn areas.  You don't say how long it has been since you had the accident, if it is more thant 2 days, I would go back and see the doctor to check out your burns.  You feet may be getting infected and that would definitely cause and increase in the pain.  Good luck.......

When you have all that money I guess that there would be a constant worry as to where to put it or invest it. There are so many bad people out there. Think about it - if you had money - who would/could you really trust???? You attract people who want to know you because of your money. Your relationships are affected because of the money. I cant imagine that you could possibly have any real true friends as they either only want to know you because of your affluent image, or because they WANT your money...... I think it would be a headache to have this lifestyle/money. -  When you sleep you could be robbed. When you are awake you could be robbed..... What a headache. Dont forget the churches bombarding you for your good charity.... You would never be left alone... Know any rich people that you really like???? I cant think of any!!!!!!!!!!!! Know any really truely content rich people???   I cant think of any!!!!!!!!!!!!...........

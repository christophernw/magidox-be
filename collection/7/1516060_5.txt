Some time ago in Kerala / India it rained reddish in color. People thought that it is due to the red color sand that has been in the upper atmosphere (how it gone there..?) that mixed with the raindrops and the color of the rain is red.. But one professor in kerala is not convinced with this answer. He collected the rain samples and found that the particles are of Extraterrestrial in nature. That means those particles are close to be a living being only thing is they are not having any DNA or RNA..

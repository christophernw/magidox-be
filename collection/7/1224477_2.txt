The architect deals with more of the "human" issues in the design of a building: appearance, space, lighting, form etc.  He or she would have to be creative, sensitive to human needs, and artistic.. The building engineer deals with the technical side: stress on the beams, details of the joints, stability of the foundation, sizes of ventilation ducts etc.  He or she would have to enjoy math and have a good mechanical aptitude.

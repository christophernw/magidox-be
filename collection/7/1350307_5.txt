Pro choice, what if you were raped and your attacker got you pregnant i think women should have a choice on whether or not they want to keep that child or not, but i don't agree with women using abortion for a birth control method. i am pregnant right now and i know if i found out my daughter had some life threatening illness that she would suffer from her entire life that i wouldn't want to watch my child suffer, therefore i might consider an abortion but not if i was just to stupid to take birth control or the man didn't wear a condom

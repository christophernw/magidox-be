Well I did grow up going to church but i felt silly the older i got. I realised i have never seen any evidence of a GOD, NEVER. My elderly grandparents have attended church for longer than i know but why does their so called GOD find it fit to let them BOTH suffer a long and painful death? Is that a reward for their praise to him or is it just the simple fact that their is NO GOD.. . Do NOT punish me or chastise me for my beliefs, this is my opinion. And dont bother asking 'how do i know if the wind exists if i cant see it' because i can both see it and feel it.

I would not suggest doing it because their fur is soooo nice already.  but if you must, Use something non-toxic and safe for the animal like food coloring. NO Vinegar like if you were dying eggs.  Just food coloring and water and paint or brush it on it's fur.  avoid their eyes, nose, and inside of the ears.. . If you want some safety tips call your local pet-co or pet-smart grooming dept. and ask if it is safe for a rabbit and what they use to dye poodles.

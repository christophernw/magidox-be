Oh ye of such little faith. Religion is about believing not seeing.  No wonder most of the world is going to hell. There are too many people out there who need physical cold hard proof that Jesus really existed in order to believe in Him. Thats not how religion works. Christians get angry because Christians know that their religion is right and everyone elses is wrong. But of course you atheist believe that there is no way only 1 religion is right out of 10,000. So to they dont believe in religion.

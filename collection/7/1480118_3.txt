Creation is when GOD created the earth/universe and reality.. Then GOD created our souls out of HIM.. . Evolution is when our souls came on to the earth/univers and into reality/being thus our souls evolved over milions and milions of years into what we are today. And the earth evolved into what it looked 2 day.. . Short and simple

Gosh, I don't recall that Camus wrote Sisyphus was happy about his dilemma. I'll have to dig out my copy and check it out.. . I'll venture a guess anyway.... perhaps he was happy just to be employed! At least he knew what he could expect from his life, albeit a life of monotony, struggle, toil and failure.

In medieval times, there were two court systems.. . Courts of law granted primarily monetary damages. Courts of equity granted primarily injunctions (orders to do or not do something).. . This distinction has pretty much been eliminated in the US, where most courts can now grant relief at law or in equity, as appropriate to the claim.. . The phrase "common law" generally refers to the decisions handed down by the courts, starting with the Old English common law, and more recently referring generally just to legal precedent derived from past cases. Common law decisions in the US govern interpretations of the law, as well as issues related to remedies at law (damages) and in equity. So, again, the distinction in the US has largely been eliminated.

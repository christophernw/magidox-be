Who said? It's wrong. Women in India acquires more rights than men. All Indian Acts either directly or indirectly provides more rights to women when compared to that of men. See the Hindu/Muslim/Special Marriage Act, Dowry Prohibition Act, Domestic Violence Act, Indian Penal Code, Civil Procedure Code, Evidence Act, Criminal Procedure Code, etc,. The Indian Constitution itself ensures more rights and privileges to women and children of India. The problem is, our society projects women as subordinate to men.

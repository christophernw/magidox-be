Currently the only way of earning money playing games is with prize money from contests. These contests are few and rare so you wouldn't make enough money to support yourself.. . Some people feel it is possible to make a living playing Golden Tee, a Coin Op arcade game found in bars throughout the U.S. Part of their advertisement scheme is a scrolling LED screen listing contests and prize money.. . These, again, are not held often enough for you to consider making enough money at it. Furthermore playing the game is very expensive so much of the winnings would be spent practicing.

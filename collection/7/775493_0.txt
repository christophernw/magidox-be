So far in the area of human expression there has not been an absolutely universal objective method for describing sensory experiences to those who cannot also experience them for themselves. We can only describe what it is like or not like, and let that context reveal its true nature.. . We can only describe the color in the world and let that be the only guide to its understanding. There is no way that we could say a phrase or word and have that result in a perfect understanding of the concept of "red" in the mind of our audience.

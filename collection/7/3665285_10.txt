It all has to do with being properly registered as a legally-landed citizen.  They (the gov) give you a SSN and you pay the taxes you owe, unless you are sponsored by a family member who is already here LEGALLY who can prove that he can support you (financially) for a certain period of time.  From what I read once, you still need proper documentation to emigrate to US if you are from Puerto Rico, which is a US "emirate".  It's sad that some illegals are simply looking for a better life, and have to move from their homeland to do so.

Your question contains the answer your looking for.. . " see some people wearing shorts and drinking iced drinks? ". . Some people prefer things cooler than others, I know I like to keep my room around 60degrees.  Planes, especially on distnace flights, are crampt uncomfortable places where your stuck for hours at a time and forced to behave.  It's easier to keep things cooler where people who are uncomfortable can put on a jacket or sweater than to keep it warmer where people who are uncomfortable can... strip naked?. . Also planes for obvious reasons are forced to recycle their air over and over again.  Cooler environments are more sterile.  That's also why most doctors offices and hospitols are cool.  Bacteria grow fastest at warmer temperatures.. . Hope that answers your questions,. Armus

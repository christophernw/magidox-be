Your analogy was based on the assumption that the man was dead. He wasn't. Further, the parable was aimed at teaching a lesson about hypocrisy, not salvation.. . The people in Hell have died. They made a conscious decision to ignore God's pleas to come to Him. . . It's not a case of whether He chooses to help them or not, these people already made the decision for Him. God won't force or coerce. He only comes when He's invited.

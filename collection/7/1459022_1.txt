practice singing 24/7 get good connections whether with anyone in a radio station,producers,anyone in music or tv .sing at local clubs even if u dont get paid u never know who's watching and u'll want some stage experience.get ur own songs ,it'll be better to have ur own cd then u singing a bunch of other people's songs.decide who u are and what ur style is in music and in presentation,send ur cd to a bunch of record labels.or if that doesnt work try american idol or any other competitions like that if u dont win the exposure will help.good luck and dont give up if u really want it

Okay, first of all Lilith fair is a music festival. I worked on it as a stagehand for two consecutive years when it came through Washington State. Never have I been surrounded by so many angry lesbians, but it was still a lot of fun. The music was pretty good too.. . Lilith (no fair) is the reputed first wife of Adam, and this belief comes out of two places. Jewish witchcraft (not mainstream judaism), and Gnosticism (a pagan take on christianity that emerged about 200 a.d.). Just because a text is old, doesn't necessarily mean it has a place in the bible.

The best thing is to control your apetite. Sometimes when you sit and eat you dont realise how much youve eaten until you get up. So get up and walk a few steps and dont keep eating alot. But if you have to vomit, then hold 2 fingers together and stick them deep in your mouth in your throat until you get a vomiting sensation and it will come out.

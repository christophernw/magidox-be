Yes, Vietnam is a good place to invest. And many garment and shoes and electronic factories have been established there. Don't you see that many dresses and shoes you bought from Mar* & Sp***** are made in Vietnam. And there are many others too. The workers are just paid about $ 30 per momth (US dollars), besides there are many fish factories which are invested by the foreigners. They all make use of the special quota to make more money. So the quicker you invest the higher will be your profit.

its a matter of respect, etiquette and nothing to do with freedom of action.  when you're old enough to have kids and then they keep on chewing while you're talking / advising them - you will soon realize that they're not paying attention to you.  yah! those disgusting gums under the desks.  it shld be banned as we are not responsible enough to dispose the gum in a proper and civilised manner.  i heard in singapore country, to solve the problem they stop selling gum in the city.  you can chew but where to buy it!!!!

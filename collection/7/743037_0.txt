the others have indicated the answer; University of Arizona press, in association with JPL, have come out with a number of useful texts on these topics. I am personally awaiting the issue of "MARS II", which should include all the recent Mars rover data/ maps, and something on the current trends in extrasolar planetary geology, which in the last decade has gone from zero to over 200 bodies discovered.

Outlaw gave you some good information and suggestions. . .  In addition, I would recommend taking up a new hobby or activity; something that you've never tried before and that requires skill and/or knowledge.  By learning these new skills or information and getting involved in a new hobby, it will boost self-esteem and self-confidence.  . . Volunteer for something.  I could just be with a local group picking up trash on the side of the road, but get involved with others in a positive project.  A great one for this is to become involved with young children.  Be a tutor, volunteer with a grade school to help them read books or just as a teacher's assistant in the classroom.  Get involved with them in an afterschool care center.  Little kids are great ego boosts because they will look up to you and make you feel a million miles high.  This ties into my next suggestion which is. . teaching something to someone.  This is what I use whenever my self-esteem and self-confidence are low.  Knowing more or being able to do something better than somebody else always brings me up, so being able to teach my skills and/or knowledge to others makes me feel good about myself.  . . In general, at least in my case, low self-esteem and low self-confidence are because I don't think my life is worth anything, I can't do or be anything special, etc.  Once I combat those causes, it's easier to deal with.  My answer has been to keep busy and make my life worth something, my presence and skills known.  Create a situation where if I wasn't there, there would be a void.  I don't get that feeling in the corporate world, people are so easily replaced and one robot is just as good as another.  That's why volunteer projects, teaching, and kids are all great.  All of those groups would notice if I didn't show up.. . Hope this helps and good luck!. . FR

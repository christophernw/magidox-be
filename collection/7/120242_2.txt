If this is a standard trans. low fluid is not likely going to cause the vehicle to not shift.  Sounds like a clutch slave problem. Sould be next to your brake resivoir little white or clear or possibly black cup that holds fluid. if it is low or empty you may wanna take it back to the place that changed the clutch. may have a leak or they forgot to tighten a bleeder.

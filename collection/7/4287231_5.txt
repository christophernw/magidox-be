Hope this answer helps!!!!  Man could never figure it by means of thought. Words could never truly describe the soul.  The only way is through meditation.  One has to quieten the mind and body to go there. Only then one can become in tune with the soul.  The soul is the sanctuary of God, the absolute, Brahma, Thee Infinite, the Creator, the Universe, the source of all souls, Peace, Love, Oneness..... whatever you may want to call it or not call it.. . The Science of Meditation is the only way of truly knowing and only You can take yourself there.. . . Blessings to you always. . Namaste

what i would try is to let the dog in the room however have a bed for him. have him lay in that bed not yours. this ill take time. every time he gets in the bed put him in his and tell him that is your bed this is mine. in time he will get it that you dont want him in the bed with you. the only thing with this is it will not be a over the night answer. it will take time.. it works i did it for my dog, it took a few weeks

It refers to the era of when men wore pants but women didn't.  It wasn't coined until AFTER that began to change in the mainstream, however.  It refers to who is "in charge" as in that era, men were in charge and women had very little rights (such as voting, holding lands, etc.).  In most cases, it's used in a sexist way, although I have seen it used to describe women who were more dominant as well.

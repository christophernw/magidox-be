We tell our children not to talk to strangers because even as adults we need to be very cautious about the company we keep and even though someone seems nice, they could be out to do us harm.  I do not plan to subject my children to santa because what you're saying is true.  What if they are out on the street and some guy gives them some candy?  They are gonna think it's alright to go with that person because they were nice and because they gave them a "gift".

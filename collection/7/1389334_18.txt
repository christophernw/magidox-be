Because they (on this website) are very combative, argumentative, confrontational and rude. Why don't the atheists log onto hate.com and commune with one another there?  This topic is religion and spirituality, not the lack thereof.  I think it is highly inappropriate for the atheists to bombard this Q&A topic with their attacks,  sheesh!!. . Do they want to "feel the love", well show some.

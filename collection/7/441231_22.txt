The moment the government made abortion legal was the moment the government cut off its own hands.  Who will they govern?  Most of their citizens have died before they were born!  From a purely monetary point of veiw, this is insanity!  think of all the lost tax dollars from future tax payers.  The government will fall.  It is inevitable.  And when history gets re-written, lets hope that this part of it is blotted out forever!. . May the buffalo stomp on the prairie once again!

To mangle a quote and put it in the most simplistic terms, "I think, therefore I can." :). . As to your details, I think you come closest to the answer with your last question. The more we ponder on our ability to think and perceive, the more subjective it becomes, until we come up against that ultimate wall, "I believe I am here, because to do otherwise would lead to becoming lost in infinite possibilities." Are we the man dreaming he is a butterfly, or the butterfly dreaming he is a man? We have no true way to know, and at some point we simply have to accept the external input of our senses and move on, or go crazy trying to look at the infinite.

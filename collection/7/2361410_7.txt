Theists believe in the existence of a god or gods.  Atheists are all the people who are not theists.  Your question "...how can they believe in any person" makes no sense so I can't answer that.  The reason we're all here is that we are the product of unthinking, undirected natural processes.  After death there is the same thing as before life - i.e. non-existence.. . Atheists are in touch with reality.

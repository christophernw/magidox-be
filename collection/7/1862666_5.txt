I would never watch 'Temptation', even if someone offered to give me money to watch it. I will go to see 'Da Vinci Code'. Its supposed to be about conspiracies and secrets about one of the most influential religions on Earth. I may not be a Christian, but I was raised one. And I'm all about learning something new about things that are being kept from the public view. Rome took Christianity and created a whole new religion out of it, in my opinion. They maintained power and influence despite no longer having an I'mperial Army to enforce their Will. Im curious about Devinci Code.

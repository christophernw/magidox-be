I would say that a liberal is one who believes that government's role is to take care of people.  A conservative is one who believes that the government should stay out of people's lives.  However, in the current political climate, a liberal is one who wants the government to stay out of people's morals and a conservative is one who wants the government to impose his values on everyone.

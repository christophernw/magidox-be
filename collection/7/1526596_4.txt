It is possible through daily prayer.  I find that looking at a cross helps when you are tempted and also doing something active, like dancing or running.  It is a day-to-day struggle for some.  The best thing to do is make a resolution to God that you will no longer do those things.  Sometimes this is helpful to do with someone you trust so they can hold you accountable.

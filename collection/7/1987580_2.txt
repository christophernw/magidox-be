The highest wave on Lake Erie in 2005 was 8.2 feet, not terribly impressive.  A lake, even one as large as Erie, lacks the large scale movement of water that can generate the rogue waves sometimes seen on the opean seas.  For the same reason, lack of large scale movement, a significant tsunami could probably not happen on the lake.  A tsunami has a wavelenth of hundreds of miles, which means that Lake Erie doesn't have enough space for a tsunami to even rock back and forth once.

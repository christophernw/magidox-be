What many posters said was true...the US Armed Forces now is a shadow of what it used to be in 1991 because Clinton cut the military budget to finance his domestic agenda. Bush is no different but hes fighting a war (and his domestic agenda is worse than Clinton's). Asides from poor infantry armor they didnt even bother to improve the Humvees used in Iraq till long after. And get ready for more...the US Army plans to replace the M1A1 tanks and Bradleys in service which do relatively well now with junk like the Stryker and the Future Combat Systems which wont survive anything thrown at em (they claim speed, stealth and maneuverability will protect them...Hahahaha as i launch an RPG to kill the stupid Americans). They seem to be giving less attention to providing tested and proven support to the troops and focusing more on stupid and overambitious ideas like robot planes and lasers. Thats where the US taxpayer's military money is spent folks...crazy/junk projects not troops and reliable equipment.

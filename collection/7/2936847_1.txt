I'm inclined to agree with Matheson.  It depends on how zero is used, adjective, noun, or verb.. . As a noun, zero is singular, zeros is plural.  There is a zero in the comment bar.  They could use ten zeros and it would still mean zero comment(s).  . . As a verb, she zeros in on the target.  Now we are talking tenses.. . In the sense that you are referring, it's like asking if NO is singular or plural.  . . =)

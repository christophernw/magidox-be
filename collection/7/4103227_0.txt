In the U.S., it is due to cold dry air from over the Rocky Mountains mixing with warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico.  Most tornadoes occur in the summer, which is when the air from the Gulf of Mexico is hottest, so it provides the most energy at that time of the year.  And "Tornado Alley" consists primarily of those states positioned between the Gulf and the Rockies.

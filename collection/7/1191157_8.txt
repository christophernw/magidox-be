Albumin is a protein that is made in the liver and released into the blood. It helps prevent blood from leaking out of blood vessels, and it carries medications and other substances through the blood. It is also important for tissue growth and healing. When albumin levels drop, fluid may collect in the ankles (pedal edema), lungs (pulmonary edema), or belly (ascites).

its a virus.  viruss do not respond to antibiotics only bacterial infection.  you can get the flu shot which will help prevent infection .  viruses are only treated by prevention with vaccines which introduce a small form of the viruse into your body.  your body then builds antibodies against the strain introduced there fore when you do come across the same virus in the environment your body has already built a defense against that specific virus and you are less likely to get sick from it. having said that the "common cold" virus mutates and adapts and becomes stronger and more resistant with time so its very difficult to find a vaccine that will prevent infection from the constant changing virus.   Bacteria (which are microscopic "bugs") are actively killed by antibiotics which aggressively attack the bacteria at the cellular level this is not possible with viruses.

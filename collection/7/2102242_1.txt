first off how do they explain the drop in species when the thoery is based on mutation adding genetic material. and most of the mutation that adds material makes people disabled, as in trisomy 21 which is downs syndrome. and most of the mutations actually take away genetic information. plus the order of evolution, which came first eyes or nose gills or lungs and if the process is so slow how did a perfect mutation allow animals to come from the ocean. and the fact that amino acids forming from base elements under any circumstances would be equivilent to winning the lottery 16 or so times in a row.

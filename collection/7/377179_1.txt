Obviously they are just using standard buttons on all ATM's and not bothering to buy non-braille version specifically for that use.. . Speaking of that, I read today where some woman needed to show ID so she handed over an ID card with her picture stating very clearly that she was a blind person.  The teller said it wasn't good enough and asked her if she had a driver's license instead.

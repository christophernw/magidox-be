Dr. Scholls has a great plantar wart remover, which is painless, you just do the treatments until the wart and root are gone.  It's very simple to do, and can be found at most drug stores.  You need to know that, left untreated, you'll probably get more of them, the little dark seeds in the wart shoot out, and implant in other parts of your foot.

well if you can, pay off the loan first. IF you're counting on money from the sale, be sure you get enough to cover what you owe. It varies from state to state. California give you 10 days max from sale to processing of paperwork. of course, they can't enforce what they don't know but the purchaser will be expecting a title within 10 days generally and if you're using that money from the sale for other things, you could end up in a world of trouble.

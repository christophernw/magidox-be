I'll quote you:. . "There is only one right answer, but there are no wrong ones. I really want to see if anyone is thinking the same answer as me, which could also be wrong.... ". . So, the only right answer (ASSUMING that's your answer) could also be wrong?. . I agree with you - the answer you have in mind could be (is probably) wrong.  As I don't know what it is, tho, I don't KNOW that it is.. . My 1/2 arsed explanation; there's an environmental niche where remaining an ape remains an advantage.  Ask Richard Dawkins for more details.

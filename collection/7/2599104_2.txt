well, i don't know if this happens to EVERYONE, but i am pretty sure that is happens to everyoen in diffrent places, lke on your legs hurt adn all diffrent types of things happen. but i learned something from my science teacher about something like this, and its almost the same, but when your body does that, its working on DIGESTING your food, adn so all its attention is over htere, adn thats how you get tired too, and so its not relaly working on other places, so you look like that and feel like that, besides that, when your sick, the same thing is happening only your body is trying to fight the desiese or infection adn so you look like your sick when you are sick because you body is working somewhere eles.

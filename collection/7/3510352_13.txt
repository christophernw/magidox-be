Check the laws in your area....I know here in the USA certain farm animals are not allowed in city limits. It may be illegal for him to even have the pigs there. You can also try getting a petition started around the neighborhood to have the pigs removed. . . However DO NOT poison the pigs! The person who suggested that should be assamed for saying such things. The pigs did nothing wrong. It's not their fault that they are there.  Killing innocent animals is not the appropriate way to go.  PLUS if his pigs just died one day he could have a necropsy done and they'd find the posion and from the sounds of it he'd point the finger at you. You'd be under investigation for animal cruelty.

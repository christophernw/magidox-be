Get him a dog bed that is either close to yours, or in another room.   This will become his special spot for naps and bedtime.. . Enforcement is the key.  If he is to always stay off, then spend time with him outside the out of bounds area, so he doesn't feel he has to compete for your attention.  If he's allowed on while your awake.  Encourage him, when it's lights out to "go to bed" in the dog bed.

Losing weight and being fit is more than just cardio or weight training. You have to have a good diet and your eating patterns have to be regular. A small meal six times a day (every 2.5-3 hours) is a good way to go.. . If you don't feed your self regularly throughout the day your body will think you are starving and try to retain fat to protect itself. . . Take a look at the nutrition section on www.bodyforlife.com.. . When you exercise you also gain muscle so have your body fat percentage checked regularly. Don't feel bad you are more than just your weight!

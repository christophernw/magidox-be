Follow directions on box expect replace the cold water with alcohol.  The more alcohol the stronger so you can use a combination of water and alcohol to tame them down.  I suggest flavored Smirnoff like raspberry or strawberry depending on what flavor jello you'll be using.  Pour mixture into individual cups, dixie cups work the best, and put into the fridge til they set.

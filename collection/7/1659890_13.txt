Louw and Nida Lexicon says: "to employ water in a religious ceremony designed to symbolize purification and initiation on the basis of repentance - 'to baptize, baptism.'". . The word "baptize," as it was used in non-religious texts was used of dunking fabric in dyed water to change the color of the fabric.  . . Romans 6:3 Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?

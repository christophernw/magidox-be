If you are talking about the voter Identification Bill, I think it's a joke, a waste of time and a waste of the tax payers money. There are no Pro's to it. It also states that "if a person does not have the proper identification, they may still cast a ballot by signing a sworn statement affirming his/her identity". So what is the point of wasting time and money for such a Bill.

A Financial Advisor is required to be licensed as a CFP (Certified Financial Planner). They're required to take a test put out by the Banking Commission for their state.  Personal Bankers??  Never heard the term, but after working in the banking arena for almost ten years, I can tell you that bankers in general aren't required to be licensed.  The bank is licensed, but the tellers (and most of their employees) aren't.  Ask your "Personal Banker" if he's licensed......

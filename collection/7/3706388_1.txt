No such term exists.  Emotionally selfish?  You're supposed to be able to feel what it is that you're feeling.  Maybe what you're asking is if you're not compassionate?. . If that's the case, compassion is simply the act of feeling someone else's feelings.  Compassionate acts are another subject.  . . Anyway, if you're worried you only feel your emotions don't worry, some people don't even know how they themselves feel.  Want to be more compassionate?  Just try to feel what others are feeling, not what you think they're feeling, but just feeling them.  It'll take some work, don't worry if your feelings are just working for you in the meantime.. . Good luck

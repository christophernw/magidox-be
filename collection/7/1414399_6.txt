It takes a lot of searching to find a specific style to suit you. Keep searching. Ask yourself what styles of comic art you are drawn to visually. Also, what you expect out of yourself. My style is somewhere between abstract and comic art. It took me about 3 years to fine tune it. I've been in art my whole life. So keep at it. You can do it.

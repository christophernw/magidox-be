Cherokee is the most common Native American bloodline. Many people of Native American ancestry cannot find their paperwork to prove that they are Native Americans. I have been told that in the old days people were ashamed of a nonwhite bloodline and most with American Indian blood covered it up. Even people who took care of vital statistics "covered" for for some families so they wouldn't be stigmatized. Sad.. . My husband has been searching for years for the records that prove his native ancestry. So far nothing has shown up except hints and old photos, and that is not enough to officially prove your ancestry. He has some coloring and features, and my kids have features, but that is not usable as evidence. We hope that someday we can afford DNA testing on his blood.

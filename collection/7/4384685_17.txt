Truffles are expensive because they are considered to be a delicacy. Since they are mushrooms they may be somewhat difficult to differentiate between good and rotten to the untrained eye. However when they are found they bring about a massive amount of flavor to the food in which its being cooked with.  In 1825 Brillat-Savarin called the truffle "the diamond of the kitchen" and praised its so-called aphrodisiac powers.

some thing or some ONE is out there every morning at that time, and your cat is watching it..... that would be my only guess...I believe if you look you may see what your cat is looking at..but cats have eyes that can see in a much darker atmosphere than humans can so even if you do lookout the same window or another window you may not see what your cat is looking at..plus just your movement at 4am may scare whatever your cat is looking at away... set up a video camera... Good Luck

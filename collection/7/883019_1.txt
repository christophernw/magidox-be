There are 2 way to achieve this :. A. Anorexic-hard core diet way. Keep yourself busy, always have something to do. . 1. here is a trick, always try to wear sexy, fit into your body clothes and find the smallest, tightest you can just barely fit into especially around the waistline, jeans will work best for this, but not the stretch one (even if you have to lie down or ask someone to help you pull the zip :p). To push the body more wear a corset. Keep everything wrap your body so tight that only leave you enough room to breath an bend. Those tight clothes will "press" your tummy back, it will remind you not to eat, and even if you eat it wont allow you to eat much. . If you fell that those tight clothes make you look like a sausage, wear a loose jacket or sweatshirt on top of it.. 2. Drink a lot of plain water (at least 3Lt a day) a big glass of water before eating will fill you enough you don't have less space to put your food into, especially if you have done no.1. . B. Spiritual way - meditation

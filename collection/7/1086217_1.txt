Borneo is one of the largest island in Southeast Asia, if not in the world,, and it's right next to Papua New Guinea. It's known for its beautiful tropical rainforest, Orang-Utans and an unique bird called the Hornbill. Borneo was found and governed by Sir James Brooks (Rajak Brooks)and his descendants from England. Borneo has its own indigenous groups such as the Iban (formerly known for their headhunting skills and blowpipe weapons (using poison darts)), Dayaks, Penans, Kadazans, etc., who are the original inhabitants of the island. . When the British Rajahs (Sir Charles Brooks and family) left after WWII .'cos England was almost bankrupted by the war and could no longer support their colonies financially, one third of Borneo, namely the 2 States of Sarawak and Sabah, joins the federation of Malaysia. These 2 States are known as East Malaysia. The capital city of Sarawak is Kuching (meaning "Cat city" in Malay), and the capital city of Sabah is Kota Kinabalu (KK). . Today both Sarawak and Sabah are federally governed by West Malaysia (the Malays), majority of its local economies/industries controlled and run by the chinese (2 generations since the 1800's), and the local State governments making up of the various indigenous groups. . The State of Sabah, which is near the southern tip of the Philippines, is known for its scuba-diving enclaves annd also has the highest mountain peak in the region known as Mt. Kinabalu. . The rest of Borneo island was sized by Indonesia (Malaysia and Indonesia went to war for this), and is called Kalimantan. There's also an independent country between the States of Sarawak and Sabah called Brunei. It's  oil-rich and it's still protected by the British (the Gurhkas), and the Sultan of Brunei is one of the richest man in the world as listed in "The Fortune" and "Forbes" magazines.

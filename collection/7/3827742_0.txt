if you're worried don't do it. your body should not be available because someone else thinks it is.  you do not owe him anything. when will young women learn that their body is their gift to life and not a trade bargain for affection. of course you have something to worry about, like standing up for yourself, like looking in the mirror and realizing just how precious you are...no trade offs girl, he probly will leave sooner or later, let him go with your dignity in tact.

It's a world view that teaches that wanting and fearing things brings more wants and fears, and defines you as a person.  They say that this is generally not such a good thing, as it usually results in dissapointment and loss, so buddhism teaches to live your life in such a way so as to lessen the impact of desire and fear on you so you will have a clearer view of how the universe works and how you fit into it and gain some peace.  This is usually done through meditation and learning to control your impulses with the goal of slowing down the cycle of desire, satisfaction&#92;loss and desire that defines the majority of our existence.

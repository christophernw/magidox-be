I think there is a lot of racism and resentment against Mexicans in this country because so many of them have migrated and are now making huge impacts : most services, for example when you call your bank, have a choice for Spanish; many Mexican immigrants now have businesses and are heavily represented in the construction trade, as well as other trades - painting, plumbing, etc.  Many are now entering politics and are holding offices.. . So, I believe Mexicans are the most vocal and visible immigrants which is why they bear the brunt of the racism, not to mention the great numbers of Mexicans who have crossed the borders illegally.

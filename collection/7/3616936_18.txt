The whole political battle probably started with Proposition 187 in California.  That year, Cal's budget had a $2 billion deficit, about the same as spent in social services on illegal immigrants.  The whole issue was seen as racist by many and made worse when the proposition passed, but most of it ruled unconstitutional because it tried to cover areas delegated to the federal government.  Mexico started a verbal campaign to support it's citizens - legal and illegal - in the U.S. Supporters of the prop also felt spurred by the government and started a campaign to draw negative national attention to illegal immigration.  9-11 didn't help, although all the terrorists entered the country legally and only later turned illegal.

The first answer is right in that you don't want to have a high tax return.  If you do, you basically gave the government an interest free loan for a year or whatever.. . If you claim 0 as the others suggest, you might get a bigger return but you paid for it.. . A simple example.  Your company will withhold an additional 100 each month, so you're paying 100 extra.  Then, your tax return is 1200.  So you loaned the government money at 0% interest.  They're just giving it back to you later.. . By having a small return, you minimized this effect and that's generally a good thing.

Colloids are mixtures whose particles are suspended and never settle out.  They appear to be homogenous because you cannot see the individual particles.  However, if you shine a light through them, the particles will scatter light.  This is called the Tyndall Effect.  Examples of colloids are paints, mud, gelatin, milk, may, whipped cream, fog, etc.. . A previous poster already gave a great definition of chromatography, so I won't repeat that one.  . . Hope this helps!  :)

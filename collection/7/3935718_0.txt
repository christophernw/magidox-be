The best thing to do is get a scratching post and other toys to keep them happy and if you catch them on the curtains take them to the scratching post and put their paws on it. If they scratch it then give them a treat and tell them they are such a good kitty. After doing this a few times they will get the idea and leave the curtains alone.. My husband did this with a cat he bottle fed and she never scratches anything but a scratching post.

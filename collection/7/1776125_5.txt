put it in a skip and get a real one :-). . sorry, but  i think your best results would be to use very heavy cookware and let it heat well first.. . you will not have the start stop type heat with electric that you gets with gas.but if your trying to get up eneough heat to cook a black and blue steak or something, heavy cast iron pans are the way to go.. . It is the same problem with non stick cookware, you are only supposed to use it at low to medium heat, which just doesnt help for many dishes.. . Electric ovens, on the other hand, especially fan assisted and steam ovens, are gifts from god.

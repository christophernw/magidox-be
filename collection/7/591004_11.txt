LMAO, all these people who say "get a real job" and "it doesn't take much to serve a meal" obviously haven't worked a busy restaurant in tourist town during dinner. I'd like to see half of these snarky nimrods do what I do at least half as good as I do it. Gauranteed they'd quit after the first table, I have NO doubt about that. I make awesome money at what I do.I do it because my children are important to me and I can be with them during the day and work at night when their father comes home, plus I can make alot more money serving than I can working at some office somewhere, infact most of the time I make about as much as my mother does as an LPN nurse. Although I'm sure that I won't be doing this for the rest of my life, it works well with my husbands busy work schedule and my children still see their mother, and I'm not tired and yelling at them because I've had an exhausting day. I am an Airforce veteran, and have gone to school, so you're not talking to a complete idiot here either. If somebody tips me less than 10 percent, I can pretty much chalk it up to them being a tight ass  or a jerk, not because I don't give them my 100 percent. I just kind of laugh and think "what goes around comes around." Thank God that there are  more people out there who give a damn then who don't, to those people THANKYOU...to the rest, sucks to be you!. . . I forgot to add...to all of you who say you cannot afford to tip because you are "poor". What praytell are you doing going out to eat in the first place? Stick to fast food or ramen noodles, don't stiff a hardworking server...that's just a lame excuse and it's very selfish to boot. When you go out to eat at a restaurant that serves you, don't forget to anticipate the tip that they work hard for!

Well, I don't know about HAND fungus, per se, but I know a bit about athelete's foot... same difference.. . Go get some monistat. Yes, the yeast infection treatment. that will knock out any fungal infection quicker than anything else around. You might have to wear gloves so that it will stay on your skin long enough to work, though.

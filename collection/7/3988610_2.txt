God is neither male nor female, other than in incarnate form. Theologically, God has no gender.. . But the reason Catholics now feel able to make sacred iconography, is because God has gone from a form we cannot conceive of to a form that was made incarnate for us. That form is Christ. And Christ portrays the Father as he portrays himself, and uses the term Father not only to denote his filial relationship, but the filial relationship he intends us to have as well.. . As the gospel of John tells us, "Nobody has seen the Father, except the son," who now tells us "whoever has seen me has seen the Father.". . We've had the very image of God in our presence, in our midst, and that incarnation is made present for us every Sunday on the altar at Mass. That presence is male - which is not to say that God is not the source of maleness and femaleness. But it is to say that our approach to God is always through the Son, and there can be little doubt as to the gender of the Son.. .

St. Therese of Lisieux (doctor of the church, and patroness of priests.). The Virgin Mary. St. Mary Magdalene, "disciple of the disciples" and witness to the ressurection. Mother Theresa. St. Theresa of Avignon, founder of the discalced carmelites. . Many of these became recognized as saints at a time when secular society expected women to slave in the fields or in the kitchens and regarded women as property!

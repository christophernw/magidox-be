I agree with you that any type of Molester should be put out of this world, However the bible teaches us that we are not to judge anyone, we are to turn all sin, problems over to the Lord.........The problem with that is we are humans do not live by faith alone, so when we turn it over to the man, we in fact do not...........that is why we have a law system that should treat them at least as badly as they have treated say a child or whom ever but they do not..........the Christians on the other hand and I am one of them want to save the sinners.........I can tell that I have a problem saving child molester as they cannot be healed I feel........... . The link below give some info on pro and con's...........

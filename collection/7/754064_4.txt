Speaking as one that was there, it sucked! These morons wanted to go along on sweeps & patrols with all their lights & gear, making all kinds of noise. They got a lot of guys mesed up, plus the pictures they showed to the folks back home of dead US troops demoralized the people that should have been supporting us. They didn't show actual pictures of engagements during WWll cause they didn't want to freak the public out at the massive losses & it worked. The public, IMHO, doesn't need to see everything.

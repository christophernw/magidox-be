live on bare neccessities, but treat yourself to something small at the end of every week, for saving whatever you made. . . Also, get a savings account at a bank that has very limited service. i.e. some banks do not have ATMs everywhere and thus when you take out money using interac your required to pay a fee. this might stop you from wanting to take out cash. and also sometimes these types of savings accounts come with debit cards that wont work if you are trying to pay for something at a store using your debit card. (Hence the idea of saving). that might help you save and get rich.

When someone else abuses their power and inflicks harm, It dosen't give you the same right. It would be a justified if the UN santioned it. After all, We bassically wrote the UN rules. Now we have violated the international laws that we created. How will other countries ever trust us again. I thought being trustworthy and honest were good traits. At least that is what I tell my kids. Don't forget Bush was AWAL for a year before daddy bailed him out.

Well stop thinking that the answers are outside of yourself and listening to what people have to say about you and what you should do and all the bla bla bla.. . You can define your reality, the trick is to stop paying attention to what everybody else says you should do and find what you really want. If you been pandering to other people for a while, it's gonna take some time to find out what you really want.. . In the mean time use that anger as energy to build YOUR reality, because you will have to fight some people to get it.

Do you mean with our own selves or fellow humans? I assume you mean fellow humans. Well conflicting hypotheses about how the world came about, essentially it's all different philosophies and people want to be right. Let me elaborate, humans need those different opinions for the openings of their mind, however conflicting views on a diety makes a human angry because their faith is shaken, something that they sincerely believe in is doubted and to me that seems like pretty substantial reason for self destructiveness

Theology is rooted in written religion and prescribed beliefs while spiritualism is free style and dogma free. The spiritual but not religious person doesn't adhere to a particular dogma or way of believing. It also encompasses a wide range of possible beliefs about the existence and nature of a higher power. Theological religion however, has a set idea of God.

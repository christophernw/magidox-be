if you were raised christian and you still believe in god, and jesus you are a christian, but you are what they call a backslidden christian. someone who is a christian but is no longer faithful to the church.nothing wrong with believing what you feel is right. just because the bible says you are suppose to attend church does'nt mean that is what is right for you. listen to your instincts.

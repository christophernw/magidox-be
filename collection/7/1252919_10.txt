There is no moment of death.   The definition of death is arbitrary, and varies from one jurisdiction to another, and it changes with time as our medical knowledge improves.   At one time, cessation of heartbeat was a fairly reliable indicator that you were no longer a going concern, but not any more.   Cessation of brain electrical activity (a flat line on an electroencephalogram) doesn't necessarily mean that you can't be resuscitated either.   In the distant future, with nanotechnology, it may be possible to piece together an accident victim with horrific injuries and make them as good as new.

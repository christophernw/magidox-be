your first answer is good keep out of sun light but don't leave full of air, air has moister in it so leave a little air in it, like a air compressor they all have a drain plug to get the watter out,  to maintain rubber memory need just a few pounds in it and store in a well ventilated cool inviorment and if laying on side put something down like wood cause cement will rot the tire in long term, concrete is always wet and will rot if set a long time on concrete or black top, put wood or a pallet, or do wha tthey always did in the old days take off the rims and completly wrap in somthing

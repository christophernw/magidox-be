Some of those who are deemed insane and it may only be momentarily insane as in the heat of anger. Most murders are not intentional they happen in the heat of anger, when people are not thinking rationally but just following emotions. For instance the guy who is beating up his wife following his drunken irrational behavior may not be out to kill her but does so there is no intent there, just irrational behavior...Being mentally disabled doesn't mean you are insane at all. Just because someone is depressed doesn't make them insane or irrational, they still KNOW the difference between right and wrong.

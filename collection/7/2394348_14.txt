you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ....and you will be saved.....now that in itself is humanly impossible...only by the Grace of God can one believe...so pray, that God will have mercy on you and give you the grace and the faith to believe in Jesus...also, while you are praying and seeking God...check out http://www.biblegateway.com  the "new king james version".... and i suggest reading matthew mark luke or john...to get a better understanding of who jesus claimed to be and what He was about...if you seek the Lord with a sincere heart, you will not be let down...He loves you and wants to see you come to know Him, and to be born again...reding luke and then acts, might also help....but its not about you seeking, but the Lord showing mercy...so be patient and dont give up...He will NOT let you down, i assure you of this...

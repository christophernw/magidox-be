You know what? I began drawing over images from comic books and magazines. You would think that that would spoil your own style, but it doesn't. As you just doodle over these images, they do look different because you highlight them with your own touch. Try it, and soon the art of drawing anything you want will come very easily. . I'm a serious artist now, and doing mostly realistic sculptures. I have won many awards, and My work is very original.

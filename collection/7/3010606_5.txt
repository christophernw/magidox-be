Interview a couple of veterans.  I was six or seven years old when hostilities started, but was involved in the evacuation of Saigon in 1975..   Go to Google..   Go to your local library..   Keep an open mind and realize that there are no truly unbiased opinions.  It was a war.  Don't let anybody white-wash it or demean those of us who went over there by referring to it as a 'conflict'.

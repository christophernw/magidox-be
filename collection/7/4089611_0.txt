I don't know about common, but it does happen.  However, I have a cat that was always getting sick and the vets were trying to put him on evermore expensive food.. . This last time the vet saw him, the vet told me that some cats get IBS, because they need more fiber in their food, and he recommended checking the ingredient list for higher fiber foods.. . I did that about a month ago and he is muuuuuuuuch better now.

You do get waves in lakes and even in smaller bodies of landlocked water, such as rivers and the Coorong in South Australia.  The waves have been dangerous to many; some canoists drowned in our Lake Alexandrina, for example, because they did not realise the danger of that wide lake in windy conditions.. . You do not get deep ocean swell in lakes.  That is a bit different to "waves".

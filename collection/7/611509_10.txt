Its not our fault either. Perhaps its your attitude. Perhaps its because its obvious you resent working in a place where you are overworked and underpaid. Perhaps because you are blaming the people who keep you employed for your bad day. . . I make it a point to shop in a store that respects its customers enough to hire union checkers. It makes all the difference in the world in attitude and I am willing to pay a few cents more for things to not have to put up with someone who takes it out on me.

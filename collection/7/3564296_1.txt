It depends on the age of the house and the extent of any damage done to the house (if any).  Rarely will it cause much of a snag in property value because owners usually take precaution to have the infested area treated before severe damage is done.  In addition if you live in an area prone to get termites such as Houston, its not an uncommon thing to find a house that has been treated.  If the structure of your home is okay and you have the house inspected and the report comes back clean I wouldn't worry about it.

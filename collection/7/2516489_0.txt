Thrush is caused by an overgrowth of yeast, usually caused by antibiotic therapy.  If the baby is breastfeeding, this can be passed to mom's nipples.  Acidophilus is great for treating yeast, but you should consult with the baby's pediatrician about treatment and ask them what you need to do to treat yourself if you're breastfeeding. Otherwise, you'll pass it right back to baby.

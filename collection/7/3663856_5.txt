The Jurassic was named by Alexandre Brogniart for the extensive marine limestone exposures of the Jura Mountains, in the region where Germany, France and Switzerland meet and covers the time period of 196 million to about 145 million years ago.. . The funny thing is that most of the animals in Jurassic Park come from the cretaceous period (145 million to 65 million years ago)

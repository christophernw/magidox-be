I have thought of this very question before. Why should a man have to put the seat down when he finishes? Why should we not have to put it up for them when we finish? It is as much "work" for a man to put it up when he has to go, as it is for a woman to put it down when she has to go. So what is the big deal? I am a woman, but I say, if a woman is too lazy to look before she sits down, then she deserves to sit in water! LOL

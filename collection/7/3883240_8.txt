you can be charged with 1,000,000 volts of electricity and it wont hurt.. lol they do that on the high voltage lines.. Electricity works by equaling out the electrical pressure. when there are more electrons on one side than the other, they flow to even out.. Electricity becomes harmful when you become a part of the path.. It would short circuit your heart and it would stop beating.. Only a very small amount of electricity need to pass directly through the heart for this to happen.. your cell phone has much much more energy than the amount  required.. But not to worry, the contacts of your battery would need to come in direct contact with your heart.

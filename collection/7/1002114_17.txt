Keep your cat out of the bedroom. Mine gets me up 6:15 when he thinks it's time to eat. It's a pattern. Have you been reading books on spirituality or sleeping with the T.V. or radio on? My dreams sometimes go with those when they are on. I'm not sure what the reason could be for you being extremely emotional. What helps me with that, when I get like that is to cry good and hard one time. It washes it out.

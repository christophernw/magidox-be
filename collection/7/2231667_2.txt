customer service sole purpose is to address questions and complaints, mainly complaints, that customers have with the business's product or service. inbound call centers are the hub of customer serviec as they are the frontline in receiving and addressing customer concerns and complaints while also trying to solve them. the outbound portion of customer service is generally resigned for those problems that the customer service reps were unable to fix or attend to and need the advice of someone more qualified to address it. Usualy things like tech support or consulative solutions are used for outbound facilities.

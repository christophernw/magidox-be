Well since i just did this i will try to enlighten you.. first you need to look and see if there is a male hose end where you put the dipstick in if so go to a boating center like bass pro shop or similar and get these items a drill pump,and you will a couple of pieces of garden hose cut into lengths of about 2 feet each,an electric drill,3 clamp on female hose ends,and a bucket or container to pump the oil in.. Take one section of the garden hose and put the 2 female ends on it.. take the other section and put on one end of the other hose.. 1.attach the drill pump to your drill.. 2.screw both hoses to the pump.. 3.screw the female end of the hose to the dipstick (be sure to remove the dipstick). 4. run the drill so the till the oil comes out you will probably only get 4 qts out of it.. oh and make sure you put on a new oil filter and lube with a small amount of oil the sealing ring on the filter.. If your boat motor does have is male end on the dipstick tube look for drain plug in the oil pan and try to catch as much as possible and clean your bilgle well after it.. Good luck.

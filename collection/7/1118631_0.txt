<>Three things come to mind: 1. Alternator:  Get it tested (if it's really bad, your car will stall if you disconnect the battery while the car is running).  2. Bad Battery: It DOES happen!  Take it back where you got it and let them check it.  3.: There really IS a drain somewhere and you haven't found it.  I had a battery going dead, searched and searched, finally, one dark night, noticed that the vanity mirror in the sunshade was lit...the switch had gone bad!  You can use a multimeter to test for drain when the system is (supposedly) shut off.  Set it to Milliamps, disconnect the (+) battery terminal, and put the meter in the circuit.

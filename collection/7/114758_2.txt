Do you often make statements on beliefs and topics that you have very little knowledge of?  Do you feel superior by belittling someone else's belief?  Try reading the bible, with a open mind, and heart.  It may speak to you, you may have to actually change your life, you may have to love someone above yourself, so if you want to quote the work and Word of God, maybe just maybe reading it first would help you look less ignorant.. . Wow, let me see if I can take anything else in this sad world out of context, or written in another language and use it to misinform people.  Mr Slambango-try reading the verses directly before and after the ones you quote, try learning what the culturistic meaning would be by these sayings and events, of you tried actually studying who Jesus was and what it meant in the first scripture you quote, you would know why you sound so silly to anyone who does know Jesus as Savior.  You are actually telling the very reason being a Christian means having to let go of unbelievers sometimes, especially ones whose hearts are hardened.  It also is later referring to why I won't tell you that you are an idiot, slanderer, moronic or anything like that, Jesus came to fight my battle and guess what?  I win.. . Martin-you are such a better witness than I, thanks for the uplifting!

My cockatiel, Cramer, is 16 years old and lives in my office.  He often screams, sings, whistles, talks, definitely makes noise -- the music thing works sometimes, and covering them up will work at night usually. It sounds like your bird just wants your attention so if you want some peace and quiet you probably won't get it if she is being ignored. Oh, make sure she has lots of toys too.

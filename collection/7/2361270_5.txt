preheat a pan with a little olive oil-make sure it is nice and hot. add just a pat of butter. sear your roast( should be salted and peppered, you can also slit the roast and place garlic cloves in the slits). sear each side. then place in a roasting pan with a little water(enough to cover the bottom). place in preheated oven-350 and cover. cook for about 3-5 hours depending on size of roast.  check now and then and reapply salt and pepper or garlic salt

What i do is this.. i get a pan of water, when it starts to boil.. Add your pasta. Stir a couple times let boil. Around 20 minutes your pasta should be ready.. Take out and drain.. Hope this helps.. My pasta is always fine. You don't want to leave in long. As the pasta seems to lose its texture...good Luck....

high school is a world of it`s own. on Earth we see prejudice, right? so, why should`t this mini-Earth have the same things as it`s big sister? and plus teenagers are filled to the brim with raging hormones that act hieratic in a way that will, maybe seem shameful in a few years. people do things they wouldn`t normally do, because they want to give a certain image, they want to be accepted or they simply do these things because they don`t know any other way and some aren`t willing to choose another path.

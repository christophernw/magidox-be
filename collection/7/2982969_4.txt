The cat probably scratches herself because of an infection. Either take her  to a vet or if you can't afford it get some liquid flea stuff. They sell it in the supermarket.. About the litter box issue. Try using a different kind of litter, or move it and put her in it. She'll soon get the idea, i hope.. . All my cats have been indoor/outdoor cats, so I have never had that problem. I used to have a litter box for one of my cats in case he got trapped inside. But he would just lay in it like it was his bed, goofy cat. I now have a 4 month old kitten (looks like a full grown cat though. HUGE, furry and fat.) and he has pooped in the house ONCE. Sorry for rambling on about nothing. Hope I helped.

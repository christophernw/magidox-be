Body language can convey more than just plain words.. For instance if the speaker folded his hands it could mean that is is not willing to accept what you are saying. If the speaker is shaking his hands wildly then he is deparately trying to convince you. If a speaker is trying to hide his pams probably his is lying to you.. When we speak we communicate with both our body and speach.

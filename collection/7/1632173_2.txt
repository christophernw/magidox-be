I think both units of measurement are bogus.  PMPO is a ridiculous measurement designed to further confuse an already confused consumer market.  RMS Watts are a measurement that describes a speakers ability to accept power for a prolonged period without damage.  It doesn't measure how efficiently the speaker uses said power and it doesn't describe the quality of the output.. . I would like to see a new industry standard unit of measurement introduced that with one glance will tell you power handling, efficiency, and frequency response.  This is a pipe dream, because the industry likes to keep the consumer in the dark, but a guy can wish, right?

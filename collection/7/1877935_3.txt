If you can believe in God, it doesn't matter. God has a nature outside nature that cannot be explained;  he/she/it breaks all our rules. It doesn't matter that, to us, free will makes no sense.. . That's why talking about God as if he/she/it were rational, or could be understood rationally, can be rather pointless.

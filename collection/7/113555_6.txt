By getting food and putting it in your mouth. Chewing, swallowing. Repeating.. . Seriously, start each day with a bigger and bigger breakfast, this should increase your stomach size. I am wondering why you would want to eat more, you should only eat as much as you feel you need to, more would not be healthy. Your body does know what it needs.

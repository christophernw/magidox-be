You need to be an American citizen to register for jobs at a career link, or on a job website.  There are employment agencies in every large town and city where you can seek employment and there are classified ad websites. If you aren't an American citizen, you must have a green card, if you lie about your citizenship bad things will happen. Recently, around here half of a construction crew was deported for illegally obtaining jobs, and for forged documentation.

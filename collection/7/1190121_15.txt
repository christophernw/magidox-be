When you are in sleep mode your spirit side of you is actually traveling and experiencing while your physical body rests.  During spirit travel you encounter many great situations such as sometimes flying, etc.  These other experiences are not situations we in our rational mind encounter in the physical realm.  At times our rational mind may jump into the experience and question what is occuring.  . . For example when we are feeling like we might fall, our rational mind says "oh no, I am going to get hurt or die!"  That is when we jump, your spirit-self entered your physical body at lightening speed and as you awoke most likely your heart was racing.

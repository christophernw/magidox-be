Before you start to clean your microwave.  Mix some baking soda, grease fighting dish soap and water in a bowl and microwave it for 45seconds(ithink) this will help to loosen everything that's caked on inside.  Then just wipe down and use a spray cleaner for anything left.  But to be honest there are sometimes it's just easier to get a new microwave!

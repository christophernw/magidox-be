when you are younger status is different than when you are older.....when you're young you're kind of "keeping up with the jones's", monetary things are important....as you get older (like your aunt's age) priorities shift and monetary things are very unimportant, but family becomes more important than ever....it's almost a status symbol to have all your relatives calling and/or visiting regularly....elderly people really value that personal contact......so i would say that your spending time with her dropping off whatever the gift is will mean more to her than the gift.....

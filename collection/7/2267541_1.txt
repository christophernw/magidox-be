A red-eared slider with a 2 inch shell isn't able to be legally sold, at least not in NY - because of the potential risk of salmonella.  (The theory is, tiny turtles can fit into the mouth of small children, and because reptiles can have deadly salmonella bacteria, that could be bad...). . As for age estimates, I have heard you can count the rings of growth on one "scale" (scute) of the shell - one ring is about one year of growth, but that isn't too accurate with the very young or very old (scutes wear down with age)  at 2 inches i'd guesstimate it at being less than 2 years old?  Check a turtle website to get a better idea.

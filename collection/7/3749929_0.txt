My friend recently lost her job and broke up with the guy she was working for. Now, she is dire straits and has no savings.. . I emailed her and asked if she needed money. Also, when we meet for lunch or dinner, I pick up the tab saying that when she gets back on her feet, she'll treat. . . If your friend is out of work, help with the resume and with leads for employment. I would tell her/him that you can be counted on to help in times of need. A big hug will seal the deal.

Please don't try to do that on your own. You can really mess your horse feet up. My husband and I have seen some really messed up feet that have ended up hurting the horse. That is what he does for a living and I trim right along with him. You need to find a farrier that has some school training so that you know he knows what he is doing. Just always remember healty hoofs happy horse cause with a hoof you have no horse. . . Ok now to shoe a horse you have to first make sure you have the food trimmed and level and at the correct angle. If the angle is not correct it can really harm the horse. Then you have to measure the foot to see what size of horse you will need. If you do it like my husband does then you have to bend and shape the shoe using your hammer and anvil. He also puts a suction on his shoes which is what you call it when you bend the shoe and make it suck up tight to the foot so that it doesnt come off. But he has to do this cause we gareentee our work for 6 weeks. But after that you have to nail the shoe on. When you are doing this you have to pay real close attention as not to quick the horse and make his feet sore. You can quick a horse just as easy as you can quick your own finger nails. After you have all the nails in you have to break off the unused part and clinch them down. This is so that nails do not pull out of the hoof and shoe when the horse walks.  When you clinch them all you are doing is rolling the end of the nail that is sticking out the top of the hoof. Then you have to finish the hoof. Which does not have to be done but it does look better and in some cases helps the clinches stay down better. It also helps the shape of the foot stay the way it is supposed to. I hope this has helped you some. GOOD LUCK

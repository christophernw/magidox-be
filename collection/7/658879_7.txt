Most "virgins" do not have intact hymens....Why?. . 1. Tampons-While inserting tampons during their periods, most young women "break their hymen" tissues. Very common.. . 2. Masturbation-While using a finger or other penis-replacement object, the hymen is broken. Very common.. . 3. Doctor-Some young women have their hymen tissue broken during their first ever gynecological examination. Not so common.. . Most of the time, you never know when it takes place exactly. The old stories about bleeding when the hymen is broken are pretty much fictional. There is generally so little bleeding that it is not noticeable.

Unless a person asks for help, its foolish to try to help them.  Have you ever had somebody say, "I will pray for you", when you didn't have a particular need?  To me this can sound like a veiled judgment.  I think your boy friend might feel the same way.  . . You can ask him if he is happy about life.  The way he reacts and answers will tell you what his attitudes are.  Respect them.  . . If you trust your friends, take their advice seriously.  There is a complex called the 'saviour complex'.  If you have it in this relationship, you have the problem.  Ask yourself, do I find people in need, attractive.  Do you think you can save them?  If so, do not use your boy friend in this way.  Love him for who he is, not for what you can do for him.. . Sorry if my suggestion sounds harsh towards you when you are trying to help somebody.  I am sure you are a nice person but friends are often right with this kind of advice.  They can see our patterns of behaviour often more clearly than we can ourselves.

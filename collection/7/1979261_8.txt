While the big bang is not specifically about biological evolution it is a cosmic view of evolution. The Bible states that the world and the heavens had a beginning and that the heavens are expanding which is similar to the big bang theory. However, the Bible is very clear that God spoke the heavens (the firmament) into existence as well as the earth on the 2nd and 3rd days of creation. We get the word "universe" which means one verse to describe the creation event by God speaking. . . The big bang has many made up steps to it which are pure fabrication. Explosions do not lead to order and coordinated function as we see in our universe. There are too many exact variables that are established for earth to be able to sustain life to be based on random circumstances. Design of the universe screams out to its observers. Biological evolution joins up with the big bang and so they are really inseparable. The big bang is really a supernatural view that some scientists accept while denying the supernatural Genesis account. It really comes down to a clash of religious viewpoints since the past formation of the universe was not subject to observable scientific observation by mankind.

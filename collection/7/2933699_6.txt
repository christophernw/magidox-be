. If the break pads  were installed but the rotors were not replaced or resurfaced, then the rotors must have the "glaze broken" on them. This usually involves taking piece of sandpaper and rubbing it all over the rotor surface in a swirling motion. During this process, it will become immediately evident as to what you are removing by sanding the surface like this. A layer of old break material will remain on the rotors and cause friction problems like noise or uneven braking.So it is important to remove this residual matrial that has been glazed onto the rotors by the heat produced by friction durring breaking. Often times, squealing can be as simple as having neglected to use some anti-queal compound between the pistons and the break pads. I like to use Teflon anti-squeal shims along with the anti squeal compound. The compoun is sold in small singe use packets for less than two dollars at most chain auto part stores. Also, when pads are installed, regardless of the rotor condition or preparation, they must be completely free from grease and oil. In fact the surface cant be contaminated by these things what so ever for proper brake function. That is why there is a special spray called brake parts cleaner that is made specifically for cleaning brake parts, as it dissolves oil and grease off the parts with out contamination them with petroleum. If you replaced the pads yourself, you can often remove them and clean the pad surface with brake parts spray, or denatured alcohol. If you choose to do this, you can take the opportunity to pit some anti-squeel compound behind the pad. .  It could be much easier to advise you if you would have stated in your question who installed the pads and what measures have been taken to reduce the squeal thus far. Also it would be helpful to know the procedure used and the condition and preparation of the rotors too. Good Luck.

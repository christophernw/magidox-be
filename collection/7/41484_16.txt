You're right, real Christians are getting harder to find.  You can't really blame people for not wanting to be a Christian with some of the examples out there.. That said, be careful not to fall into the same trap yourself, and be tempted to believe that ALL people generalize christians:  a lot of folks are honestly looking for the truth and will hear you out.

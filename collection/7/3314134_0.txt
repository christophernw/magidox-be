there are a certain group in our society that are just that special.  they don't have to use turn signals, they don't have to park their cars in a space and instead just park it right in front of stores, they cut you off, pull out in front of you, walk in front of you without saying 'excuse me', they butt ahead of you in line, when you hold a door for them they look at you like it was your job and they wouldn't dream of lowering themselves to say 'thank you', and they generally act like the rest of us are here on this planet to serve them because they have some divine right to be assholes.

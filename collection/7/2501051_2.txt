When I'm feeling creative and don't want to expend too much effort, I just make book marks. It's kind of fun.. You can buy blank index cards (I got mine from the dollar store) and fold them over once, glue the sides together, and decorate. The folded index cards are the perfect size and thickness and they make them without the lines.

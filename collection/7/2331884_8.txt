Research has shown that we use fewer muscles to smile than to frown. Also that when we smile we release a chemical that makes us feel better (so if you feel sad, just smile and you'll feel better, though laughing makes you feel even better). And from practical experience, a smiling person is seen as a friendlier person and so approachable, easier to talk with, maybe nicer. An always frowning businessperson isn't going to make customers feel like busying from his/her store.

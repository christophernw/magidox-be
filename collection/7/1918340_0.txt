I suppose the fastest way would be by Eurostar train to Paris, then a connection to Rome, then transfer to Brundism and a ferry to Athens then a ferry to Mykonos. But really, I think the expense would be more than taking a flight from London to Athens and then ferry or connector to Mykonos. Lots of package deals from London as well.

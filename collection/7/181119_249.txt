Well finding a summer job can be hard but if stop and think about what you like to do for fun or a hobby then find a job that has to do with that. say you love animals, go to an animal shelter and ask or be a vet asst. or if you like to skate go to a shop and see if you can help make them. or if you like to eat then get a job at a fast food place.

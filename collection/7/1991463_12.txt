It all matters where the label is coming from.... . People who are envious or misunderstand our GREAT country will label us "evil".  . . However, we label those we do not like as evil too!  We (the media, individuals, and/or govt.) have labeled countries (and their citizens) as evil in the past and will always do!  It is one way of deflecting our inadequacies or if our economic, financial, or political policies are not working.  Our current gov't have unilaterally labeled countries as "axis of evil" while accepting others like Saudi Arabia, Sudan, China, et. al., who have long standing human rights abuses, as its friends and allies in the fight with the terrorists.. . It's all in the label so read them carefully.  Don't eat too  much saturated fat!  no good.... baaaddd... . ============. Dre Person--- Don't you say nothin 'bout Looney Toons...

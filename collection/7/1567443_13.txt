Yes, there are days monts and some times of the year that are dedicated to certain Godesses and gods.. . I don't recall what day is what within the Hindu pantheon.. I think Monday is dedicated to Shiva.. . Then sometime in October there is a full 10days dedicated to all the Godesses... Durga celebration,,,, Which celebrate Kali, Sarawati, Durga, Laxmi and more.... . Good night !

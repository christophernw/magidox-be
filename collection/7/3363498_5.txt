A carcinogen is a substance that is capable of causing cancer in humans or animals. If a substance is known to promote or aggravate cancer, but not necessarily cause cancer,may act on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), causing dangerous changes, or it may work to increase the rate of cell division. This change in cell division may work to increase the probability of DNA changes. Some carcinogens promote the development of cancer in other ways as well.

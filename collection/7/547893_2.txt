They do too! And when they do, it is really nasty! You gotta use this thingy that looks a bit like sharp pliers, to scrape it off when it becomes too much. The older the cat, the more tarter and plaque and gingivitis builds up. Generally young cats or kittens do not have this issue. To slow the build up process, feed your cat dry cat food and treats to help aid in the scraping off of the undesired yellow color on their teeth.

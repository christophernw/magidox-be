This may be goofy, but you can buy those dry washcloths that have face soap in them and carry it in your wallet...wash your face mid day.. Also can blot your face with tissue.. Maybe try a new soap at home?  Cetaphil bar soap for sensitive skin is wonderful.  Make sure whatever soap you have doesn't have oil in it.  Look for something with salicylic acid...it cuts down on acne and oil.. I'd also recommend an astringent or a toner.  I use Pond's pore minimizing astringent.  It's a gel and feels great on the face.. Good luck!

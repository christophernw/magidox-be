Foreign language isn't given as much priority in US schools as it's given in other countries, I think.  There are some elementary schools where students have an opportunity to learn French or Spanish from a young age, but most students don't get the chance to study a foreign language until at least middle school (around age 12) or more often high school (age 14-17).  From what I've heard, many other countries start their children out with learning other languages from their earliest school days, so they have a much stronger foundation for learning languages and a lot more time to become proficient than American kids.  Right or wrong, foreign language just isn't given as much emphasis here as it is elsewhere.

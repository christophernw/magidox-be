Religion is a great brainwasher anyway.. . Let's not single out the Muslims, although they appear to be the soup du jour.. . Throughout history, the bloodiest, most brutal wars were fought because God said it would be a good thing.. . You can always find justification in the badly worded books of their faith. Throw in a little interpretation and you can make "Love thy neighbor" mean, "Blow the crap out of him and all his family."

Jehovah loves everyone, but sometimes he loses his patience... just like we Christians do. If someone continually does homosexual acts, or commmits adultry that is not right. Sure... you can repent, but some don't. We get angry and protest (well not me but others do), because we are angry. We give you spritual food and you throw it in our faces. We try to teach you of God, yet you do not listen. That is why some Christians result to swearing, because they are angry and upset when people wish to continue and sin

My experience is your gonna fight the a monster each time, but to get through it the quickest, see which ones have a "green" light at the base of each tower. Three of them have green, three have red. Do the green ones and you'll only have to do three monsters(be prepared for the boss monster you face after that-he only uses magical attacks, even though he appears to his you he does no damage) You don't have to do all 6 towers.. . Hope this helps!

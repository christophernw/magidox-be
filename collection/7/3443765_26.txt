He created us to have a relationship with Him. The Bible says that in the cool of the day, He would come and talk to Adam and Eve. He had created us in Eden. We got ourselves kicked out, through disobedience, which is the reason for the pain and suffering. But- you can ask for forgiveness of your sin, believe that Jesus was the Son of God, and died for your sins, and you can have a relationship with Him, even in 2006. I know, sounds a little spectacular. Well, it is. He is an Awesome God. My best friend, My Father, My Jehovah, Creator of the Universe. And He will walk with you. In spirit.

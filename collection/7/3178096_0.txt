Sleeping with someone is a phrase brought in to common usage by Hollywood and TV in the days when mentioning sex was banned. So instead of saying 'I had sex with him' (which would cause the film to be banned) the phrase 'I slept with him' came in instead on the assumption that if a man and woman shared a bed to the point of going to sleep for the night then they would have been intimate enough to have had sex. The phrase is still in popular use in films and TV today and used by people who don't like using more explicit terms. Even in the bible the sex act is disguised by describing it as 'lying with each other' from which we get the expression 'being laid'.

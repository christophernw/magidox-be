its so funny 2 hear all the these answers, i myself have never had this problem but my bird used 2 do that 2 my son and my son would just take it and keep picking him up and the bird gave up on biting him.  he was lucky i guess.  Seriously tho there are training videos.  I agree with dont tap onthe beak, it is a territorial thing, it seems little birds r very territorial.  i would try the vinegar trick but i dont thnk hot sauce will do the trick its got 2 be somthing bitter that they will taste horrible 2 them.

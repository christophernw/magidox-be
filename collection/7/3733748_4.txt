Let's see what happens in Massachusetts over the next couple of years.. . It's looking like the people who have actually lived with it are realising that same-sex marriage does absolutely nothing to undermine het marriage.. . And trust me, the dems aren't pushing for it. They are way too 'moderate' for that. (Anyone here old enough to remember way back when 'liberal' actually meant something?)

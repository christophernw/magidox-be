Two main sources. The first is that when the earth formed, it was very hot. The earth formed from a cloud of gas and dust, and then gained size from larger asteroids crashing into it for millions of years. This left the early earth as a ball of lava. Because the earth is so large, it cools very slowly.. . Since the earth cooled from the outsize in, it eventually formed a crust, which insulates the inside even more, and slows down the cooling process. A good portion of the heat inside the earth is left over from its creation, about 4.5 billion years ago.. . The other source of heat is the decay of radioactive elements inside the earth. In the liquid early earth, the heaviest elements would have sunk to the middle. The earth's core is believed to be made mostly of iron, but there are traces of uranium and radioactive isotopes of thorium, and potassium.

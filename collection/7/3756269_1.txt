The advantages are that your party did not get us into a war that we cannot win (ie: against an idea), that has cost thousands of lives, millions of dollars, and replaced a terrorism-free stable tyranny with an unstable islamic republic filled with terrorists and, according to Bush "Weapons of Mass Destruction related programs that could easily be restarted".. . The disadvantage is that the frontrunners in the democratic party are the minority who actually voted to give the president the power to conduct this stupid, pointless, terrorist-creating war.

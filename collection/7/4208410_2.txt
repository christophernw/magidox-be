Try somehow to put yourself in their shoes. I find if i can somehow justify their actions for them its much easier to see where they were comming from and maybe i would not have acted out in the same way they did, but if i can see where they were comming from its easy for me to say ok, its done and gone, cant change the past, but every day is a new day. i know i've done things in my past that are far from perfect also, and to think of my imperfectness and to understand that no one is perfect, and we all fail in different things helps too. The #1 way to learn how to forgive is to feel true forgiveness. In fact it may be the only way to forgive. We as humankind are all forgiven for every bad deed we ever committed. We need not hang onto the failures of our past. We were all set free from these things a long time ago, and it is only in ourselves that the guilt and pain remains. in order to forgive others, we must accept the forgiveness of god in our lives and feel that true forgiveness/to know that everything is alright. then we may help spread gods love and forgiveness by following his example in our lives.Jesus paid the price for our wrongdoings, when he died on the cross.Believe this and ask god to take all of these things from you and ask him to help you show your friend the same love and acceptance that god will give you.

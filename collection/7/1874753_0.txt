Spina Bifida is simply a failure of the posterior (back) portions of your spine to fuse in the midline while you are a fetoid.  This failure to connect may or may not leave a void.  If the Void is large enough babies may be born with the sac and spinalcord on the outside of the spinal canal on the skins surface.  This may put pressure on the nerves and kill them leading to paralysis.  Many people are born with a simple gap that may be sealed with cartilage, which protects everything properly and they have NO problem with it at all.. . Some thought may be given to low folic acid levels in the mother during her pregnancy.  Folic acid has been shown to prevent neural problems.

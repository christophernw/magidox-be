For hard surfaces it is best to use a 1:100 solution of diluted bleach (1 tablespoon bleach in 1 quart water).  For soft surfaces like couches or rugs steam cleaning will probably be the best way to get rid of the MRSA and everything that can be put in the washing machine (blankets, pillows, towels, etc) and washed on the warm or hot cycle at least twice then dried in the dryer.  And try to make sure you wash everything!  Including things that you may consider already clean (like clothing in your closet and dresser) as they could have been contaminated.

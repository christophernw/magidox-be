Warm moist air, cold dry air, and an electrical charge separation between the Earth and Space.  The charge comes rolling in from the Sun, and what we get is a balancing act in the form of tornadoes, hurricanes, and lightning.  The greater the charge separation and the greater the ability of the Earth to balance this charge (cold dry air meeting warm moist air is perfect for allowing such a charge recombination) the more extreme the weather gets.

because some kids today are little s.o.d.s and teachers have absolutely no power to punish them properly. it only needs 1 or 2 to disrupt an entire class. these kids can be abusive and insulting, if the teacher gives anything back to the kid they are at risk of loosing their job. the situation is a poor one.

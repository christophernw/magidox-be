Intelligence is the capacity to understand things, and motivation is the desire to do things.. . Being highly intelligent but unmotivated, is useless.  Being less intelligent but highly motivated, is BRILLIANT.. . Intelligence is useless without the motivation to use it.  Useful intelligence NEEDS motivation, however motivation does not need intelligence to be useful.. . People who suffer from Downs Syndrome or similar conditions who are highly motivated can still get jobs and do useful and helpful things.  People of high intelligence but choose to do nothing, simply take up space.

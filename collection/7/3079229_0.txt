If you are in a school for massage they should instruct students in all aspects concerning the massage treatment for a client. This topic is obviously very important because first impressions are important and this topic should have been covered by your instructors or in a book or some type covering customer relations.However I would think it would be good for you to behave in a professional friendly manner to your client and smile and state your name to the client and ask how they are today and escort the client to the massage area to do the massage. Good luck. Nuf said .

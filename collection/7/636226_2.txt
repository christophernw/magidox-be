I don`t let a religion dictate to me what is right or wrong.. I have done some bad things in my life ,but it was my parents teachings that made me atone.. Young people all make mistakes ,lets face it ,it`s part of growing up.Our feelings is what teaches us right and wrong.So I haven`t sinned ,I`ve made mistakes.. We ,as we get older take into account how what we do affects others.If something bad was done to you ,it teaches you not to do that to others. Plain and simple.. I certainly wouldn`t let a pedophile priest or money hungry minister tell me how to live .

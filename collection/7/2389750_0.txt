Get one from your local animal shelter.  They need good homes, and shelter dogs, in my experience, make great pets because they somehow know you rescued them.  Plus, the adoption fee (which is usually around 50 bucks) covers all your shots, and getting the fixed, so it works out much cheaper than buying a dog or getting one for free.

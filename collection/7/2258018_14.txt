Abortion is the medical term for any termination of pregnancy before the embryo or fetus is viable, that is, able to survive if born. After that it is called a stillbirth or a live birth, depending on outcome.. . Many people thing abortion means only induced termination of pregnancy but this is medically incorrect. It is common to call a spontaneous termination a miscarriage and an induced one an abortion, but not totally accurate. We will chart a spontaneous abortion as such, and an induced one by the method used. . . So much emotional baggage is attached to the word "abortion" that some are uncomfortable using it at all. In fact, many if not most "conceptions" never make it to viability. Nature wastes quite a few fertilized eggs quite naturally.. . I suspect you will get quite a few answers based on emotional responses rather than the correct terminology, but I teach medical terminology, so I will stick to facts.

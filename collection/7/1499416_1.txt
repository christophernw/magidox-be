If the dericative is negative, the function is decreasing, if the derivative is positive, the function is increasing.  For example if the derivative graph starts (-2,-2) passes through (0,0) and stops at (2,2), then the graph of the function will be a parabola with minimum at (0,0).  . . I'm sorry I can't explain this more clearly without having to draw the graphs.....

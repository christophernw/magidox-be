basically no difference........ . hyaline cartilage is found in synovial joints, it is a smoother type of cartilage, regulated by chondrocytes, hyaline cartilage articulate (means allow movement)the 2 bones by providing a smooth suface (ie less friction) so the 2 bones can glide against one each other freely by the epiphysis so movement is possible, that's why the hyaline cartilage in a synovial joint is also known as articular cartilage

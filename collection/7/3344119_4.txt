I don't know, but the idea spills over even among secular-minded people:  "Oh, I'm a vegetarian, too!  I just eat fish!"  . . Okay.  If you have to, you know, cut a head off in order to eat it?  It ain't vegetarian!. . I believe it was because beef and pork were luxury items in the medieval era, and fish was easier to come by (just walk to the river and get you one!)

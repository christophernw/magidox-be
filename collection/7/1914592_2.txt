Cocoa Beach is actually the closest beach to Orlando.  You can zip across the Bee Line Expressway (now also called the "Beach Line" Expressway...also known as State Road 528) and be there in about a half an hour.. . Cocoa is more "vintage Florida" than Daytona, in my opinion, and its also the home of the original world-famous RonJon Surf Shop.. . There's also a cool pier at Cocoa.

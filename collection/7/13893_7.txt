I don't believer you are from any of the tribes of Israel. Today in the age of Grace all people are alike before God. Galatians 3: 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. The question is why would you wish to be from one of the tribes of Israel? They have fallen and God has blinded them. They rejected what the Lord Jesus Christ did on the cross for them. He died for their sins also, Romans 11: 25 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. God does not want you to be ignorant that Israel is still trying to keep the law of Moses and they have rejected their king and they are blind and can not see the truth.

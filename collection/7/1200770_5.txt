man there is noone able to exaplin things right !!! . pee first of all is water + some chemicals such as salts and uric acid .. those chemicals accomulate in the blood and when they circulate in body they are filtered by the kidney, which then u 'pee'. if the water content of your blood is high more water will be ejected and will be dilute (has less chemicals) .. when you are sleepin you dont normally drink and your body secretes more chemical compunds and less water, therefore more concentrated pee. ;)

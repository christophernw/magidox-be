If you get a bad keg, that's rare... it's probably a problem with the keg itself, not the beer. You CANNOT get a skunked keg of beer, but the batch may be off.. . Beer skunks because of a reaction to light; beer in green bottles and clear bottles will skunk faster than beer in brown bottles. When beer fills a keg, it does not have enough time to skunk outside of the brewing keg. Ergo, it cannot skunk. But it could be a batch that's gone off because of age, or because it's been tapped and retapped incorrectly. If this is the case, then the place you got it is kind of sketchy. They shouldn't be selling "used" kegs. . . If you really think that you have a bad keg, don't drink it, 'cause, well, ew, but bring it back. If they give you a problem with it, don't let them; they can turn it back into the distributor for a full refund, so they shouldn't have a problem helping you out. They probably won't issue you a refund, but you may be able to change out the keg.. . Just don't try it if you've had more than a quarter of the keg; if they can feel the difference in weight, they're going to laugh you out of the store. If you go out for dinner and don't like your meal but you eat it, you're not going to get any sympathy.

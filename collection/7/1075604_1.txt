You know how when you eat chicken wings, sometimes there is a little meat left on the bone? Well, "waste not want not," says the poultry industry.. . After all the good meat is carved off the chicken's bones at the slaughterhouse to go make boneless breasts and thighs, the bones and residual meat are put in a giant press and extruded through a "mechanical" sieve that rends those little bits of extra chicken meat into a liquid slimy grey pulp. The bone residue is then removed and the pulp is used.. . This liquid chicken is perfectly safe and legal according to the FDA, though it must be labeled on products that contain it. Enjoy your Slim Jims.

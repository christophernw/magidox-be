The bible says nothing about gay or homosexuality, it says SODOMY IS A SIN and we should not allow them to live among us.  . Deut 23:17  There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel. . Lev 20:13  If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. . . The thing is that these sins seem to propogate themselves and the sinner wants new companions so tries to convert others.  . We also don't want thieves, liars, or any other sin running rampant among us.   The Bible doesn't mention crack, why don't you want to live next to a crack house??

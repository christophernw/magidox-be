I have been getting numerous, ugly cold sores for years.  Finally, my doctor put me on a long-term therapy of Valtrex.. . Anyway, see if she can get a prescription of Valtrex from her doctor.  Use a corticosteroid cream or gel with it directly on the sore.  Be sure she keeps her hands clean and don't kiss her!  It's very contagious!!!. . MASSIVE doses of the natural supplement Lysine (found at drugstores) during an outbreak help.  Also good, if she can find it, is a lysine gel that she can apply to the sore while continuing to take the Lysine tablets.  If she gets them frequently, then she could take Lysine daily.

Ok here it is. If your not too drunk the night before to remember...Drink water before bed or floor which ever the case may be .upon awakening drink tomatoe juice chug at least half a small can. thats it. hang over symptoms will begin to go away within minutes.I swear this works well. If a very nasty hang over is the case drink more juice take tylonal call in sick.eat toast crackers.

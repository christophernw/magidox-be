First, that is a very unhealthy goal. it would require cutting calories and eating hardly anything which is not healthy at all and I strongly discourage it. I reccommend a smaller goal. How about 10 punds in 2 weeks. That can be done and it won't wipe out all your energy. Cutting calories can deprive your body of energy since it runs off carbohydrates. Exercise and eat healthy. Watch out for foods with large amounts of carbs and calories. Cardio excercise is best for you-aerobics, running, dancing, or my personal favorite-kickboxing. I hope this helps. Good luck!

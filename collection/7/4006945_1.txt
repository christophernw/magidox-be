If you are looking for the document called a Land Contract,  you can get one from any legal stationery store ( possibly even Staples or Office Max).  Or you could call a local real estate company or title company or attorney's office and ask if they would give you a copy. ( I am a Realtor and constantly give them to people).  IF you are looking to buy a Land Contract as an investment, again contact any local Realtor - we are always looking for investors.  IF you are looking to buy a property on a Land Contract, again contact any Realtor and let them know what kind of property you are looking for.  I hope this answers your question.  Your use of the word "legally" confused me. There is nothing illegal about any of the above info on Land Contracts. Write back if you need more information.

I always thought Sodomite was a funny word. Not all homosexuals engage in sodomy, nor does that accurately define the female homosexual. Some may think the word is base. You would also have to call heterosexuals who engage in anal sex with women, Sodomites. I'll say this much, I've never met a man or woman who hailed from the land of Sodom, nor have I met a woman who's ancestors lived on the isle of Lesbos. It's just semantics.

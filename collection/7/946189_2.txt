Your friend should have the option to PROGRAM her / his phone with your information on it. Once this is programmed, anytime YOU call, your name should show up on thier tel.     Most updated telephones have this feature.   -  The telecomunications industry has been "under the knife" recent years claiming that PRIVACY is lost, with everyone having caller I.D.. I hope this helps.

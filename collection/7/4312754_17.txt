if you want to lose weight do it sensibly. remember...if you lose the weight fast, i can come back just as fast...you will eventually need to eat again. If you cut your calories to 1200-1500 per day, drink a lot of water and stay active you will lose weight at a healthy pace...about 5-7 lbs the first week and 2-3 every week thereafter...and that weight will stay off.

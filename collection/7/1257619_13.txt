Well, I don't think I could do it! Especially with so much adversity. So I guess I respect those people that put themselves into discomfort to spread the word they beleive in. I think some of them can be a bit annoying, but then again I think some of them really care about other people. But, I don't beleive in eternal damnation. Jesus went to visit souls in hell for three days after he was crucified as documented in the Bible. If I was in hell I would have been grateful of a visit by the son of God.

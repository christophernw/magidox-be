France has a real problem with unemployment still over ten per cent as compared to countries such as US and Australia with more sensible policies. Worse still, some 23 per cent of people aged under 26 are unemployed. This has led to the development of an underclass as shown by the riots last year. The rioters are members of a privileged elite who are working to deny others of their generation the opportunity to get a job.

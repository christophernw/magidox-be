Look at the way the world has become due to peoples pride of being superior because of religion and ethnics. Religion has caused many unjust wars and on what? Belief in a god you cant see,hear,talk, or even prove and how every God of mostly every religion gives the A-ok to kill your religious rivals. The way every religion demeanors another and declares them false, thus creating tensions. The constant bashing against eachother based on these beliefs. You know, someones religion must be wrong, yet people always believe they are the right ones. When you look at it in a neutral view, you can see the war of beliefs. Its pretty depressing. But I guess I should join your religion and be born again into a merry, gay, happy person who ignores other faiths so that my individual life could be justified.

America mainly benefited by having the French to sell the land, thereby connecting Louisiana to the rest of the United States of America.  The land and the Mississippi River was a conduit for International commerce, so the waterway would have posed a Military crisis as well as a crisis with international trade.  The resources of Louisiana were valuable, Tobacco, fruits, and veggies.. Good Luck.......

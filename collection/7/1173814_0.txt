Generally when someone has a fever it means that the body is fighting infection, so it might be a good idea to take this question to your doc.  In the meantime, drink cool fluids, lukewarm bath, cool cloth on the head, take a med known to reduce fever such as tylenol.  Record how high the temp is to tell your doc.. . I hope this helps.

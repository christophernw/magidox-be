I think you might being missing the point of having a child....to love them unconditionally and teach them to be good and responsible adults.. . My only concern when my son was born 22 years ago was if he was healthy. When I held he right after his delivery I noticed he had 10 toes and 10 fingers.  After that....he was and is my son forever and I will love him forever.. You won't care what your child will look like the instant you see and hold him or her.. . Good luck.

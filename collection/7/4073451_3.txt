I actually had to laugh at the images that your question conjured for me. Thinking back on most of the men in my life, there were several parts of their anatomies that rarely, if ever, saw daylight; except during bathing, or at bed time. Particularly, their feet. . . As children, boys will go barefoot as often as possible, subjecting their feet to broken glass, splinters, the errant fish hook, bug bites and stings, etc. But, as adults, memories of those past injuries to their tender well-protected peds, is not something they wish to repeat. Unfortunately, not (all) memories are long-termed.  While lured to sunny, exotic locals, many a fair-complected American man of European heritage has commonly, and unwittingly, sacrificed that virginal creamy flesh to the broiling rays of the sun.. So, one answer to your question is this: Enduring a severe sunburn, especially to the tops of your feet, vs. wearing comfortable, but ugly socks with sandals? Ugly comfort will win hands-down every time!  *Smile*

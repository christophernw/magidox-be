Its just politics. Liberals have in the past denounced Saddam, N Korea, etc - but today - they are incapable of claiming anything is evil, for it would agree with Bush, Reps and cons alike. . . They look at public perceptino, then make a decision after they have poured over that perception. Immediately after 9/11 - every Dem Senator and liberal made grandiose soap box statements  concerning "evil" - because the American public required it. Now, that the sentiments are largely against Iraq - they have switched gears and denounce anything "evil"

They particularly use wet roads especially with front wheel drive cars due to fact it looks tough when they can spin the back end around and keep control of the vehicle.... the only catch is a front wheel drive can't do that on dry pavement and your average driver can't either... that's why they also display words like  "professional driver in contolled environment... do not attempt these stunts" in the commercial to protect from lawsuit.

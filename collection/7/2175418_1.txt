If you have not had good luck with OTC's than contact your doctor for extranal med.. After experiencing several outbreaks of poison ivy, I would recommend going to the Doctor. if the "at home" treatment does not help in 2 or 3 days. I scratched a poison ivy site after doing a lot of yard work and got an infection at the site of the outbreak (this was before I realized what I had). The Dr. gave me a steroid shot and a prescription cream called Diprolene AF, along with an an tibiotic cream to treat the infection and I started seeing improvement within 24 hours. The Benedryl was also very helpful in controlling the itch, and there i s an anti itch cream over the counter called "Itch-X" that worked better than an y other OTC product that I tried.

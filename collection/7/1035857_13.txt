We aren't defending him at all. We're just stating facts. Why did we go into Iraq? I've heard time and again it was for WMD's and then sometimes I hear it's because of an Al Qaida connection. Which is it? We wouldn't have an issue if we were told the truth and they were honest with us. There is nothing but backhandedness going on in that White House and look who you're quoting...fox news. Yeah they're balanced...sure they are. There are plenty of republicans out there that are also fed up with the lies that this administration has told us. It's not a matter of whether or not Kerry won...that's done and over with. I haven't heard too many people complaining about Kerry not winning until I listen to people like you. I'm aware of the article Rolling stone did about the "voting problems" in Ohio. Maybe you should read that and then make an informed decision. And another thing...why is it ok for us to make WMD's (even though we're not supposed to) and no one else is allowed? I'm not saying I want them to be made but if we signed an agreement which we did, shouldn't we be following it too? Would it be ok if someone else invaded our country because there is a possibility for manufacturing WMD's

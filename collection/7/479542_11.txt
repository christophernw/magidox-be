Because he doesn't Love God and God's Creation. God is Love..and Satan isn't. 'Perfect love casts out all fear.' And that's just what God did with Satan. All 'badness' stems from fear. Satan worshipped himself and feared being overpowered by God, and rebelled against Him. (the human ego (sinful nature), being dualistic just as the mind of satan, does exactly the same thing). . Every time any of us rebel against God, Love and Goodness, we are essentially holding hands with Satan. Because Satan does his evil works THROUGH the sinful nature of humanity. We empower Satan every time we choose sin over God. . . The purpose of maturing and ripening Christians (which is my path) is to overcome the sinful nature that Satan decieves us through; and choose God 24/7. This happens via grace in the process of salvation --- we are transformed through Christ; made pure so that we may bear the fruit of the Holy Spirit, and do the works of Satan NO MORE. . . Satan feeds off of human fear and the effect of human fear: SIN. It is humanity's choice of SIN over God that keeps Satan alive and in control of the world. God has already chosen His People -- now He is waiting for His people to Choose Him. So far they are still choosing Satan.

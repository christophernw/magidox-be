Dark chocolate is said to have more of the antioxidants which have been found to be important to health by eliminating harmful toxins from the system.  This is good news because chocolate, once considered a "bad" food that caused or made acne worse, is now touted as something we should all have in our diet.  Just be careful not to overdo it, however, because chocolate is high in fat and calories.  Avoid milk chocolate because it has a higher sugar content and other additives which make less nutritious than dark or bittersweet.

If they were on the Earth at the time, then Noah would have taken them on the ark with him.  It could be that they were extinct before the time of Noah, or something happened to destroy them all after the flood.  My guess is that something happened BEFORE the flood... since if the dinosaurs were destroyed after the flood, then all the humans would have been destroyed as well.

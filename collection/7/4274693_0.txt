Having a strong brand name decreases risk that consumers feel when purchasing a product (take a customer buying a car, he or she want a reliable one that will last for years, if there are two similar cars, same price and stuff, the customer is more likely to purchase the one with a stronger brand name, they feel that there is less risk associated with it),consumer can notice it more easier,. hope thats what your looking for?

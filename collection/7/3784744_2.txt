First of all estimate the bleeding , is it heavy like a mentral cycle or just a few drops.......... Rough sex is a nono after 6 months, reason being some female may start to dilate just this early..by 7 months i was in 2cm. If you have cramps defenetly go see ER if just light , make a prompt DRs Appt. Bed rest, no heavy house chores and no sex for about 7 days.

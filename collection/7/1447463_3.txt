if oj can get away with murder you can get out of your lease. get a lawyer and ask him the same question, answer his and sit back and watch them get screwed. the maintance guy is there for you.In your contract or somewhere theyve stated what the apartment consists of... ( one bath ) two/one rooms... if something is wrong with bath or the room that wasnt there prior to you signing should be fixed because you signed the contract when all these things were working. good luck

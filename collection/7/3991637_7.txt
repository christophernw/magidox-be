As with everything else... the only way to become "good" at math is to practice, practice, practice.... As far as becoming "intelligent", well.....I can't help you there...maybe if you ask Santa..hehehe.... There are many ways to approach math that can help you learn it easier.... 1. As I said before..practice over and over again... 2. Relate to something you already know. For example..if you know how to add, but can figure out how to multiply, then add the same number over, and over again until you get the result (I.E.: 2+3=5,    2x3=?    2+2+2=6, therefore 2x3=6). 3. The third one is to forget what the teacher told you, and look for shortcuts (warning! Not EVERYTHNG has a shortcut!). For example in the multiplication table, any number multiplied by 9 equals one number lower, and addition to nine (8x9=?  One number lower than 8, 7, and 7+2=9, so answer is 72.  5x9=?  One number lower than 5 is 4, and 4+5=9, so 45).. EVERY other math can be simplified to a addition, or substraction.  Is THAT easy!

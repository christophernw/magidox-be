I agree with most of the above reasons.  AND aside from all the idiot perverts and juvenile pranksters using this forum - I think normal people are here to enjoy the social aspect of this.  It's like hanging out in a college rec room and shooting the breeze about random topics.  Sometimes the topics are interesting and cutting edge and other topics are just fun because they reflect common human experiences.

Our minds see upside down the same reason a camera does.  When light enters your eyes a picture is shown in your mind upside down because the light that comes in your eye is filtered into your brain through the lens in your eye.  The lens in your eye (and in cameras) will take the visual information at the top of the subject (what you are looking at) and place it at the bottom and the visual information at the bottom and place it on top.  Your brain then changes the information around so that you see what the subject looked like before the information came through your lens.

Businesses love a tax write off, hospitals do too. i'd ask the hospital first. Call everybody (businesses) there are some that just want the write off and others really care. Since you'll be asking for merchandise instead of cash your chances are MUCH better. Make sure and tell them you're not after money. A retailer that could liquidate (at full retail price as a tax write off) would be stupid not to get rid of excess inventory of slow merchandise.. . My mother used to do a little fund raising for my sister's high school band..businesses love giving merchandise. Even had a skating rink give away free skating passes.. . MAKE sure and send some sort of certificate or plaque etc that they can exhibit in their stores...they will greatly appreciate it and remember you next year when you come calling again.

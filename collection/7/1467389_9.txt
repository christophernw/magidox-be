C-sections are normally done when the female is too small through the pelvic area and would not be able to have the pups without problems.  Just like women, some can deliver normally and some have to have a C-section.  It is better to know in advance than during the process of having the pups.  Dogs that should have them and don't could die in puppy birth.  They will set the surgery for 3-4 days before the due date of the pups just like they do with humans. . Good luck.

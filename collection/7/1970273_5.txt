I'm not exactly sure what a hot molecule looks like.. . If you heat up a solid, the energy goes into increasing the vibration of the molecules, but they aren't going anywhere, so they aren't any faster.. . A car full of hot molecules only looks like it is going faster down the street.. . If you throw a hot potato the molecules move at the same speed as a cold potato thrown with the same force.  But you tend to get rid of the hot potato faster.. . If you heat up molasses you change its viscosity, so it pours out of the can faster.  The heat reduces the resistence to flow by overcoming the counteracting forces.. . Sure hope this helps.

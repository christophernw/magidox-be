Bring it on, and I will show you where you are wrong.. . Edit: This is the only way I could find to answer. Sorry buddy, proved you wrong in about 5 seconds. Read this http://www.physorg.com/news8460.html.  . Life does not have to come from all life. We have created, in a lab, all the building blocks needed for life from common chemicals. Sorry your argument doesn't hold up. You could have said that God created life using natural means. That is a way better argument than yours. Oh, using your argument, Who created God?, or was God created from nothingness? If in your mind if God was created from nothingness, Why cant other stuff be created from nothingness? Sorry buddy try using facts next time, or just face it THERE IS NO GOD. :) . . Everyone else sorry, this should be a private conversation but he didn't send me an e-mail.. .

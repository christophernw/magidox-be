Use either Frontline or Advantage.  Don't use the stuff from Wal-mart or grocery store it is NOT just the same but cheaper.. . I personally prefer Frontline as it stays on the skin and doesn't go into the blood stream.  Advantage is a little less safe in my opinion but it is more water proof and also kills ticks.

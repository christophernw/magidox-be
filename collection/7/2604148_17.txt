why would you want to tell someone they are fat. are you looking to insult someone or just hurt someones feelings for the heck of it. live and let live. im sure there are some qualities in yourself that if someone brought to your attention in a negative manner, it might just hurt your feelings. so better leave it alone, to spare her feelings. if she asks you on the other hand, and opens the door for you to express your feelings, then by all means speak up, but keep it respectful.

I have news for you every body is a bigot to a certain extent I know for a fact everyone in every single race has said something deragatory at one point or another about another race especially if they don't get along with the person. . . I don't know if that makes me or even them a racist. I have many friends of all races and colors but my advice to you is be the better person and try to be above the ignorance .. . personally I love every body except my enemies

In the short term, it helped prevent a potential war with France. Spain ceded Louisiana (much of the Mississippi Valley west of the Mississippi River) to France in 1800 in the Treaty of San Ildefonso, which provided the opportunity for Napoleon to create an empire in North America.. .    Thomas Jefferson grew concerned when he learned of Napoleon's intent, and when western citizens pressured the U.S. government to correct Spain's prohibition of the practice by U.S. ships of transferring their cargo from river vessels to ocean vessels for international trade.. .    Instead of attempting to force Spain to concede to U.S. shipping and so threaten war with France (which now owned Louisiana), or ignoring western demands, Jefferson negotiated to purchase Louisiana. Napoleon agreed to sell all the Louisiana Territory because yellow fever killed many of his soldiers in America, and because a fleet sent to support those soldiers was prevented from traveling there by winter conditions in the Netherlands.*. .    The purchase also seems to have set a precedent to act as a "loose constructionist," since there was nothing in the Constitution about obtaining land, which Jefferson did (even though he believed in a "strict constructionist" approach to the Constitution, in which he believed the government should be restricted in its practice to what the Consititution states specifically).**. . *This information comes from Brinkley, Alan, "The Unfinished Nation: A Concise History of the American People," Second Edition, McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., New York, 1997, pg. 191-192. . **I added to Brinkley's ideas here. Brinkley mentions the Louisiana Purchase as both good and bad in Jefferson's eyes. It was good because he solved the problem with westerns and with France; and it was bad because Jefferson was a "loose constructionist."

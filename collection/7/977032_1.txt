Because they are not chicken... they are eggs. . The eggs we consume are not fertilized by a rooster, they are simply the "feminine" input into conception. Taking into account that there is not even a chicken embryo (thank God) in the egg you can see how the taste would be different. . Considering that a feminine egg only contains half of the genetic information that will be passed on to the embryo, I suppose one could think an egg will taste like half a hen. ;-P.

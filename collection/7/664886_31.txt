I agree- there's never any negativity about Buddhism, Hindi beliefs, or even kabbalah......and heaven forbid you be negative about Islam!  (especially if you live in Australia).  I think maybe it's because the negativity about Christians stems from Satan's attacks on what the real threat to his rule in this world is: so why should atheists attack other religions...when as tools of satan, the only real threat to them is the love of Christ.

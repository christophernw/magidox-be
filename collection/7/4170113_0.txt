Kneading is a comfort thing that cats do. This is the motion they use in the nest when they nurse on their mama. Some cats will actually grip the blanket in their teeth while they knead, as if they're holding the mama's nipple. Some will drool a little. I've had cats that have done both those things.. . It's normal. Cats do it all the time and it shows that you give them comfort.

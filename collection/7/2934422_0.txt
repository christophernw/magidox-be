America hasn't won a war since WW2 and anybody who says they did is either Linden Johnson or George Bush....the fact that the 34th parallel is a buffer zone between north and south is in effect, shows that once again, America is great at starting a war and then folding like a house of cards..only today, a bombing campaign was in effect in Afghanistan, a country  that  was supposedly "job done" ...so if you want to know the answer, ask a Korean person

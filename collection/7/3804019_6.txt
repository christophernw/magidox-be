As far as we see into space there is no Giant Meteor headed for Earth.. . Also the government is doing something, ever heard of NASA DEEP IMPACT mission? We CAN hit a comet with a roket if we need to so we are well protected, no worries.. . As far as Mars is concerned... well it's a very hard logistical task to go there (and if you ask me fairly useless). As technology improves we can travel faster but even today a mission to mars will take more than 18 months and not many austronauts will be willing to do that. Besides we don't know that much about humans in space for a long time yet... what is the long time consiquence of 0 G? We have reasearched some of that on the ISP (International SPace Station) and I would say it is a huge step in trying to go to Mars. Still there are many problems to be solved before we ever get there... Unlike the moon Mars has significant gravity, unlike the moon Mars is flat out hostile to life as we know it (moon is too, don't get me wrong, but extremes are more noticable on mars), unlike the moon Mars has a "bad" orbit for us to go there (since if you miss a launch date you won't be launching in the next few months as mars does not circle the earth)  and so on.... . Going to the moon was relatively easy, going to Mars is too, but it is a step harder. As a tax payer though, I REALLY don't want to pay for another round of who can flex the mussle and science is better served with unmanned vihicles, but that's an opinion.

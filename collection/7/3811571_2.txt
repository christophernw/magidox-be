When my parents announced they were going to divorce, I got this weird little book from a girl I had known a long long time.  We used to be friends, but we had drifted apart as we got older.  Well she gave me this book "Hugs for Girlfriends".. . It was this book of Bible verses about friendship and about how my "friend" loved me so much she wanted me to come to the Lord.  There is nothing like getting a gift from someone trying to exploit your tragic circumstances to prostyltize at you.  . . I sold it on ebay for $5.

Harry is a half-blood because only half of his parents were originally from the wizarding world. His Dad, James, was born a wizard, but his mother, Lily, was muggle-born, (she was Harry's Aunt Petunia's sister).. The fact that she became a witch doesn't make him a pure-blood wizard. Both Harry's parents would have to be pure-bloods for him to be pure-blood too, (like Draco and his parents, Lucius and Narcissa).

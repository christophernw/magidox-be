Life is a journey.  Any Christian that gets made when proven wrong should only be mad at themselves, or perhaps you misunderstood their displeasure with themselves and accepted it at displeasure with you?  I don't know I wasn't there.  Personally I accept that being wrong only allows me the opportunity to grow in my faith.  Thus progress along the journey!

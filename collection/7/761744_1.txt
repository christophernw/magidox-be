Wow. I am suprised no one answered your question sooner.  It is a loan program where you basically "state" the income you need to make in order to qualify for the home you want to buy.  Sounds too good to be true, but that's the truth.  In most cases you must have EXCELLENT credit and you must have a job that supports your "made up income".  These loans have slightly higher, but still affordable rates.  It is only my opinion, but these loans should be used carefully so that you don't get too much house that you can't afford.  I recommend this type of loan for self employed or people who get paid with cash and don't do a good job reporting their earnings.

Do not forget that Palestine historically is the name of Israel lands. Contemporary Israel government called arabs living there "arab people of Palestine". Arab people liked this name very-very much and started to call themselves with this name starting from 1970-th. It is a bit funny: they use jewish name to prove their rights for this land :-)

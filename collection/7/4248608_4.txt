A small blood vessel may burst when you strain suddenly, such as when lifting something heavy, sneezing, coughing, vomiting, or straining on the toilet. Very rarely, the bleeding may be associated with a generalized bleeding tendency, such as in severe anemia.. . By the time you first see the hemorrhage, the bleeding has already stopped. The blood will gradually disappear by itself, but it may take as long as two weeks to absorb completely.. . You may be able to hasten the absorption process by using warm soaks (compresses) on the eye after the first 24 hours-but no sooner. Using heat too soon risks more bleeding.. . You shouldn't have any pain, but if your eye itches or feels irritated, you can use a decongestant eyedrop that can be purchased over-the-counter.

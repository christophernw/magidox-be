Spirituality is all about acceptance of others for being themselves. If one is truly spiritual, then there is less feeling of superiority over others. I suggest you not only pray for others but for yourself too, to be more understanding and live the life that you see to be spiritual. Good luck as it is easier said than done.     :)

Well, I can better grasp this concept for myself by understanding the belief of reincarnation. You have one good life, your next life kind of sucks, your next life it awful, your next life rocks...it varies for different people wether this life is going to be good or not. The purpose of having "tragedies" happen to you is so you can learn. That's what God (or a different Greater Force) wants us to have.

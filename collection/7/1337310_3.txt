Hilter refusing to listen to Rommell and instead keeping the reserves off the beaches and back to 'respond' to the invasion was a major contributor.... But, most importantly, was that the Allies had convinced the Furher that the invasion was NOT at Normandy, and it was merely a diversion! Hitler never ordered the reserves to the landing zones until the Allies had a solid beach-head.

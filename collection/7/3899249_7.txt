you know Larry the Cable guy was asked this question in an interview and said that he doesn't even know, then he mentioned andrew dice clay and how he always says "ya hear" after his nursery rymes. He said it's just like that and doesn't mean anything. . . That's Larrys version but when I hear people say it I hear go fu'ck yourself. Perhaps that's cause my ex had my 4 year old saying it to me whenever he came home from visitation. Apparently the judge thought it was inappropriate also because my kids dad now only gets visits every two monthes.

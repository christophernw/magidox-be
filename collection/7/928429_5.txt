Ah yes......The Sirens of Greek mythology....keyword, "MYTH" as in, they don't exist.  . . Although sirenomelia, also called "mermaid syndrome", is a rare congenital disorder in which a child is born with his or her legs fused together and the genitalia reduced. This condition is about as rare as conjoined twins and is usually fatal within a day or two of birth because of kidney and bladder complications, though there are two known survivors of this disorder alive today.

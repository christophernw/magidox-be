People before profits.  Credit unions work with their communities and make donations towards community causes, while big banks pad the wallets of their CEO's and key shareholders.  Credit unions are owned by their members, who vote on various topics- such as the board of directors that are appointed to the credit union.  You may or may not receive dividends on your shares as well as a "share of wallet" where members receive monies relative to their relationship with the credit union (such as how much they have in lending and term deposits) and how well the credit union profited over the previous year.

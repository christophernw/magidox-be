Others have it right when they point to the latin origin, 'to shine'.  Which leads to a host of other interesting words including lucifugous, essentially 'light-shunning', such as owls, bats, vampires and werewolves.  It is also the origin of the word Lucifer (old nick), and of course for those old fashioned matches.

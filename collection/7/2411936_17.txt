First of all what Christian people are you talking about?? What Christian religion?? Are you Christian or not??? If you are I tend to think by you're question that you are doing just what you're asking about. I believe there is only one God and Jesus is the son of God, which is God in the flesh sent down to earth to teach what He is really like and let us know Him more personally and to believe and trust in Him. That's why all the miracles were given and even with being shown people still doubted, so I think no matter what miracles are given to some it will never be enough. God made each one of us different individuals and gave us the right to make our own choices and our own thoughts. How wonderful He is for not creating a klone for what parent wants a child to say I Love You and yet in his or her heart there is no love there, how that would break any parents heart, and yet this Father of all creation still forgives and leaves the door, His door open for those who decide to believe. A lot of parents close their doors on their children with no remorse!!! Think about it!!!! and stop judging others and maybe you won't get so angry over the freedom of choice we were given!!!!

Detergent hands....?  I am not sure what you mean.  It sounds like hands that may be raw from being in detergent..?. I use virgin shea butter....no fragrance or additives.  I get mine from Nigeria, but if you go into a search engine and put "virgin shea butter", you may be able to get something closer to home.  A nurse I work with goes home to Nigeria and brings shea butter back here to us.  . . If you mean something else, please give more information.

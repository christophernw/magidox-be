Because of attention. They think they are funny and are being "creative" but in reality they are being annoying. On the other hand, you might have a few kids (or a few to many) on here that think it's fun to roam around and try to answer adult questions and see what kind of a reaction they might get... Because ultimatly, it is all about the reaction. If they get a reaction out of someone then they have accomplished what they have came here for..... . And if they are truely not a kid making up stuff and it is an adult just answering something "stupid" then they might just be either really bored or simple minded.

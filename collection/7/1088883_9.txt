Reward yourself for going to gym. Buy yourself things when u go to gym. Find out what is the reason and solve it. Once you make it a habbit, it will be easier. Play music that you like using a CD player etc.  Ask a friend or your date to encourage you.  . . Today I did running and gym both. So I ate the food I wanted, took off some time from office and ordered pizza at home with my kids.

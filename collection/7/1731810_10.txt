She will eventually adjust without help probably, but invite her to some christmas parties that you go to, birthday parties, and make her come. Then make fun of her if she feels out of place so that she won't come back.. I don't pray ever because I don't believe in god, and my friend invited me to his house for christmas and thanksgiving and made me bless the food. It was like Ben Stiller in Meet the Fockers. I don't know how you do those 'improvised' prayers that all sound the same, so mine was weird.

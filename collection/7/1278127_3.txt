It may have links to the voodoo god or "Loa" called Baron Samedi who is the God of the Dead and is often represented by a skull with a top hat on.  Other variations of this have also included sunglasses and cigars.. . This was used for advertising by a cigarette company I think and they were used after that on tattoos.  Also used in the James Bond film "live and let die" as part of a voodoo ceremony.

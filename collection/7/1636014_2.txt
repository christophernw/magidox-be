Catnip is an herb that drives cats crazy. I believe that the reaction to catnip is learned. We have 2 cats that go crazy for it. They watched us raise their mother who went crazy for it and now they do the same. However, our male cat just eats the leaves. . Catnip also makes a great herbal tea for people.

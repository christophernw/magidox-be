God is love.  He loves all, but cannot be in the presence of sin.  rather, sin cannot be in His presence.  if one was to enter His presence in eternity with sin in their heart, the torture would be far greater than that of hell.  hell was made for those who rebel against God.  not for people.  . . you've never read the song of songs have you?  any church that reads the Bible can tell you that sex is the most beautiful thing on earth, but is only protected under the sanctity of marriage.  its like fire: use it right and it is awesome.  use it wrong and it can be fatal.

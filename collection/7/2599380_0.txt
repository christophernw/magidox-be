Big western  konserns import products from countries that allow child-slavery, and the western world`s society get`s things for lower price. . When they discover that it`s too obvious, and starts to drop the selling, they move to another country where people work from age of 5 in factories. . . This pattern continues on an on forever as long as there are 1. Globalism, 2. poor people in the universe.. . Right to act globally works this way in the end, and not the way that human associations would prefer.

i know you probably won't believe this.... but if you want to be a disciple of Christ, you have to hear his word. Then you have to believe that all (ALL) of His word is true (that means the WHOLE Bible). then you have to repent of all your sins. Then you have to be baptized. not being sprinkled like when you were a baby. full immersion in water, like taking a bath (kinda). then you have to live your life faithfully and follow all of his word. *read the Bible, it gives you all of these answers and more. you could get lost in the Bible!* have fun and may God bless you! (find a Church of Christ near you, thats my religion and we believe that we are doing our best to serve God to our best ability because we follow exactly what the Bible says.

There are many factors that can make a period late including pregnancy, medication, stress, hormonal imbalance, just to name a few.. If you feel that you are pregnant the best thing to do would be to to wait until 2 weeks after a missed period, and have your doctor perform a pregnancy blood test as this is more accurate.  If it comes out negative, then your doctor can do further testing to determine the cause.

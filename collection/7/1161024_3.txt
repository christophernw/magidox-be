The infection is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).. . Once in the body, HIV attacks and destroys CD4+ cells, which are the part of the body's immune system that fight infection and disease. When HIV weakens or destroys the immune cells, it may lead to certain illnesses or diseases, such as some types of pneumonia or cancer, which are more likely to develop in someone who has a weakened immune system. These conditions are a sign that HIV has progressed to AIDS. . . HIV is spread when blood, semen, or vaginal fluids from an infected person enter another person's body, usually through sexual contact or from sharing needles when injecting drugs.. . HIV is rarely spread by blood transfusions in the United States because of improved screening procedures.
